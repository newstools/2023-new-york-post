Mother knows best. A Pennsylvania fifth grader composed a score, and thanks to her supportive mom, it’s now being played by musicians all over the world. Olive Wallace penned the tune at home, but when the 10-year-old violin and clarinet player performed it, she thought it sounded terrible, so she abandoned her sheet music on the kitchen counter. Her mother, Mimi, discovered it and posted it to TikTok, asking users to perform the piece. “So, my 10-year-old daughter wrote this,” she said in the video. “Could somebody play this? I need to know. I need to know if it’s any good or makes any sense.” “I come from a family of music teachers and I can read music but I don’t have perfect pitch,” Wallace told Today.com. “I wanted to know what Olive’s music sounded like, so I asked TikTok.” A few hours later, it had received approximately 1 million views and within the week, reached 4 million. “I really didn’t think it was going to be what it became,” Mimi, 42, told The Washington Post. “I was hoping to get like 500,000 views.” One music teacher performed Olive’s song on the violin and piano and shared it with the mother-daughter duo. “This is so fun — I swear that I see a couple sharps here indicating a key signature so I assumed it’s in D Major,” she said in her video post. “Mine is going to sound a little different. I hope she likes it!” Other musicians have played it on the clarinet or bass. “Always happy to help budding composers,” a harpist said.
