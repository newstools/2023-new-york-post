Two NCAA tournament contenders match up for the SEC Tournament final on Sunday. The controversial Brandon Miller will lead the Alabama Crimson Tide into a raucous environment in Nashville, Tennessee, to face the Texas A&M Aggies. Game time: 1 p.m. ET TV: ESPN Live Stream: ESPN+, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Alabama (-3.5) over Texas A&M: The Aggies have quietly become one of the nation’s most dangerous teams entering the NCAA Tournament. Buzz Williams’ crew has lost just once since the start of February and knocked off five tournament teams, including a six-point win over Alabama last weekend. However, that win came in College Station, where the Tide had their second-lowest scoring output of the season after shooting less than 34 percent from the field and 7-of-36 from deep. In a matchup of two of the best teams in the nation at getting to the line, the Aggies shouldn’t expect to attempt 18 more free throws again.
