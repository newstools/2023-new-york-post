Pete Davidson has vacated his secret bachelor pad in Brooklyn — and it has hit the market for $30,000 a month. The killer penthouse — revealed exclusively by Gimme Shelter — sits on top of a nondescript four-story building at 46 Old Fulton St. The edifice, which dates to around 1925, is in Brooklyn Heights — with sublime views of the city skyline from its private roof terrace. Although Davidson has moved out, legendary Brooklyn pizza joint L&B Spumoni Gardens, of Bensonhurst, is moving in. It’s opening an outpost in the building’s main-floor retail area. The stunning 4,500-square-foot penthouse comes with four bedrooms and 3½ baths, along with a massive 1,500-square-foot roof deck and private garden with an outdoor kitchen. There’s also a private garage and a keyed elevator. Davidson, 29, made headlines earlier this week when the Mercedes he was driving, with girlfriend and “Bodies Bodies Bodies” co-star Chase Sui Wonders, 26, crashed into a Beverly Hills residence — traumatizing a teen girl who was home at the time and thought there was an earthquake. Fortunately no one was hurt, according to reports. The family does not intend to sue the Staten Island-born actor and comedian, who was part of “Saturday Night Live” from 2014 until last year. Davidson had previously lived in a high-rise condo in his native borough — after living in his mom’s basement — but listed that spread for sale in late 2022 for $1.29 million. (It remains for sale at that same price today.) Early in 2022, he announced he would leave Staten Island for Brooklyn. This Brooklyn home includes an open living and dining area, a sleek chef’s kitchen, a separate walk-in laundry room, 11-foot ceilings, motorized shades, hardwood floors and custom closets. The main bedroom is 1,000 square feet, and boasts an ensuite bath with a large soaking tub and double vanities. The listing brokers are Carl Gambino and Justin Montero of Compass.
