Ja Morant won’t be back with the Memphis Grizzlies for at least another week. The Grizzlies announced Wednesday that Morant “will continue to remain away from the team for at least the next four games.” Morant, 23, was initially suspended two games by the team after the star guard went on Instagram Live early Saturday morning and flashed a gun while he was at a strip club in Colorado. Glendale (Co.) Police investigated the incident but announced earlier Wednesday that there was not enough evidence to charge Morant with a crime. “I take full responsibility for my actions last night,” Morant said in a statement on Saturday. “I’m sorry to my family, teammates, coaches, fans, partners, the city of Memphis and the entire Grizzlies organization for letting you down. “I’m going to take some time away to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.” The gun video came days after the Washington Post reported that Morant allegedly punched a 17-year-old boy during a pickup basketball game last summer and then revealed a gun. He was also accused of threatening a security guard during a parking-lot altercation at a Memphis mall. The Athletic reported Monday that the Grizzlies held a players-only meeting recently in which veteran center Steven Adams addressed the players’ behavior on the road. Morant, who earned his second consecutive All-Star nod this season, is averaging 27.1 points, 8.2 assists and six rebounds per game for the Grizzlies (38-26,) who are tied for second place in the Western Conference. Morant has already missed road games against the Clippers and Lakers, and he’ll now miss Thursday’s home game against the Warriors, Saturday’s home game against the Mavericks, Monday’s game in Dallas and next Wednesday’s road game against the Heat.
