It may have been the MLB playoffs, but for Kiké Hernandez it was more akin to the Super Bowel. On Thursday, as part of a Red Sox Twitter Q&A segment, new third baseman Justin Turner asked Hernandez — a previous teammate of his on the Dodgers — what the most embarrassing thing that happened to him during a game was. Unfortunately, the infielder had a down-in-the-dumps answer at the ready from his Los Angeles tenure. “[In the] 2020 playoffs, I had a tooth infection, so I was taking some antibiotics for my infection and one of the side effects was diarrhea,” Hernandez said. “We got a big out in a big situation during the NLDS and I screamed ‘F yeah!’ — I was DHing and I thought I farted. “I went out to lead off the inning, I struck out in three pitches. When I went in the dugout, I went straight to the bathroom and pulled my pants down … completely sharted.” Turner — getting a kick out of the story — asked for a bit more clarification. “So you’re saying you misjudged a fart?” he asked. “Uh no. What I’m saying is I sh-t my pants during a game,” Hernandez said. “In the playoffs.” It seemingly all worked out for the 31-year-old, who — with Turner and the rest of the Dodgers — went on to win the series 4-3 over the Braves before beating the Rays in the 2020 World Series. Hernandez joined Boston on a free agency deal after collecting the title, re-signing with the Red Sox for one year and $10 million this past offseason. No word on if the new contract came with an allowance for pants.
