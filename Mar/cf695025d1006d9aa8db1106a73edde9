The Panthers are on the clock! Ian Rapoport of NFL Media first reported that the Bears have traded the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft to the Panthers for a package that includes “multiple” first round picks. ESPN’s Adam Schefter pegs the trade compensation as this year’s and next year’s first-round Panthers picks, plus a late second-rounder in 2023 and a second-round pick in 2025. The Panthers also included wideout D.J. Moore into the deal. The Bears, who have Justin Fields as their starting quarterback, move down to No. 9 for their first pick in this year’s draft. Chicago “earned” the first overall pick by going 3-14 last season. Despite clearly feeling confident enough at the quarterback position to trade down, the Bears’ franchise is in a little bit of flux. After team president Ted Phillips stepped down following 24 years in the role, the organization hired former Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren to take his place. Warren is tasked with solidifying a new stadium deal for the Bears in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. The Panthers went 7-10 last year with a combination of Baker Mayfield, P.J. Walker and Sam Darnold at quarterback. It is nearly certain that they made this big trade up to the top of the draft because they have their eyes on a quarterback of the future. The four plausible names who that could be are C.J. Stroud (Ohio State), Bryce Young (Alabama) Will Levis (Kentucky) and Anthony Richardson (Florida). The Panthers hired Frank Reich as head coach earlier this offseason after parting ways with Matt Rhule midway into his third season on the job. Reich was fired by the Colts midway through last season after going 40-33-1 in four-and-a-half years on the sidelines in Indianapolis.
