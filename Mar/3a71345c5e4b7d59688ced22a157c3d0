A Texas mother fatally stabbed three of her kids and wounded two others after a child services worker checked in on the family Friday, according to a report. Sources told WFAA the mother attacked her young kids when a Child Protective Services worker arrived at the Italy, Texas, home for an unannounced visit. Ellis County police offered very little information Friday, but confirmed three children were found dead in their home near Stafford Elementary School at 4 p.m. Two others were rushed to the hospital, though their condition is unclear. “All victims were children,” Ellis County Deputy Jerry Cozby said. “Suspect has been detained in the case.” CPS had previously placed the children — all of whom were siblings — under the guardianship of another relative, the agency’s sources said. The worker visited the home Friday because she suspected the mother was having an unsupervised visit with the kids. “We are shocked by this incomprehensible tragedy, and already working with law enforcement to investigate how this happened, and why,” CPS told WFAA. CPS did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
