It’s their pluckiest ice cream flavor yet. Baskin-Robbins introduced its March flavor of the month, Chick’n & Waffles — but not everyone is crowing about it. The frozen treat consists of “buttermilk waffle flavored ice cream with plenty of crispy chick’n* and waffle flavored bites drizzled in a decadent bourbon maple syrup flavored swirl,” the company said. The ice cream chain, which was founded in 1945, said the sweet-and-salty dessert does not contain real fried chicken, but just tastes like it. “We pride ourselves on bringing innovative flavors to market, which is why when we saw the growing popularity of Chicken & Waffles on menus, we knew we had to create a bold flavor that would change the way our guests enjoy Chick’n & Waffles,” Hannah Suits, director of brand marketing for Baskin-Robbins, said in the release. “This flavor is a frozen twist on the iconic brunch dish, recreated in a deliciously deconstructed concept that is unique to our shops.” Some cringed at the thought of the new flavor. “I’m going to admit, I gagged when I read this,” @suebal said. @DineroDaPharaoh wrote, “So if I want COLD ‘chicken and waffles’ I go to baskin-robbins?” However, others are willing to give it a taste. “My curiosity was piqued manyfold with Baskin Robbins’ new March flavor,” @sandboxworld said. “Imagine ice cream that tastes like chicken and waffles. Now that is March madness!”
