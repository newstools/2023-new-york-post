King Charles is booting Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from their Frogmore Cottage home and offering the royal digs to disgraced Prince Andrew. An insider confirmed with Page Six that the monarch began the eviction process in January — the day after Prince Harry’s bombshell memoir “Spare” hit the shelves. Harry’s book contained a myriad of sensational allegations, including that Prince William violently shoved him to the floor and that Queen Consort Camilla leaked stories about the brothers to the press. “This eviction surely spells the end of Harry and Meghan’s time in the UK,” a source told The Sun, who first reported the news. They have not been offered an alternative home on the royal family’s massive estate. The couple is reportedly planning to ship the rest of their belongings to the US from the Windsor Estate cottage, which has served as Harry and Meghan’s UK home since Queen Elizabeth II gifted it to them for their wedding in 2018. King Charles has offered Andrew the keys to the five-bedroom home, which would be a significant downgrade from his current home at Royal Lodge. Rumors are swirling that the King wants to kick the Duke of York out of the sprawling mansion, which includes a pool, 98 acres of land and an astounding 30 bedrooms. Andrew — who was stripped of his royal titles for his alleged involvement in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme — has reportedly dug his heels into the ground and is pushing back against the move. “Andrew is resisting the idea of moving into Frogmore Cottage after he was offered it last week,” the source told The Sun. “But it shows Harry and Meghan are powerless to stop the eviction.” The eviction may have been the only form of communication between the king and his youngest son — sources claim the two haven’t spoken since “Spare was released.” It is still unclear whether Harry and Meghan will be invited to King Charles’ coronation. Insiders have said the king has completely written Harry out of the ceremony.
