Convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh shaved his head for his newest mugshot, hours after he was handed two consecutive life sentences for killing his wife and son. The disgraced former lawyer, who kept his distinctive red hair for most of his murder trial, stares coldly ahead while wearing a yellow jumpsuit in the latest mugshot, snapped after he was booked Friday at South Carolina’s Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center. He will remain in a single cell for the next 45 days at the Columbia facility — which is a maximum-security, level-three prison for male offenders, Fox News reported. Where Murdaugh is housed next is still to be decided. “He will be assessed, and we will determine what his permanent placement will be,” a source familiar with the matter told Fox. According to the South Carolina Department of Corrections, Murdaugh — “like all inmates” — will undergo a series of tests on his physical and mental health as well as an educational assessment. The South Carolina Department of Corrections told WLTX that it is standard procedure for new male inmates to get some type of haircut. After the evaluation, Murdaugh will be sent to one of the state’s maximum-security prisons to serve out his double life sentence, the SCDC said. After just under three hours of deliberation, a jury unanimously found the 54-year-old guilty of gunning down his wife Maggie, 52, and their son Paul, 22, on June 7, 2021, at their South Carolina hunting estate. Murdaugh was stoic as Judge Clifton Newman hit him with two life sentences on Friday morning. “I’m innocent,” Murdaugh, 54, said when given the chance to address the court. “I would never hurt my wife, Maggie, and I would never hurt my son Paw Paw.” Within moments of learning his fate, he was escorted from the courtroom in silence. In addition to the murder convictions, he is awaiting trial for a host of financial crimes, the total prison sentence for which could amount to over 700 years.
