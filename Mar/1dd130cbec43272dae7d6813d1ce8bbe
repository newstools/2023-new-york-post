The Massachusetts sports betting launch on Friday is getting closer and closer, and Massachusetts residents can get in on the action early with the FanDuel Massachusetts promo code. This great offer from FanDuel gives new customers $100 in bonus bets on launch day! If you aren’t in Massachusetts, new users can grab FanDuel’s standard new customer offer that lets you make a No Sweat First Bet up to $1,000, and if it loses, you get the amount wagered back as bet credits, also known as bonus bets. Click on the links below for more information on both of these offers ahead of the Denver Nuggets hosting the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Both offers can be used for any sports market on FanDuel. Massachusetts residents can use the FanDuel pre-reg promo code to score $100 in bonus bets for launch day on Friday. New customers not in Massachusetts can use the FanDuel promo code to get a No Sweat Bet up to $1,000. If you use the promo code and make a losing bet, you’ll get that money back as bet credits. Monday night’s Toronto Raptors vs. Denver Nuggets game is an excellent opportunity to try out either of the offers from FanDuel! The Denver Nuggets host the Toronto Raptors tonight in another opportunity to build on their 45-19 record that leads the Western Conference. FanDuel Sportsbook lists the Nuggets as six-point home favorites, and I think they can cover. Denver is really firing on all cylinders right now, and an average team like the Raptors will probably have a tough time slowing down the Nuggets at high elevation. Denver has bolstered its record with an 8-2 run in its last 10 games and now has a 29-4 home record, which leads the NBA. Nikola Jokic is having another MVP-level season, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. are both great scoring options, and Aaron Gordon is playing well in his role. Add it all up, and it’s tough to stop. The Nuggets can sometimes start slow in the first half, but they can flip a switch and reel off a quick scoring run to clinch a win just like that. Toronto should be able to hang with Denver early, but it’s hard to see the Raptors keeping up with the Nuggets for 48 minutes, so use the FanDuel promo code to back Denver covering the spread.
