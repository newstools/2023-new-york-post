Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Sunday: Ronny Mauricio launched a 452-foot homer in the Mets’ 10-4 exhibition loss to the Rays at Clover Park. The homer was the fourth this spring for Mauricio, and his second of at least 450 feet. Joey Lucchesi allowed three earned runs on three hits and a walk in the eighth inning. The left-hander will likely serve as rotation depth, but hasn’t been ruled out as a bullpen option for the team. Francisco Alvarez picked off Gavin Collins with a snap throw from his knees to first base in the third inning. Tylor Megill is the Mets’ scheduled starting pitcher against the Marlins in Jupiter, Fla.
