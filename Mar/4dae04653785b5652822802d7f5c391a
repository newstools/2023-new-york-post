This is the final game of the college basketball season before the beginning of March Madness. Mid-majors will be on pins and needles to see if their dreams will become a reality. On Sunday afternoon, Penn State and Purdue will look to stamp their ticket to the NCAA Tournament. Game time: 3:30 p.m. ET TV: CBS Live Stream: fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Penn State (+6.5) over Purdue: The Boilermakers were expecting a chance to avenge a pair of losses to Indiana. Instead, Purdue faces a team it beat by a total of 33 points in two meetings this season. It only makes the pressure greater for Purdue to claim its first Big Ten Tournament title since 2009. The Nittany Lions are unrecognizable from the opponent Purdue met six weeks ago, displaying incredible mettle in five straight wins by four points or less to punch their first NCAA Tournament ticket in a dozen years. Don’t fade Micah Shrewsberry and Jalen Pickett until this streak ends.
