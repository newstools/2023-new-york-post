Move over, Brad Pitt. Have a seat, Ryan Reynolds. Shania Twain has her eye on a new hunk. On “That Don’t Impress Me Much” — one of a string of hits from Twain’s 1997 blockbuster “Come on Over” — the country-pop queen famously quipped, “OK, so you’re Brad Pitt? That don’t impress me much.” But when Twain performed the single at the People’s Choice Awards last December, she flipped the lyric from “Brad Pitt” to “Ryan Reynolds,” as cameras panned to the “Free Guy” actor in the audience. But now the 57-year-old singer has moved on to yet another member of the Sexiest Man Alive club. “It’s Channing Tatum,” she told the UK’s Radio Times about the “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” star. “I’m trying to think how I would sing that … ‘OK, so you’re Channing Tatum’ — yeah, that works.” But more than likely, Pitt — who is actually a two-time Sexiest Man Alive, claiming the title in 1995 and 2000 — isn’t taking Twain’s latest sub as a snub. When asked about the Reynolds swap in January, the “Babylon” actor told the Movie Dweeb site, “I think we can share the wealth there. Yeah, Ryan’s a good egg, too. He deserves some love.” In fact, Pitt even suggested a couple of other Hollywood heartthrobs who should be next on Twain’s list. “I think she should pass it on down,” he said. “Maybe Leo [DiCaprio] … and then Austin Butler.” Twain will certainly have plenty of other opportunities to switch it up on “That Don’t Impress Me Much” when her “Queen of Me” Tour starts on April 28 in Spokane, Washington. The trek — in support of Twain’s “Queen of Me” album” released last month — hits New York’s Madison Square Garden on July 11.
