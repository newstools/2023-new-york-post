It was a reunion fans were jonesing for. Harrison Ford, 80, and his “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” co-star Ke Huy Quan, 51, sent social media into a meltdown Sunday after they were pictured hugging at the 2023 Academy Awards. Quan — who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — made his film debut in the “Indiana Jones” movie in 1984, when he was 12. Sunday’s viral moment came after Ford presented the Oscar for Best Picture to  “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” prompting Quan to return to the stage. Ford was seen embracing his ecstatic former co-star, who has spent the past several decades struggling to find film roles. The moment has been hailed as Quan’s comeback, with fans fawning over the fact that Ford was on hand to support him. “HARRISON FORD PRESENTING AN OSCAR TO KE HUY QUAN. RIVER OF TEARS,”  one Twitter user cried. “These two have been long-time for about 40 years, this is so wholesome,” a second person noted. Since Quan’s Oscar nomination in January, Ford has been vocal in his support of his old co-star. “I’m so happy for him. He’s a great guy,” said Ford to Entertainment Tonight. “He’s a wonderful actor. He was when he was a little kid, and he still is. I’m glad. I’m very happy for him.” “He is really terrific in his movie. And I’m so glad to see him and what he has become. I’m so happy for him. He’s such a happy guy, too,” Ford added in a separate interview with Uproxx. Quan, who arrived in the US as a refugee in 1979, beat more than 6,000 other actors for his role in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.” The following year, he appeared in “The Goonies,” cementing his place as a bona fide child star. However, as he grew older, Quan found it harder to secure silver screen roles and eventually transitioned into film production. He returned to acting with “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — his first acting gig in more than two decades.
