Mike White is effin’ gone. White, who started seven games at quarterback over the last two years for the Jets, agreed to a two-year deal worth up to $16 million with the Dolphins, a source confirmed. White will back up Tua Tagovailoa in Miami. For White, 27, this is a homecoming. He grew up in Pembroke Pines, Fla., and attended South Florida University before transferring to Western Kentucky. The Jets felt White was a quality backup and expressed some interest in bringing him back, but it did not make sense for them as they pursued a veteran quarterback that was going to cost a lot of money. The team also has Zach Wilson on the roster. White’s most memorable moment with the Jets came in 2021 when he started in place of an injured Wilson against the Bengals. He threw for 405 yards and led the Jets to a stunning 34-31 upset of Cincinnati, which would go on to win the AFC. The Hall of Fame asked for some pieces of his uniform to display from that game. After the game, he was referred to as Mike “Effin” White by his teammates and became a folk hero. White injured his arm in the Jets’ next game against the Colts and things fizzled out for him. White became a starter again in late November after Wilson was benched. Follow the Post’s NFL Free Agency live coverage White led the Jets to a win over the Bears but suffered broken ribs two weeks later in a loss to the Bills. He missed two games before returning against the Seahawks in a game in which he never looked like himself. The Jets liked White and he had a shot at grabbing the long-term starting job if he had not been injured. Now, he will be on a rival.
