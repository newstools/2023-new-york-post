Buster Murdaugh has gone to the dogs. A grim-faced Murdaugh left the $180,000 condo he shares in Hilton Head, SC with his lawyer girlfriend Saturday to walk his dogs around their neighborhood, the Daily Mail reported. Buster’s father, Alex Murdaugh, 54, the disgraced scion of one of the state’s most prominent legal dynasties, was sentenced to life in prison Friday for the murders of his wife, Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22. Buster has not returned to Moselle, the family hunting lodge in Islandton where the murders took place in June 2021. Islandton is about an hour from Hilton Head. By Saturday night the red-headed Buster was spied through a crack in the blinds of his Hilton Head condo, while his girlfriend, Brooklynn White, left with a friend to walk the couple’s dogs. Alex Murdaugh was given two life terms for the murders of his wife and son. The 26-year-old, who was at court every day for his father’s trial, has been left almost an orphan, with his mother and brother dead and his father sent away for life. Buster met White, when they were both students at the University of South Carolina Law School. Buster was expelled, however, allegedly over a plagiarism incident, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The Post and Courier reported that “the family had paid a well-connected Columbia lawyer, Butch Bowers, some $60,000 to help secure Buster’s readmittance.”
