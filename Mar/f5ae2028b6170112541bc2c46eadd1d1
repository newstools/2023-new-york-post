“Hey Alexa, what’s the best deal you’ve seen today on a digital assistant and smart speaker? I’m ideally looking for a huge price cut on a device that can help me stream music, tell the time, read me the news, play games, check the weather for me, and adjust the thermostats and lights in my home, if at all possible.” If you asked this question today of your Smart TV, Amazon Alexa, or any other Amazon-powered device, you’d most likely get a response along these lines: “try the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Generation), currently 50% off on Amazon.” Yes, you read that right. This week, Amazon’s most compact smart speaker is on sale for half off, coming out to just $20 total for a device with tens of thousands of uses. We’re not math whizzes, but if you can get at least 500 uses and applications for every dollar you spend on on a smart speaker, we know enough to know that’s a good deal. While this model of Echo Dot may be a slightly older, it’s still more than capable of keeping up with the best of them. Stream music from Spotify, Sirius XM, Apple Music, and more through rich, loud speakers, or call friends and family on your Echo Dot. Living in a larger space? You can also use the Echo Dot’s intercom feature to communicate with your family from a different floor, or simply have the Echo Dot keep a grocery list, tell you the weather, and more.
