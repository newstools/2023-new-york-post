Hair: it’s one of the main things that grows on people’s bodies. It handily beats out fingernails, and comes in close second to skin. For some, it’s a calling card. For others, it’s a nuisance, and if it is their calling card, they’d prefer a different one altogether. Many out there, wishing not to be known for their hair, spend hundreds on removal treatments, and hours of their lives getting to and from appointments, all the while lamenting: isn’t there a better way?
