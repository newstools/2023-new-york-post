The gunman sought in the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy outside a Police Athletic League hall in the Bronx was just nabbed in North Carolina, authorities said Friday. Jamir Scarbro, 20, was arrested Wednesday in Charlotte by the US Marshals Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force after the NYPD tracked him to the area, federal authorities said. Scarbro is accused of shooting two boys — ages 15 and 16 — outside the rec center on Longwood Avenue near Fox Street around 8:50 p.m. Jan. 19. The 15-year-old, identified as Josue Lopez-Ortega, suffered a gunshot wound to the head and could not be saved, according to police. The 16-year-old was shot in the leg and was expected to survive. Authorities believe the two teens were targeted as they walked out of the PAL among a crowd of people, although it’s unclear why. Scarbro is being held at Mecklenburg County Jail and is expected to be extradited to New York City to face charges.
