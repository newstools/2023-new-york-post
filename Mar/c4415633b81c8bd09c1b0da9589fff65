A New Jersey man has been busted for fatally shooting another guy in the head during a dispute in Upper Manhattan last month, authorities said. Tamir Styles, 45, of Somerset was nabbed Wednesday in the Feb. 15 murder of Charbel Azouki, 44, at West 163rd Street and Riverside Drive in Washington Heights, authorities said. Azouki of the Bronx was shot in the head and chest and taken to Lincoln Medical Center, where he succumbed to his injuries. The two men knew each other, police said. The shooting stemmed from some kind of dispute, cops said. Styles was arraigned Thursday on charges of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, authorities said. Prosecutors asked that Styles be held without bail, to which the judge agreed. He will reappear in court Tuesday.
