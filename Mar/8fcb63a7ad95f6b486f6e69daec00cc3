Elegantly appointed Rocco’s Steakhouse has drawn lovers of prime beef and Italian-accented veal and chicken to 72 Madison Ave. for nearly 10 years. Now it’s adding a second location at 100 E. 57th St., the former home of the original BLT Steak, which closed a few months ago. Rocco’s signed a lease for 3,500 square feet on the ground, 1,350 sf on the lower level and 600 sf on a mezzanine for a private dining room. CBRE’s Jared Lack and Andrew Goldberg acted for the landlord, the Dorchester co-op apartment building. Colliers’ David Tricarico and Christel Engel repped the tenant. The asking rent was $200 per square foot on the ground, which Lack called “a very fair number” today although “definitely less than prices were 10 years ago. He said that when the venue became available, he and Goldberg found that it immediately drew interest “from a who’s who” from major restaurateurs. The new Rocco’s will probably have close to 175 seats including in the private room.  Rocco Trotta and GM Pete Pjetrovic are partners in the venture.
