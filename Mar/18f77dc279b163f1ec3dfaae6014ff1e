Where have you bean? A Starbucks barista on TikTok is claiming her store has been out of espresso for two months — meaning that mochas, cappuccinos and lattes are a no-go. TikTok user @toreeisnotdead took to the social media platform last week to share her “help” message in a clip that has served more than 325,000 views. In the video, the barista shows herself standing at the register, with a sign above her head that reads “No espresso but…,” along with a big red stop sign. Below the stop sign, the store lists the items available for purchase, such as cold brew, chai tea, iced tea, refreshers and more. “Happy 2 month anniversary of still no espresso ,” the TikToker wrote of her store in white text over the clip. She appears to be based in New Jersey. The Post reached out to Starbucks and the TikTok creator for comment. In another shot, the barista shows a long tally of customers reportedly asking, “Omg it’s still broken?” On a white board, a list of items the store is allegedly out of include “espresso, dignity and cinnamon.” In the comments section, several employees and customers offered their sorrowful stories of missing restaurant items or non-working equipment. “One time our water was down and all we could serve was food,” one user laughed. Another alleged, “My Starbucks before I moved had no espresso over Christmas holiday shopping (inside target) and in late Jan still broken. I still think about them🫡.” “Wow the Starbucks I went to last weekend ONLY had espresso drinks and cold brew,” someone else disclosed. Another viewer divulged, “Once both our coffee brewer and our espresso machine was down at the same time for about a week .” Others found the barista’s misfortune amusing, with one user even joking about “realistic barista TikTok.” “Finally on realistic barista tok,” the person typed. A different user confessed, “As a barista that isn’t religious, i’m praying for y’all-.” In another video posted to her TikTok account, @toreeisnotdead claimed that a few days earlier, the store had also run out of coffee. This is not the first time Starbucks baristas have taken to TikTok to air their struggles. In January, one barista revealed she mistook a customer for a dog when taking an order at the drive-thru, while another shared she had been making decaf coffee for three months instead of serving up the regular brew.
