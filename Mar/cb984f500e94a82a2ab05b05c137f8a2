Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Friday: John Curtiss took another step toward contributing in 2023 by pitching a scoreless inning in an 11-6 loss to the Nationals at Clover Park. The righty signed a two-year deal with the Mets in 2022 after Tommy John surgery and spent the year rehabbing in Port St. Lucie. He could find himself in the bullpen this season. Tommy Pham, off to a slow start this spring, is now 0-for-13 with five strikeouts after another hitless game. Whatever you think of MLB’s new rule changes, they are so far having the desired effect. Though 17 runs were scored, the time of the game was just 2:23. Justin Verlander will make the start in Jupiter, Fla., against the Marlins at 1:10 p.m. at Roger Dean Stadium.
