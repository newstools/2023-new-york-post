This is hilarious. Although sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden can be an epic experience, it’s unclear if WWE star Liv Morgan enjoyed her time at the Knicks-Hornets game on Tuesday. The former SmackDown Women’s Champion was captured by MSG cameras appearing unbothered by a man who was chirping in her ear. Morgan, who didn’t even make eye contact with the unidentified male, was seen looking toward the court and fixing her hair while he was fully immersed in some sort of monologue. Meanwhile, Morgan appeared to say, “Yeah,” and nodded her head a few times. It’s unclear whether Morgan knew the man, or if he was trying to be friendly and strike up a conversation. The internet had a field day over the awkward moment, and Morgan’s name reportedly began trending on Twitter. “She definitely didn’t hear one word you just said bro,” wrote Knicks Nation, which shared the video. “When you’re on the first date and you realize it’s gonna be the last one too,” another person tweeted, while someone else wrote, “LMAO SHE AINT LISTENIN AT ALL.” Morgan seemingly responded to the buzz on Twitter, writing, “Y’ALL,” with a crying-laughing emoji. When cameras caught the now-viral moment, one of the broadcasters announced that Morgan will be part of the Road to WrestleMania supershow at MSG on Sunday, March 12. Morgan has been out and about in New York this week. On Monday, she attended the “Scream VI” premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater, where she looked stunning on the red carpet in a zebra-print dress. As of Wednesday, Morgan is not confirmed to be competing at WWE WrestleMania 39, which will take place next month at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Morgan won the Women’s Money in the Bank and the SmackDown Women’s Championship in July. The Hornets defeated the Knicks 112-105 during the Tuesday contest, which snapped New York’s nine-game win streak.
