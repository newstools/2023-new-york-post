A Long Island hit-and-run driver intentionally rammed into a cop and multiple police vehicles Thursday night, authorities said. The rogue motorist struck the cop – who was on foot – and slammed into the cruisers on 50th Street in North Lindenhurst around 7:35 p.m., Suffolk County Police said. The officer was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The driver fled the scene and still hadn’t been caught by Friday morning.
