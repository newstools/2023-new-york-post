These Marvel messages make a lot of Spidey-sense for fans of Queens’ own web slinger. Hundreds of kids have written letters addressed to “Peter Parker” and his comic book alter ego, “Spider-Man,” and mailed them to the real life Forest Hills address of the fictional super hero ever since the location was revealed in 1989. Now those missives, collected by a one time resident of the Ingram Street home who also happens to be named Parker, are on display at a museum in Williamsburg. The exhibit “Dear Spider-Man, Letters to Peter Parker,” will run until April 2. “Our board member Pamela Parker grew up in this household,” said Dave Herman, founder of the City Reliquary museum, told WABC-TV. “It was her mother Suzanne Parker who actually started getting some of these letters thinking they’re odd at first, maybe a prank.” Many of the scrawled notes begin with “Dear Spider-Man,” and are followed by messages such as, “I think you are the best superhero” or “Can you send me a costume?” The real-life Parker family lived at the home for 30 years and received the fan mail, which came from places as far as Switzerland, Russia and India. Spider-Man creator Stan Lee, told The New York Times that David Michelinie, who wrote the 1989 comic book, did not choose the Parker address on purpose. Now a Brooklyn resident, Pamela, 41, said Peter Parker became a kind of imaginary brother. “I really appreciate that Spider-Man is a local hero,” she told Yahoo Life. “I have become a Spider-Man fan. One of the really nice things about that superhero is that, unlike other superheroes, he comes from a real place.” Herman is proud to share the letters, belonging to a true New York City superhero. “Spider-Man exemplifies the spirit of a true New Yorker, made of grit and determination,” he told Yahoo Life. “Always ready to stand with and protect his fellow citizens.”
