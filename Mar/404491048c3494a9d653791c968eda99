A Texas tourist was held in a headlock in Midtown Manhattan Sunday morning as she and another woman were robbed at knife-point, cops said. The two women, whose ages weren’t released, were outside West 45th Street and 11th Avenue around 12:30 a.m. when two males approached them and demanded their property, police said. One of the robbers had a knife and took one victim’s handbag and cell phone, police said. The tourist was placed in a headlock but no property was taken from her, according to cops. It wasn’t clear where the second woman was from. One of the robbers was described as a Hispanic male wearing a black hat, black jacket with a white shirt and black pants, police said. Cops had no description of the second male suspect. The purse was found empty. Neither victim was injured.
