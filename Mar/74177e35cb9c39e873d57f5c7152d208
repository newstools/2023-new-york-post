A Brooklyn man with a trigger-happy criminal history was arrested in the shooting that left two teens wounded near their Brooklyn high school Tuesday. Cops cuffed 21-year-old Ousmane Diallo, of Crown Heights, for allegedly opening fire on the students in Sunset Park around 2:30 p.m. The teens were inside a bodega across from PS 371 Lillian L. Rashkis High School when they were each shot in the shoulder. The suspected gunman is believed to be a member of the Insane Gangsta Crips gang and is well-known to cops, law enforcement sources said. In August, Diallo was arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault and other raps for a January 2022 shooting in Crown Heights. He was out on a $500,000 bond in that case, which is still open, according to online records. He also has prior arrests for assault, robbery and two grand larcenies, according to the sources. “He always has a gun and is a known shooter,” one Brooklyn officer told The Post. “He is a suspect in other shootings.” Diallo was charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to Tuesday’s shooting, police said. Both victims were listed in stable condition at NYU Langone Hospital – Brooklyn. It wasn’t immediately clear if they were the intended targets. A worker at the bodega said one of the teens had gotten into a loud shouting match with another person a day earlier.
