The Jets want to retain the services of Quinnen Williams, one of the top defensive linemen in the NFL, with a long-term contract extension. On Sunday, they did the next-best thing for the Williams family: They re-signed his older brother, Quincy, a starting linebacker and part of a strong defensive unit. Quincy Williams, 26, received a three-year contract worth $18 million, a source confirmed, with $9 million in guaranteed money. He can earn another $3 million in incentives. He started 28 games the past two seasons and amassed 110 and 106 tackles, respectively. In an overtime victory over the Titans in 2021, Quincy and Quinnen became the first brothers to both get a sack in the same game for the same team. The Jaguars selected Quincy Williams in the third round in 2019. He played two seasons in Jacksonville before the Jets claimed him off waivers in September 2021. There is now some clarity as to what the market might be for Quinnen Williams after the Commanders on Sunday re-signed Daron Payne to a four-year deal worth $90 million, with $60 million in guaranteed money. That figures to be a starting point for negotiations between the Jets and Williams, 25, who is coming off his best season, with a career-high 12 sacks. The Jets picked up his fifth-year option and he is on the books to make $9.6 million in 2023. After the Jets ended their season, Quinnen Williams expressed his desire to get a long-term deal done before the start of the offseason workout program in the spring. “Everybody knows I’m a team guy, man,” Quinnen said. “I do feel like I deserve to get a contract done before the offseason program just because I did everything right on the field and everything right off the field. Having the organization behind me just like I’m behind them to show that they really support me is a major thing for me.”
