An Indiana teenager is believed to be in “extreme danger” after she disappeared from her family home earlier this week, police officials and family said. Emily Barger has been missing since early Monday morning, when her father awoke to find the 14-year-old gone from her bed, according to a Facebook post from shortly thereafter. Indiana State Police said late Tuesday the Georgetown, Indiana, teen was last seen around 1 a.m. Monday. Emily is 5-feet tall and weighs around 85 pounds, with blonde hair and blue eyes, police said. Officials did not know what she was wearing. Georgetown is located approximately 120 miles south of Indianapolis. Emily’s father reported her missing and police are still “actively investigating” her disappearance, Chief Deputy Jeff Firkins with the Floyd County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday. Firkins said investigators had reached out to several other agencies in connection with the ongoing search. Shawn Barger, who identifies as Emily’s father on Facebook, has posted several details about his daughter and the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. Barger described how his daughter’s bed was empty on Monday morning, but her phone was at the home. He later wrote that he believed his daughter was with a man who possibly drives a red truck. On Wednesday, he begged the teen to return home. Authorities are asking anyone with information related to her whereabouts to dial 911 or call the Floyd County Sheriff’s Department at 812-948-5400.
