This awards show still slaps — even without Will Smith and Chris Rock. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” nabbed seven wins on 11 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actress for star Michelle Yeoh and Best Director for filmmakers Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan. Yeoh became the first Asian actress to win the Best Actress Oscar. Brendan Fraser won Best Actor for his controversial portrayal of a 600-pound gay man in “The Whale” at the 2023 Oscars ceremony, held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Slap-ready late-night talker Jimmy Kimmel hosted the ceremony for the third time. See below for all of the winners from throughout the night.
