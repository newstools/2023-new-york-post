Plaxico Burress knows first-hand just how bad this can turn out. Burress, who infamously shot himself out of an NFL career after he accidentally fired a concealed gun in a New York City nightclub, issued a stern warning to Grizzlies star Ja Morant, who has been embroiled in a firearm controversy – among a string of other off-court incidents. “If you can’t learn anything, learn from me,” Burress said Tuesday on “The Carton Show.” “Make better decisions because you really don’t want for him to have that label being that he’s so young. He has the opportunity to be the face of the NBA. He’s that great of a player.” Morant, 23, recently made headlines after he appeared to brandish a pistol at a Colorado bar – which he streamed live to his Instagram account. Glendale, Co., police are now investigating the incident, and the Grizzlies suspended Morant indefinitely after the live stream video. It’s far from Morant’s only transgression. Per a report in The Washington Post, he was accused of punching a 17-year-old at his home and threatening him with a gun. The same report said that Morant threatened a security guard at a mall in Memphis, with a member of his entourage allegedly shoving the guard in the head. Burress, who caught the game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl XLII for the Giants over the then-undefeated Patriots, spent two years in prison over a gun charge after he accidentally shot himself in the leg while out at the Latin Quarter club in 2008. Burress did eventually return to the NFL in 2011 with the Jets, but only amassed 654 yards in the next two seasons; he signed with the Steelers halfway through the 2012 season. Burress, for one, hopes that Morant can avoid a similar fate. “You want to see him mature as a person as his game is getting better, and I think that all comes with time and being around the right people,” Burress said.
