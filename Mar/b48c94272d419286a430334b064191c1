Derek Carr didn’t seem to get the message, so Nick Mangold is trying again with Aaron Rodgers. As reports emerged Tuesday that Rodgers has had talks with the Jets as the longtime Packers quarterback mulls his NFL future, Mangold, the former seven-time Pro Bowl Jets center, took to Twitter to try to get Rodgers’ attention. “I’m going to try this again. First time didn’t work out… What’s the word @AaronRodgers12? No one tells me anything so I figure I’d go to the source,” Mangold wrote. “Hit me up if you need a realtor.” The tweet came two days after Mangold used the same schtick with Carr, who ended up signing with the Saints on Monday. “What’s the word @derekcarrqb? No one tells me anything so I figure I’d go to the source. Hit me up if you need a realtor,” Mangold wrote to Carr. Trey Wingo first reported after midnight that the Jets and Rodgers “had conversations” on Monday. Rodgers, 39, received permission to speak with the Jets, according to NFL Network. Rodgers, who is due roughly $59 million this year, has not yet decided if he wants to retire, play a 19th season with the Packers or play for another team. He recently embarked on a “darkness retreat,” in which he spent four days in complete darkness in part to contemplate his next move. While Rodgers said last week on the “Aubrey Marcus Podcast” that he has reached a “deep calm” after the retreat, he has yet to reveal his plans. Mangold, 39, spent his entire 11-year career with the Jets and was inducted into their Ring of Honor during the 2022 season.
