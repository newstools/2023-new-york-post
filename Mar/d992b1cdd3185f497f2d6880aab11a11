A mom accused of hosting secret parties where she watched her teen sons’ friends having sex was attacked by inmates at a California jail. The five inmates, who are being held at a Santa Clara County jail, allegedly kicked Shannon O’Connor and beat her with their bare hands, according to court documents obtained by KRON. The five inmates — Erika Amaya, Danielle Chavez, Sophia Vigil, Anita Quiroz and Marjaana Gardea — allegedly attacked O’Connor, 47, while inside a dorm room on Oct. 24, Los Gatos Sheriff’s Deputy Frank Thrall wrote in court documents. O’Connor has been locked up at Elmwood Correctional Facility since she was arrested for throwing booze-filled teen sex parties during an eight-month period in 2020 to 2021 without her husband’s knowledge. Prosecutors said the “Party Mom” met the then-14 and 15-year-old teens through social media and through her sons, who attend Los Gatos High School. The girls told investigators that O’Connor watched as they were sexually assaulted by the boys. The girls “would vomit, be unable to stand and fall unconscious,” prosecutors said. During one party, O’Connor allegedly handed a boy a condom and pushed him into a room where an intoxicated 14-year-old girl was lying on the bed. “[The girl] was afraid, ran and locked herself in the bathroom, prosecutors said. O’Connor, who has been awaiting trial, was attacked by the five inmates for about 16 seconds before deputies broke up the fight. The alleged party mom didn’t fight back, Thrall wrote in court documents. She was treated at the hospital for injuries. Her alleged attackers are scheduled to appear in court on Thursday to face charges. Meanwhile, O’Connor is facing 39 counts, including felony child endangerment and sexual battery. O’Connor, who worked as an administrative assistant at Aruba Networks, also faces fraud charges for more than $120,000 in unauthorized charges on a company credit card.
