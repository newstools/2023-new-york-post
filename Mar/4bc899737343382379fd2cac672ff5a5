After just more than a month on the market, Lena Horne’s former apartment has found a buyer for its listing price. The late Broadway icon’s former Upper East Side  perch traded hands for the $2.19 million it asked upon listing back in October. The buyer, top CORE broker Emily Beare, scooped up the unit after 38 days on the market, public records show. (It entered contract in late November.) Beare did not have further comment when asked about the purchase. The generously sized Manhattan unit measures approximately 2,100 square feet and comes with a monthly maintenance fee of nearly $6,000, according to StreetEasy. The Brooklyn-born Horne — who had an illustrious career as both an entertainer and a civil rights activist before passing away in 2010 at age 92 — first moved into the building in the early 1980s and lived there until her death, The Post previously reported. The unit was previously a separate one-bedroom and a studio, but Horne combined the two into the sprawling space that remained her sanctuary. Horne’s daughter, the journalist Gail Buckley, inherited the two-bathroom, fifth-floor abode upon Horne’s death — and it was Buckley who put the unit on the market in the fall. “The apartment includes original oak hardwood floors, beamed ceilings, and unique built-ins throughout,” the Corcoran Group listing for the apartment advertised at the time. “There’s also an oversized eat-in kitchen, formal dining room, and a massive 450 [square foot] primary bedroom suite.” The listing went on to note that the kitchen was recently updated and includes a separate breakfast nook. Located a block from Central Park, the 23 E. 74th St. building, known as the Volney, was once a historic hotel before being converted into a co-op. In addition to Horne, the humorist Dorothy Parker also once called the building home, until she passed away there in 1967.
