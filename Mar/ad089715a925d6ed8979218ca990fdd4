Both New York teams will clash at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night when the New York Knicks host the Brooklyn Nets. The Knicks are listed as seven-point favorites on bet365 Sportsbook, and I think they should be able to cover. New York has been playing great basketball recently and will come into this game better rested than the Nets. Brooklyn will be on the second night of a back-to-back after hosting the Milwaukee Bucks last night, while the Knicks last played on Monday. Travel wonâ€™t be an issue for the Nets, but the Knicks will have fresher legs. New York is also just a better team. Julius Randle is having another All-Star season, Jalen Brunson has been a fantastic addition at point guard, and its role players are stepping up. It has won six in a row to improve to 36-27. Mikal Bridges and Cam Thomas are capable of big scoring nights for the Nets, but the Knicks are the more complete team with an extra day off beforehand, so take New York to cover at home on bet365 Sportsbook with bonus code NYP365.
