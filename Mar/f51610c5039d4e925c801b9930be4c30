Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Monday: DJ LeMahieu picked up a pair of singles in the win. On the first, he was thrown out on a close play trying to stretch it into a double, but the second single drove in a pair of runs. Aaron Hicks dropped a fly ball to left field on the first batter of the game, a play that was reminiscent of some of his late-season struggles last season. But unlike last year, he bounced right back, ripping a single and a double in his first two at-bats. Willie Calhoun just continues to hit. The non-roster outfielder, who is trying to make a case for the left-field job, went 2-for-3 with two singles and is now hitting .571 (8-for-14) with a 1.482 OPS through six games. The Yankees have their first off day since camp began.
