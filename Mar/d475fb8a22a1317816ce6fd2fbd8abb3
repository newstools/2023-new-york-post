She was fed up. A DoorDash driver has gone viral when she refused to give a man his food after he only tipped her $8 for a delivery. The video, which was been viewed nearly 1 million times on Youtube, shows Ring camera footage of the woman yelling at the man for the seemingly measly tip when she went on a 12-and-a-half mile trip to collect the food. According to the woman, the man must not “must not realize” how far she traveled to collect the food. The woman explained that she had to drive to Commack, Long Island to pick up the savory food and then travel to Smithtown, which the woman claimed took her 40 minutes. According to the man, the drive should have only taken 15 to 20 minutes. “It’s not, you need to try and drive it. I just drove it, it’s 40 minutes. It’s 12 and a half miles,” said the angry driver. “What the h–l are you looking for? I gave an $8 tip,” said the man when the woman asked him to adjust the tip. It was then the woman claimed that she was going to return the food and begins to leave. The Post reached out to door dash for comment. Several people slammed the driver. “This woman has never worked for tips before. Eight dollars is a Home Run,” said one user. “As a door dash driver, an 8-dollar tip is good money!! I can’t believe she took the food back,” said another. “As someone who used to do uber/uber eats, I find great joy when entitled drivers like this get fired,” a third person said. “The fact that she felt so entitled as to stand there and argue with him is fascinating,” said a fourth person. “Honey, you do realize you can accept or decline delivery jobs right? If you didn’t realize the distance, Maybe you should be more observant while doing your job.”
