An Indiana teenager last seen early Monday — who was believed to have been in “extreme danger” — was found safe, and the man she was with has been arrested, according to officials. Emily Barger, 14, was located late Wednesday in Attica, Indiana — over three hours north of her Georgetown home, officials said. The girl was found after police received a tip that she “was staying in a shed behind a residence in Attica,” the police department said in a press release. Shawn Barger, who identifies on social media as Emily’s father, previously said he believed his daughter was with a man. He wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that authorities “got” the guy. Police nabbed that person, identified as 18-year-old Terry Ross, while he was walking in Attica. He has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The Floyd County Sheriff’s Office said the investigation in Attica was ongoing and that the police department would continue to work with local partners regarding potential charges. Floyd County Chief Deputy Jeff Firkins previously told The Post that Barger reported his daughter missing, and officials said she was last seen around 1 a.m. Monday at her family’s home. Barger wrote on Facebook earlier this week that he discovered Monday morning his daughter’s bed was empty, her window was cracked and her cellphone had been left behind.
