They’ve received their royal titles but one thing Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet haven’t gotten is an invitation to their grandfather’s coronation — and apparently, it may not be forthcoming, according to reports. While their parents, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, received their invites to King Charles’ May 6 coronation, their two young children weren’t included, according to The Sunday Telegraph. When asked if the kids, ages 3 and 1, were on the guest list, one royal source told the outlet the pair were “very young.” Harry and Meghan, who have infamously antagonized the royal family since “stepping back” from royal life in a move now known as Megxit, have yet to confirm whether they will attend the historic event. Some suggested to The Telegraph Archie and Lilibet’s presence would be discussed once Harry and Meghan make their own decision about attending. If the couple does come, they shouldn’t expect a warm welcome, one source told the Daily Mail. “They will be given the cold shoulder by very many relatives. One said to me, ‘I hope they’ll be seated in Iceland,’ ” a friend told the outlet. Two of Prince William’s children — 9-year-old Prince George, a future monarch himself, and his sister, Princess Charlotte, 7 — are expected to attend, while Queen Consort Camilla’s grandchildren are expected to have an official role in the ceremony.
