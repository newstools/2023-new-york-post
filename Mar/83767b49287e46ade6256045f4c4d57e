Nine firefighters were injured in a five-alarm inferno that tore through multiple homes in Queens Tuesday night. The blaze ignited inside an attached, multi-family home in Woodside around 9:45 p.m. and quickly spread to neighboring homes, the FDNY said. The fire burned through both floors of the two-story building at 37-18 59th Street and expanded to three separate homes, according to the department. Firefighters fought the roaring flames for roughly three hours before they finally brought it under control around 12:45 a.m. Nine smoke-eaters were transported to Cornell Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, the FDNY said.
