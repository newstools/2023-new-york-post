These chickens have some im-peck-able tricks. A group of athletic Australian chickens have locals flocking to watch their egg-citing moves — and one in particular has attracted attention for her weekly bodysurfing session. Owner Elaine Janes began taking her chicks to Point Lonsdale during the pandemic and has continued the routine for the past 18 months. One of her feathered friends is named Mrs. Chook — an Australian slang term for chicken — and she slowly began wading deeper into the waters each week. Janes now spends her beach mornings tossing Mrs. Chook into the shallow waves of the Indian Ocean about five times per session. “You cannot make a chook like the water, particularly the ocean, but this one has a passion,” Janes told 9News. “She has a passion of being in the water and she has a passion for bodysurfing. Just have a look at her face, it is pure contentment, happiness, joy.” The other chickens sit along rocks or explore the sand before returning home to get showered and toweled off. They may even get treated to a blow dry if necessary. The group has captivated locals, who enjoy starting their Tuesday mornings with the chickens at Ocean Grove Beach, and online fans who enjoy Janes’ TikTok videos. And Mrs. Chook isn’t the only brave one with hen-durance. Janes’ other chickens are often seen on TikTok wing-ing it around the skate park. A fluffy white chick named Princess Pom-Pom and a multicolored rooster called Squiggles can be seen online rolling along on their skateboards. Meanwhile, in Alaska, a pet pig named Elvis Pigsley was recently rescued from a snowy roadside and given a police escort home. A photo of the pink porker sticking its snout out of the back seat of the cop car went viral after the Anchorage Police Department posted an update online. “We’re all familiar with refrigerated bacon, we just never thought we’d respond to a call for service related to that topic,” the APD wrote.
