Alex Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster, broke down outside court after his father was convicted of killing his mother and brother, a source told The Post on Friday. “Buster held up pretty well until the cameras were off him — but then he collapsed,” said a source who was at the Colleton County Courthouse when Murdaugh, 54, was found guilty of the grisly double murder. “He was crying uncontrollably. The uncles [Alex’s brothers, John Marvin Murdaugh and Randy Murdaugh] finally got him into a car.” Buster, who’s stood by his father in the aftermath of the murders of his mother, Maggie, and his brother, Paul, on June 7, 2021, was stone-faced in court Thursday night when the verdict was read. Toward the end of the six-week trial, the redhead took the stand in the former lawyer’s defense. Alex Murdaugh was given two life terms for the murders of his wife and son. Despite his overwhelming emotions Thursday night, Buster was also back at the Colleton County Courthouse for sentencing Friday morning. He remained composed as Murdaugh was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the killings.
