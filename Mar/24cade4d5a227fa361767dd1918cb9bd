Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Saturday: While top prospects Francisco Alvarez, Brett Baty and Ronny Mauricio are mostly known for their offense, outfielder Alex Ramirez has impressed with his speed and glove in center, which Buck Showalter pointed out. “He glides out there,’’ the manager said after Ramirez made another nice play in a 15-4 win over Miami at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla. Zach Greene, plucked from the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft, had his first poor outing of the spring, giving up two runs in his one inning of work. Showalter spent time before the game in the visiting manager’s office speaking with former Giants and Jets coach Bill Parcells, who lives near Jupiter. The two go back to their days in Texas, when Showalter managed the Rangers and Parcells was with the Cowboys. Their tenures in Arlington both lasted from 2003-06. Kodai Senga will make his much-anticipated Grapefruit League debut against the Cardinals at Roger Dean Stadium at 1:05 p.m., with Jose Quintana set to follow him.
