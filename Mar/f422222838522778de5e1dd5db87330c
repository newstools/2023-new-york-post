Draymond Green has an issue with the timing of Black History Month. In a press conference following the Warriors’ 123-105 comeback win over the Trail Blazers on Tuesday, Green explained why he believes the U.S. should “get rid of” Black History Month. “Black History Month, at some point, can we get rid of it? … Why do we gotta keep getting the shortest month to celebrate our history?” the Warriors forward asked. “We’ve got governors who want to take our history out of schools, and I’m not going to be the fool to say, ‘Yeah, we can celebrate it for 28 days.’ So at some point, I’d like to get rid of it. We’re making all these changes in the world — can’t talk about these people, can’t talk about those people, can’t say this, can’t say that. “At some point, it’s time to get rid of Black History Month. Not get rid of Black history, like they’re trying to do. But Black History Month? Nah, teach my history from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, and then do it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. That’s what I’d like to see.” Green was seemingly referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in January rejected a proposed Advanced Placement high school course on African American studies, suggesting the class “significantly lacks educational value.” Green — who wore a Black History shirt postgame  — said he “just threw this shirt on because I didn’t have another shirt to throw on.” Green finished with 12 points, nine assists and eight rebounds in the win over Portland at Chase Center. The 32-year-old forward returned after missing Golden State’s victories against the Rockets and Timberwolves on Friday and Sunday with a right knee contusion. Green sustained the injury in the third quarter of a loss to the Lakers last Thursday after bumping knees with L.A. forward Jarred Vanderbilt. Green is averaging 8.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game this season. The Warriors host the Clippers on Thursday.
