It’s pretty hard to miss. A mom has gone viral after posting a Tiktok of what she said was supposed to be an outdoor cactus that spurts water … instead, she got a cactus that very closely resembled male genitals. The video was posted in January and has since gained nearly 900,000 views and set to Sam Smith’s “unholy.” “I accidentally bought my child an inflatable penis,” reads the in-video caption. Posted by Sarah Dyer, the video shows the unfortunate design spurting water out of a slit on the top. The phallic fiasco caused Tiktok users to burst with delight. “Oh they knew EXACTLY what they were doing when they designed that thing,” laughed one person. “It comes out in full bursts,” joked a second. “Nooo it was supposed to be Innocent,” chimed in a third person. “I’m shocked I have one of those and I never clicked till now,” a fourth person commented.
