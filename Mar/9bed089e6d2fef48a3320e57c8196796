iSpy an iPhone illusion. Billions of Apple-made smartphones have a built-in optical illusion – but can you spot what it is? At the bottom of most iPhones – at least since the iPhone 7 – there are speaker grilles on either side of the charging port. But the designers have fooled customers, as there’s really only one speaker on the right side. To test it, covering the speaker on the right side while playing music will muffle the sound, but blocking the left won’t make a difference. While the design varies between Apple devices, most iPhones have this tricky feature, which is seemingly meant to create aesthetically pleasing symmetry. In some cases, the extra grille actually acts as a microphone, and prior to the iPhone 7, the phones had a designated hole for a microphone; however, it wasn’t crisply symmetrical like many Apple devices. Cue: the fake speaker. But that isn’t the only quirk found in iPhones. Consumers were recently angered by the device’s energy-efficient settings, which slow down charging. The somewhat new feature opts users into lowering their carbon footprints by only charging the battery with lower carbon emission electricity. Angry customers took to Twitter last week just after the tech giant announced an update that will contain 31 new emojis, such as new heart colors, a moose, a donkey, a jellyfish and peas in a pod, among others. The company also unveiled its latest iPhone 14 and 14 Pro models, which have been dubbed as overly-sensitive due to the “Crash Detection” feature that dials 911 when the device detects the owner has taken a tumble. But even minor falls have triggered emergency communication, inundating dispatchers with potentially unnecessary calls. Apple users have additionally gotten creative with their use of the company’s various smart devices, with some geniuses even placing AirTags in their luggage to track their bags should they get lost.
