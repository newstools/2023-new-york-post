The more we learn about how certain lifestyle choices can negatively affect the environment, the more you may want solutions to decrease your own impact. This year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) showed off tech gadgets that can make your life greener without any dramatic lifestyle changes. Composting your food waste is just one way to help the planet during your daily routine. Reencle’s CES featured composter makes composting easier than ever with a noiseless, odorless, and efficient way to turn your food scraps into fertilizer, now for just $479 ($699). Wave your hand or foot over the censor to automatically open the lid and toss your food waste inside the composter. This is a small change to make in your usual routine. Just toss your food scraps in the Reencle instead of your trash can. No need to worry about any stinky smells coming from the Reencle composter with three layers of filters to eliminate odor. Reencle’s microbes work inside the indoor food composter to devour your food waste, no matter how salty or acidic, hot or cold. You can add food at any time because the composter runs safely and silently around the clock. When it’s looking full, simply remove the fertilizer and use it to feed your plants rich nutrients. The microbes can be reused cycle to cycle without needing replacement. Since the Reencle composter turns your food waste into fertilizer, it can be used to nurture any sort of living plant such as lawn, bushes, flowers, vegetable gardens, or potted plants. Compost can be a wonderful addition to regular fertilizer from the store, providing your plants with a balance of nutrients and food, and just in time for your spring gardening. By decreasing your food waste and promoting healthy growth of plants, you can make your own positive impact on the environment. Go greener with the Reencle Prime Food Waste Composter for only $479 ($699) through March 5 at 11:59pm Pacific, no coupon needed.
