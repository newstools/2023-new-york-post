NYPD detectives believe they are closing in on the “Hazmat killer” after finding the Tyvek suit the suspect was wearing when he gunned down a bodega clerk on Manhattan’s Upper East Side last week, police officials said Wednesday. Police found surveillance footage tracking the gunman clad in white coveralls fleeing Daona Gourmet Deli at East 81st Street and Third Avenue on Friday and heading into a Bronx public housing complex, Chief of Detectives James Essig said. “He’s seen going in there – the rear of it – on his vehicle on that scooter,” Essig said. “And when we went near the back, we found that Tyvek suit. So that’s actively being processed by crime scene (investigators).” Cops found the suit on Tuesday night behind a building at near East 158th Street and Park Avenue in The Bronx. They are still attempting to get a facial recognition match off the video, Essig said. “We’re still tracking the video,” he said. “Hopefully, we’ll have some good stuff shortly but the investigation continues. The suspect is wanted for three gunpoint robberies in the past 10 days, too — all of which he wore his strange get-up for, cops said. The slaying at Doana Gourmet Deli may have been a robbery gone bad, according to Chief Joseph Kenny. “In this case, as of right now, it appears that he took a tray full of lighters. No money was taken out of the register. No cigarettes were removed,” the assistant chief said. The NYPD is offering $10,000 for a tip that helps lead to the arrest of the gunman, police announced.
