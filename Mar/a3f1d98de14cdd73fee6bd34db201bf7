“I want more berries and that summer feelin!'” We agree with Mr. Harry Styles, and would like to add that the bright red berries also remind us of the start of spring, which is blooming as we speak. If you also associate strawberries with the start of spring and summer, may we suggest some farm-fresh fashions? Back again for another year, Coach has released a new strawberry collection, ripe for the picking. Available right now, head to the Coach Outlet site and shop the “Sweet Szn” collection, picking from rows of handbags, wallets, coin purses and more. Not a purse person? No worries, as the strawberry field is quite fruitful this season, spanning shoes, hair accessories and even juicy jewelry. As with the actual fruit, the strawberry bags and accessories won’t stay in stock for long, so we advise you to head to the site now and fill your basket with all the sweet strawberry finds now, using the matching red buttons below should you like our top picks of the season. Get a mini berry for your coins while not spending too many of them. This adorable mini bag is under $100 and may be the star of the strawberry show. We love to enjoy our baguette (bags) with berries. This trendy style is now covered in them, on a black background to make the red fruit pop. Sometimes all you need is one perfect berry. This classic Coach bag has just that, with a glittering gold C on the front. Adorable berries and pearls? We’re getting choked up.
