PORT ST. LUCIE — For Pete Alonso, Tuesday was about more than the Mets’ 8-4 Grapefruit League loss to the Astros in which the first baseman went hitless. Prior to the game at Clover Park, the first baseman helped bring awareness to K9s for Warriors, an organization that provides assistance for military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, or other issues. Alonso spent time on the field with Bear, a black Labrador retriever that is being trained to become a service dog thanks in part to a sponsorship by the Alonso Foundation. “It is so great to have Bear out at the ballpark and see his development,” Alonso said. “Service dogs like Bear literally change the lives of veterans.” The dog was named after Alonso’s nickname, Polar Bear. “We just want to get veterans the help they need for PTSD,’’ Alonso said. “It’s very important to me and my wife. “The fact that we can assist is truly inspiring.” Alonso introduced Mets fans to Bear in a January Instagram post, writing, “we are so proud of all the hard work he’s been putting in learning how to support a veteran in need.” Last season, the Mets helped sponsor and raise Shea, another Labrador retriever puppy who trained to be a service dog with America’s VetDogs. The canine was escorted around the park by trainers, greeting fans and hanging out on the grass at Citi Field during batting practice.
