A drunk student has been busted for allegedly peeing on a business-class passenger during a 15-hour flight from New York to India. Aryan Vohra, a 21-year-old Indian national studying in the US, was arrested in Delhi late Saturday as he stepped off American Airlines Flight AA 292 from JFK, according to Indian police and the airline. The pilot radioed ahead to warn of a “disruptive customer” who “was heavily intoxicated,” officials said. “He was repeatedly arguing with the operating crew, was not willing to be seated and continuously endangering the safety of crew and aircraft,” American Airlines told ANI news agency. “After disturbing the safety of fellow passengers, [he] finally urinated on a passenger,” the airline said. Vohra — who was traveling home for his sister’s wedding — later told cops that he’d tried to go to the bathroom but the door was locked, according to the Times of India. The peed-on passenger was not identified beyond the fact that it was a man in seat 15G, which is in business class. Vohra apologized and begged him not to file a complaint, which he appears to have gone along with, police said, noting the arrest followed a complaint filed by the airline, not the alleged soaked victim. Still, Vohra continued to “misbehave” after being led from the plane by security officials, Devesh Kumar Mahla, the airport’s deputy head of police, told ANI. Mahla vowed to take the “strongest possible action.” American Airlines also canceled his return flight to the Big Apple — and banned him from all its future flights. Vohra was released on bail Sunday as cops continue investigating. It was not immediately clear if he was also in business class on the Boeing 777, and the reports did not detail where he lives and studies in the US. ANI noted that it was similar to a case on Nov. 26 when a passenger urinated on a 70-year-old woman in business class of an Air India flight, this time heading from Delhi to New York.
