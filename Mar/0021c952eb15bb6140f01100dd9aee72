All dogs go to heaven — except for maybe these two. A Brazilian church service took a randy turn after two frisky pooches decided to make whoopee in the middle of the priest’s sermon. A video of the horndogs’ sacrilegious sex sesh is currently blowing up on Instagram. The scandalous scene occurred on Feb. 16 while Father Pierre Mauricio was presiding over a service at the Church of Santa Rita in the city of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, CEN reported. In the video, the minister is seen giving a sermon at an altar while two stray pups frolic about onstage. Little did the priest know that his talk was about to be interrupted by the dogs’ sex act. Mauricio starts speaking on the role of the church during the Carnival celebrations, when suddenly, as if on cue, one of the salacious canines mounts its companion. Mauricio puts his face in his palm as he comments on the wild scene transpiring before him. “They haven’t been baptized yet, it’s not possible,” the man of God quips, causing church-goers to chuckle. “What’s going on? Oh my God. Beloved Jesus.” He then chastises the Rex-hibitionists over their carnal congregation, saying, “My children, you can’t do that here. Go to the woods.” Mauricio subsequently posted a video of the canine canoodling to his 100,000 followers on Instagram, garnering many reactions from bemused commenters. “Things that only happen to Father Pierre,” said one fan, while another wrote, “God bless Father Pierre.” “Even the dogs have affection for the Lord,” quipped one Instagram commenter. “How beautiful, little angels! Adopt them, Father!” urged another, to which Father Pierre replied: “I’ve adopted them.” Pierre later posted a selfie in which he could be seen holding the two furry church crashers under his arm after changing out of his robes. This isn’t the first time tomfoolery has transpired at a house of God. In 2021, a New York City infant redefined “baby shower” after hilariously taking a whizz while getting baptized at a Greek church.
