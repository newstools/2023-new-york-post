The following is a list of the best parts of going to the movies, ranked: 4. Popcorn. 3. M&M’s, 2. Putting the M&M’s into the popcorn, and 1. how big the screen is.

But for too long, consumers have wondered how they might be able to capture some of that silver screen experience at home. Almost all of the pieces are there – you can buy popcorn and M&M’s for your home at any time – but one thing was missing. Sure, you can buy a large TV, but you’ll never get a picture as big as the movies. Until now.
