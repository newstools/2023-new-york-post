The historic Lucille Lortel Theatre has bought a three-story carriage house in Chelsea for around $5.35 million, sources say. The deal for the property, at 134 W. 18th St., has not hit public records; the exact price, for now, isn’t known. The carriage house will be the theater’s headquarters — as well as a 61-seat theater that will open in 2025. That’s in addition to its likewise historic — and renovated — Christopher Street theater. The 23-foot-wide carriage house is part of a row of erstwhile stables that were once used to service West Village gold coast mansions. The commercially zoned property, built around 1910, boasts a coveted curb cut and comes with high ceilings, but “needs a lot of work,” a source said. The property is just outside the Chelsea Historic District and also delivers a total buildable allowance of 12,738 square feet — but the so-called sliver law limits most narrow townhouses under 45 feet wide from building higher. The listing brokers are Matthew Lesser, Ravi Kantha, Cameron LeCates and Tori Landon of Leslie J. Garfield.
