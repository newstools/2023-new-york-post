The Rangers are 0-2 with Patrick Kane. Luckily, they are still in good shape in the standings and Kane now has practices under his belt with his new team as they begin a three-game road trip against the Canadiens Thursday night. To talk about Kane’s slow start, the Rangers’ power-play changes and everything Blueshirts, we bring you a new episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Mollie Walker, Larry Brooks and me. We are joined by ESPN NHL reporter Emily Kaplan.
