Nick Cannon already has a new “baby mama” in mind should he choose to welcome baby No. 13. The 42-year-old host was joined by “The Real Housewives of New York City” alum Luann de Lesseps, 57, on Wednesday’s episode of “The Masked Singer” as she provided the judges with clues to guess the identity of the masked performer Medusa. But before the cabaret singer could give her hints, Cannon told the audience that the duo “have a love thing going” — to which she replied, while caressing his shoulder, “We do, we do,” according to The Sun. Lesseps then joked to Cannon that she “wouldn’t tell — if he didn’t,” as judge Robin Thicke perfectly interjected, “We will all find out nine months later.” The remark both stunned and amused the fellow judges and live audience, the outlet reported. The Post has contacted reps for Cannon and de Lesseps for comment. Cannon and model Alyssa Scott welcomed their daughter, Halo Marie Cannon, in December after the duo’s infant son, Zen, lost his battle with brain cancer the prior year. Halo was Scott’s third child and Cannon’s 12th. The former Nickelodeon star welcomed son Legendary, daughter Onyx and son Rise with Bre Tiesi, Lanisha Cole and Brittany Bell, respectively. Cannon also shares son Golden and daughter Powerful with Bell, as well as two sets of twins — Monroe and Moroccan, 11, with Mariah Carey and Zion and Zillion, 1, with Abby De La Rosa. The latter also welcomed a third child with Cannon on Nov. 11, a baby girl named Beautiful Zeppelin Cannon. The now-notoriously fertile Cannon told “Entertainment Tonight” last week that “God decides” when he stops having kids. “God decides when we’re done, but I believe I definitely got my hands full,” he admitted to the outlet. “And I’m so focused. I’m locked in. But when I’m 85, you never know. I might [have more],” Cannon added.
