Michael Douglas revealed that his nearly 23-year marriage with Catherine Zeta-Jones is still hot and heavy — even on the green. The couple regularly play golf together, and they have their own special penalties to keep it spicy. “The rules are — I have to whip it out if I don’t hit it past the ladies’ tees, which I manage most of the time,” Douglas, 78, told the Guardian. “But there have been times when we’re playing alone, and have to give her a little show because we are competitive.” The “Basic Instinct” and “Ant-Man” legend then clarified: “But only when I play with my wife.” Zeta-Jones, 53, previously let their erotic rule slip during an appearance on “The Graham Norton Show.” “I’m pretty good, better than him, and we have a bet that if he ducks a shot, he has to drop his pants,” she said during the 2016 interview. The “Chicago” Oscar winner revealed that this is a bet she makes not just with her Oscar-winning husband — but with “any man” she plays against. “There has been an issue with paparazzi, so I make him go into the bushes. A deal is a deal,” Zeta-Jones quipped. Douglas and Zeta-Jones have been married since November 2000 and they share two children: Dylan, 22, and Carys, 19. Douglas has another son, Cameron, 44, from a previous marriage to Diandra Luker. The Hollywood stars often post romantic messages to each other on Instagram. Douglas shared a black-and-white photo of them on Valentine’s Day with the caption, “Happy Valentine’s Day to my darling Catherine! I love you so much.” In November, Zeta-Jones posted a sweet picture of them kissing in honor of their anniversary. “[Celebrating] 22 years and 1 day! It’s in the fine details … love you sweetheart. Happy Anniversary,” she wrote.
