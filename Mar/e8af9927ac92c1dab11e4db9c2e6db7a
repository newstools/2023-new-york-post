Dozens of companies, banks and law enforcement organizations were served with warrants in the University of Idaho quadruple homicide, but their contents have been sealed by a judge in the high-profile case for fear that they could potentially sway a jury, according to a report. The warrants, which were handed out to more than 60 companies — including AT&T, American Express, Bank of America, Apple, PayPal and Reddit — were ordered to remain sealed in the case against Bryan Kohberger, Fox News reported Saturday. The warrants “contain highly intimate facts or statements … which would be highly objectionable to a reasonable person,” the outlet said. The court also noted that “documents contain facts or statements that might threaten the safety of or endanger the life or safety of individuals.” Among the others served with warrants is the Moscow Police Department Forensic Lab and Ka-Bar Knives, as it was previously revealed cops were searching for a “Rambo”-style knife — such as a KA-BAR brand combat blade — used in the slayings. A brown leather knife sheath that featured “Ka-Bar,” “USMC” and the United States Marine Corps eagle globe and anchor insignia on it was found at the grisly crime scene. Kohberger, a 28-year-old criminology graduate student at nearby Washington State University, is accused of stabbing students Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, to death as they slept in their off-campus Moscow home on Nov. 13. He has been charged with four counts of homicide and one count of felony burglary in the brutal slaying. Kohberger’s next court appearance is scheduled for June. He is currently being held at the Latah County Jail, which is just around the corner from the rented home where the students lived. The King Road residence has been boarded up and is slated to be demolished.
