Hackers, stalkers, and scammers may want your phone number, but there are some simple things you can do to keep it from them. If you’re in a situation where your number is needed, whether it’s for work, dating, or selling something on Facebook Marketplace, giving out your phone number is something to be cautious about. Fortunately, you can hide your real phone number with a second phone line from Hushed. Use this app to make calls and send text messages safely and affordably. Through March 31, you can get this lifetime protection for just $24.99 (reg. $150). A Hushed private phone line is an easy way to protect your privacy. Choose from hundreds of US and Canada area codes, customize your voicemail, and set up call forwarding without any added fees. You’ll get 6,000 SMS messages and 1,000 phone minutes per year included, and you can upgrade to more if needed. Access all of your second number’s texts and phone calls with the Hushed app to keep everything separate from your personal number. With multiple subscriptions, you can manage all of them within one app if you want one for work and one for dating, selling online, or traveling.
