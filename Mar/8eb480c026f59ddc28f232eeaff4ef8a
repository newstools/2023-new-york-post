Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving were said to be best friends during their tenure with the Brooklyn Nets. But ever since the trades, which saw Durant get shipped to Phoenix and Irving to Dallas, the pair haven’t spoken. The 13-time All-Star pulled back the curtain on his relationship with Irving and the dramatic ending to their tenure in Brooklyn during an episode of “The ETCs with Kevin Durant” podcast this week. “We all move and do the things that we wanna do for our careers,” Durant said during the show. “I can’t fault somebody for doing that even though it might have been at our expense as a team … I don’t wanna act like I wasn’t upset that we didn’t finish the season, because I love playing with [Irving]. I wanted to see where we can go with that because we were both playing at a high level. “What [Irving] was doing behind the scenes, what his contract negotiations was, I don’t want to even think about none of that stuff. Whatever he is doing, that’s him … We haven’t had a conversation but eventually we will.” Irving has struck a similar tone when speaking about his former teammate. “I just am glad that [Durant] got out of there. . . . I’m just praying for his happiness, praying for his well-being,” Irving said after the Mavericks’ Feb. 8 win over the Clippers. Durant is making his Suns debut Wednesday against the Charlotte Hornets. The 34-year-old Durant suffered an MCL sprain on Jan. 8 and hasn’t appeared in a game since. Irving has played seven games since being traded to Dallas. The Mavericks have gone 3-4 during those contests. The Suns and Durant will visit Irving and the Mavericks on Sunday, March 5 at 1 p.m. ET on ABC.
