It’s been nearly two months since California last won a college basketball game, and it’s been over a year since the Golden Bears won a game on the road. Don’t expect either of those streaks to end Thursday in a tough spot for one of the nation’s worst teams. Cal’s issues started early in the year, when the team lost 12 straight games to open the season before tasting victory against UT Arlington in its final non-conference test. That win came without leading scorer Devin Askew (15.5 PPG), who has played just twice since that game and is out for the year with a hernia injury. Unsurprisingly, the Golden Bears’ offense has cratered as a result, ranking in the bottom 15 in the entire country in adjusted efficiency during the team’s current 13-game losing streak — with nine of those losses coming by double digits. That includes an embarrassing 29-point home loss to Oregon on Jan. 18, when Cal’s ND Okafor (10 points) led the team in scoring. Now the Golden Bears hit the road for a rematch with the Ducks, who are coming off a tough road win against rival Oregon State and have won four of their last five home games — including blowout wins over Arizona and USC. With Oregon still fighting for conference tournament seeding and an outside shot at an NCAA Tournament bid, I’d expect Dana Altman’s group to lay a second straight smackdown on the Pac-12 doormats.
