Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Thursday: In a 6-4 loss to Team Venezuela at Clover Park, big-armed righty reliever Bryce Montes de Oca struck out two in a clean inning in which he touched 101.1 mph. He cracked triple digits with his fastball three times. Jose Butto allowed five runs in two innings — including a pair of home runs to Jose Altuve — against his native country. Still, Butto came out having enjoyed the experience. “It was special. It was an honor to be able to face that team over there, especially with the lineup that they have,” said Butto, who was particularly thrilled to see Miguel Cabrera and Salvador Perez in the opposing dugout. Top prospects Ronnie Mauricio and Brett Baty continue to hit. Mauricio drilled an opposite-field double to left-center as one of his two hits, while Baty knocked an RBI single to center. Starling Marte is expected to debut Friday afternoon, at 1:10 p.m., against the Astros at Clover Park. The split-squad Mets will play a second game at 6:05 p.m. in Jupiter, Fla., against the Cardinals.
