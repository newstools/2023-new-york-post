A Boston commuter narrowly avoided a serious injury Wednesday when a 25-pound aluminum tile plummeted from the subway ceiling, shocking video shows. The woman can be seen walking toward the staircase of the Harvard station’s southbound platform around 4 p.m. after hopping off the city’s red line. The 10-foot tile plunged to the ground in a dusty crash, landing at the feet of the unidentified straphanger. Stunned, the commuter stands still as the poof of grim plumes around here. After another second of shock, she sidesteps the massive panel and continues up the stairs. The commuter, identified by 7News as Cianna Navarro, said the incident has left her nervous to travel on the subway. “Physically I’m fine, but I’m really shaken up,” she said. “I was just walking and the next thing I know, the ceiling is coming crashing down in front of me.” “It’s another layer of fear that’s added onto my commute, having to worry and look over my shoulder or look over my head. My life shouldn’t have to be put in danger for them to make necessary changes,” said Navarro. The panel could be as old as 45 years, according to MBTA’s Interim General Manager Jeff Gonneville. The tile — which was constructed “for aesthetics and to absorb noise” — had become corroded after water accumulated inside the panel insulation, he said Friday. The tile fell after the metal rivets holding it in place became too weak to hold up the 10-foot panel in place. The tile weighed roughly 25 pounds when it slammed before the commuter’s feet Wednesday thanks to the water build-up — it should have weighed about five pounds dry. Gonneville claims the panels did not raise suspicions during a 2021 safety inspection, but admitted the tiles were difficult to examine. “It’s actually very difficult to get up and actually physically be able to inspect the area,” the transit head said.
