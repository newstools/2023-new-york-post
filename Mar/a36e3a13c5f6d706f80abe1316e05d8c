Nick Gates will forever be remembered around the Giants as a tough guy who came back from a devastating leg injury. His time with the Giants came to an end on Monday, though, as the versatile offensive lineman agreed to a three-year deal with the rival Commanders for a maximum value of $18 million and $8 million in guaranteed, per NFL Network. The 27-year-old Gates stays in the NFC East and goes to a team that he has a history with — and not in a good way. He went down with a gruesome broken fibula and tibia against the Commanders early in the 2021 season, an injury that nearly ended his career. Gates needed seven surgeries to get the leg in working order and he was able to return to the field midway through the 2022 season. He started eight of the final nine games, mostly working at left guard in a rotation with Ben Bredeson, and was the starting left guard for both of the Giants’ playoff games. Gates was voted in as one of the team captains in 2022 and earned the respect of Brian Daboll, the first-year head coach. The Giants believe they have assembled depth on their offensive line but they do want to upgrade the interior of the line. Jon Feliciano, who started 15 games at center in his first year with the Giants after arriving from the Bills, is set to be an unrestricted free agent and the Giants have an interest in bringing him back. Follow the Post’s NFL Free Agency live coverage Gates has also been an NFL starter at center and could end up starting somewhere on the interior of the offensive line for the Commanders. The Giants will likely turn to Bredeson or Joshua Exeudu, a rookie third-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, as an option at left guard. They liked what they saw from Ezeudu before he landed on injured reserve with a neck issue.
