A couple of weeks ago, the Penn State Nittany Lions were all but out of contention for a NCAA Tournament bid. But after a hot week, they’re in the thick of the Big Ten championship race.

Gametime: 6:30 p.m. ET TV: Big Ten Network Live Stream: fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The Nittany Lions carry momentum, confidence and the strategy that makes sense. Penn State — winners of five of their past six games and reaching bubble status with back-to-back thrilling wins — holds a pair of double-digit wins over the underachieving Illini, thanks to star Jalen Pickett and elite perimeter shooting. Illinois, illogically, is adamant about beating Penn State at its own game, hoisting nearly as many 3-pointers in their meetings — and all season — despite ranking 333rd in the nation in shooting behind the arc.
