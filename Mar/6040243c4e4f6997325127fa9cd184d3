The man of many records in his legendary football career is still setting more 28 years later. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana’s jersey which he wore during two of his four Super Bowl victories sold for $1.2 million, the highest ever paid for a football jersey at auction. The jersey, through collectibles marketplace Goldin, beat out the previous record held by Tom Brady whose jersey sold for $480,000 in January 2022, according to NBC. Montana’s red No. 16 jersey was initially on the auction block for $250,000. Montana wore the jersey specifically during Super Bowl XIX, when he defeated Dan Marino’s Miami Dolphins in 1985, and against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII in 1989. The auction that shattered Brady’s record will be tacked on to a months-long auction of Montana’s personal items — one being his Super Bowl XXIV jersey which sold for $720,000. Montana’s Notre Dame jersey from when he threw for four touchdowns against USC in 1977 sold for $115,200. Montana also parted ways with the gold jacket he wore when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for $36,000. Even Montana’s earliest memorabilia hit the market. One bidder spent $36,000 on the jersey, blue with No. 13 ironed on, Montana wore at Ringgold High School in Pennsylvania. The proceeds and earnings from the auction will go to The Four Rings Montana Family Foundation to support local children’s charities, according to Sports Colors Digest. “I have been fortunate to have some incredible moments in my career, but these weren’t just individual moments. They were moments celebrated with an entire fanbase of people,” Montana said through Goldin. “I have amassed a lot of memorabilia over the course of my career, and I am excited to share these parts of my collection for fans to enjoy and continue to relive the memories, the Hall of Famer added.” Montana’s career 49ers stat-line boated 3,409 completions in 5,391 attempts for 40,551 yards and 273 touchdowns. The 49ers quarterback would ultimately be traded before the 1993 season, playing his last two seasons for the Kansas City Chiefs. Montana ranks fourth in career passing yards (40,551 yards), attempts (5,391), and passing touchdowns (273), according to Pro Football Hall of Fame.
