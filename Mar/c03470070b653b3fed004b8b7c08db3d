Payday came early for these supermarket coworkers. Tyesha Trice and Dylan Mitchell won $50,000 after they decided to split two scratch-off tickets during their lunch break, the Kentucky Lottery announced Tuesday. The duo — both cashiers at a Louisville Valu Mart — had no expectations when they bought the tickets. “We were just messing around and decided to play,” Trice said. After finding that they won $100 off a $30 ticket, they decided to push their luck a little further and try for a $50 500X ticket. Trice and Mitchell were happy enough after scratching off the ticket’s first spot to reveal a $500 win, but the momentum continued to build. “I saw the second one and thought I was going to pass out,” Trice said. The players hit a win on every spot on the ticket, meaning their winnings totaled $50,000. They cashed in the next day, which happened to be Mitchell’s birthday. “I’ll never forget it,” Mitchell said. “Definitely, a birthday to remember.” After taxes, Trice and Mitchell each took home $17,875. Mitchell said he plans to use his birthday winnings to buy himself a car and find housing. Trice wants to use her share for rent and her savings. Their employer, Valu Mart, was also awarded $500 for selling the winning ticket.
