Prolific author Margaret Atwood did not mince words when talking about Prince Harry. In a new interview with the Times, “The Handmaid’s Tale” author noted that the Duke of Sussex was lucky to be born into today’s royal family. If the 38-year-old had been part of a more powerful clan, he “would have been murdered by somebody lower down the food chain to get him out of the way,” the 83-year-old told the publication, which noted that she is a fan of “Game of Thrones.” The remark sparked some backlash on Twitter, with one person posting, according to the Mirror, “Words fail me. What an utterly ridiculous comment to make.” The comment comes on the heels of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex being told to “vacate” Frogmore Cottage and the couple seeing their US approval rating plunge after a cheeky “South Park” episode scoffed at their privacy claims. Harry recently published a 400-page memoir in January entitled “Spare,” in which he detailed his life as a member of the royal family and his feelings about being the second son of King Charles and the late Princess Diana. Harry recently had an online chat with Dr. Gabor Maté about his book. “I certainly don’t see myself as a victim,” the father of two said during the interview. “I’m really grateful to be able to share my story in the hopes that it will help, empower, encourage others and, hopefully, let people understand — again back to the human experience — [that] we are in some shape and form all connected, especially through trauma,” he added.
