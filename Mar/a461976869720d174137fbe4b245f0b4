A far-left Brooklyn pol is pushing “delusional” legislation that would prohibit landlords statewide from refusing to rent to people with criminal records — even murderers, critics say. The bill, introduced by Democratic Socialist state Sen. Julia Salazar, would provide equity to ex-cons and others with “criminal legal system involvement” by protecting them from being discriminated against when seeking housing. The legislation claims criminal history “is often used” as an alternative means to wrongly reject people of color from getting apartments, considering the legal system “disproportionately impacts” them compared to whites. It doesn’t contain any language exempting people convicted of serious crimes. State Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay told The Post Salazar’s bill is the latest on an “ever-growing list of delusional Democratic ideas designed to help lawbreakers and strip law-abiding citizens of their basic rights.” “Small landlords who rent their property should determine the criteria for prospective tenants — not be forced to ridiculous terms dictated by Albany’s socialist, cancel-rent crowd,” fumed Barclay (R-Fulton). Salazar defended the measure, saying “people … need a place to live after they’re released from jail or prison.” “It is objectively bad for public safety if they are homeless,” she added. Salazar also came under fire on Twitter Thursday after referring to the bill as the” HERO Act, an acronym for Housing for an Equitable Reentry and Opportunity Act. Salazar’s legislation is similar to a controversial bill introduced last August by Councilman Keith Powers (D-Manhattan). That bill specially prohibits Big Apple landlords from performing criminal background checks on prospective tenants – even those convicted of murder and other heinous crimes.
