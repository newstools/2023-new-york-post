We’re here to sort of “Make Your Dreams Come True.” In 2023, Daryl Hall and John Oates are going on tour — just not together. From May 24 through June 9, Daryl Hall and the Daryl’s House Band are taking off on an eight-concert tour that includes stops in Montclair, NJ on May 24, Port Chester, NY on June 7 and Atlantic City, NJ on June 9. His bandmate, John Oates will play five spring shows in California, Nashville and Chicago from April 13 through May 25. At the time of publication, none of Oates’ shows are scheduled to take place in the Northeast. No word on whether either Rock and Roll Hall of Famer will appear at each other’s shows either. With that being said, if you want to see half of Hall and Oates — Hall or Oates — here’s everything you need to know. A complete calendar including all tour dates and venues for Hall’s eight 2023 concerts can be found below. A complete calendar of all John Oates tour dates is listed below. Hall went old school in 2022 and dropped the rare double album. “Before After,” comprised of 30 tracks, features Hall’s signature classic sound — the indefinable center between pop and rock. If you want to hear the double album in its entirety, you can find “Before After” here. Last year, Oates dropped just one song — the sensual single “Pushin’ A Rock” that sounds like it could fit in a playlist next to “She’s Gone,” “Maneater” and “Rich Girl.” In 2023, Oates went a bit more downtempo. Thus far in this young year, he’s released just one song, the ballad “Disconnected.” You can hear both songs here.
