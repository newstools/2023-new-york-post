Do you have “regerts?” A dedicated tattoo removal parlor, Removery, has leased 2,500 square feet on the ground floor of 4 W. 21st St. for a city flagship. Kenneth Hochhauser of Winick Realty Group repped the newly minted tenant, which has seen extraordinary growth in the service while reducing the stigma of tattoo removal. Removery is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and only uses lasers that break down the ink without breaking the skin — allowing the body to absorb the ink naturally and pass it through. Paul Singer’s Elliott Investments pumped $50 million into the company in 2021. At that time, Removery acquired Clean Slate Laser — which was the industry leader in the competitive tri-state metropolitan market. Removery currently has three other locations in Manhattan, three in Brooklyn and one on Staten Island — as well as others in surrounding areas. The company expects to have nearly 250 locations by 2025. Through its INK-nitiative program and partnering with various non-profits, Removery provides free tattoo removal from the hands, necks or faces of those who were formerly incarcerated, ex-gang members, human-trafficked, domestically abused or have a hate speech tattoo. It also provides the free removal of radiation tattoos, which can be a byproduct of oncology treatments. The upper floors have 56 loft co-ops in a residential building developed by the Brodsky Organization on a 99-year ground lease it signed in 2000 with BREM Realty. The project was designed by architect Hugh Hardy. Ivan Hakimian and his partner, Igal Namdar, then master-leased the retail space from Brodsky. In the deal with Removery, the owners were represented by Ike Bibi and Carolina Aziz of Kassin Sabbah Realty — and had an asking rent of $22,000 per month.
