US intelligence agencies cannot link a foreign adversary to any of the incidents associated with so-called “Havana syndrome,” the hundreds of cases of brain injuries and other symptoms reported by American personnel around the world. The findings released Wednesday by US intelligence officials cast doubt on the longstanding suspicions of many people who reported theories that Russia or another country may have been running a global campaign to harass or attack Americans using some form of directed energy. Instead, officials say, there is more evidence that foreign countries were not involved. In some cases, the US detected among adversarial governments confusion about the allegations and suspicions that “Havana syndrome” was an American plot. Two officials familiar with the assessment briefed reporters Wednesday on condition of anonymity, under ground rules set by the US Director of National Intelligence. Investigators reviewed roughly 1,500 cases in 96 countries. In some instances, personnel who were part of the investigation were on the ground in places while new reports of possible Havana syndrome cases came in. Seven US agencies participated in a multi-year investigation.
