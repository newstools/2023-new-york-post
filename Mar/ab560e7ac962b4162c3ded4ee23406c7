With the 2023 MLB season rapidly approaching, there’s no better way to get ready for Opening Day than heading on down to Tampa’s annual Innings Festival. Held March 18-19 at the Raymond James Stadium, the two-day extravaganza boasts an impressive roster of rockers and former MLBers to entertain fans of all ages. Just a few of the musical acts on hand this year include Dave Matthews Band, Weezer, Imagine Dragons, Pitbull and The Avett Brothers. For those interested in meeting MLB legends, John Kruk, Goose Gossage, Wade Boggs, Cecil Fielder, Rafael Furcal and many more will be on hand to chop it up. Sounds like the perfect weekend. And better yet, you don’t need a Yankees-like budget to attend. At the time of publication, we found some two-day general admission passes going for as low as $167 before fees on Vivid Seats. Single-day passes for both Saturday and Sunday start at $107 before fees. All prices are subject to fluctuation. Want to see everyone who made the cut this year? You can take a peek at the entire lineup for this year’s Innings Festival below. Although no other concert will have quite as much baseball as this year’s Innings Festival, here are five that we think might be right up your alley these next few months. • Guns N’ Roses • Blink-182 • Chris Stapleton • Goo Goo Dolls • Matchbox Twenty Looking for other options?
