Investor and president of clean energy company Future Environmental Inc., Steven Lempera, is selling his Miami Beach perch for $7.89 million, The Post has learned, making that a record sum fetched for a non-penthouse unit. His company Future Environmental focuses on effective waste management solutions. The three-bedroom, five-bathroom residence at the luxe Portofino Tower listed on Feb. 21 before landing a buyer just two weeks later. Occupying roughly 4,800 square feet, the unit comes fully furnished by Italian brand Visionnaire. There are four terraces and a flow-through plan, the listing notes. The primary bedroom is a glass hexagon and comes with a walk-in closet with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, a 90 inch movie screen and a floating tub above the ocean. Features include a kitchen with waterfront views — plus upscale Miele and Viking appliances — marble tubs, Manooi chandeliers, a wet bar with Rolls-Royce-style ceiling lighting, and Creston controls and security cameras, the listing notes. Lempera purchased the unit in 2017 for $2.88 million; he’ll be walking away with one hefty profit. Eddy Martinez and Roland Ortiz with Worldwide Group at ONE Sotheby’s International Realty held the listing. In 2019, when the Florida market was struggling, Lempera snagged a sprawling home in Coral Gables in an online auction for $27.8 million — a fraction of what it was worth. He flipped the home in 2020 for more than $40 million.
