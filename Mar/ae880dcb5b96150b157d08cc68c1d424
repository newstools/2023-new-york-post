A Virginia homeowner shot a naked woman in the leg after she allegedly broke into his home and attacked him with a frying pan, according to authorities. Carroll County Sheriff’s Office deputies initially responded to reports of a shooting on Loafers Rest Road in Austinsville on Feb. 26 and located Paula Michelle Locklear, 35, with a gunshot wound to the leg. “During the course of the investigation, deputies determined that the shooting was the result of a breaking and entering,” the sheriff’s office said in a Sunday Facebook post. “The homeowner, who heard a noise at the rear area of the home, went to the kitchen and observed an unclothed female, who was unknown to the homeowner, coming into the rear door at which time [she] began hitting the homeowner with a cast iron fry pan in the head.” The victim was eventually able to kick Locklear out of his home and secure his door. Locklear then allegedly went on the homeowner’s back porch and “began turning all the electrical breakers off to the home and started beating on the kitchen window,” the sheriff’s office said. She yelled at the victim to “get out of her house or she was going to kill him,” and began beating on the victim’s door, at which point he discharged a firearm and shot Locklear in the leg, according to authorities. Virginia officials charged Locklear with felony breaking and entering while armed; assault and battery; and property damage. The 35-year-old suspect is being held without bond pending her arraignment in the Carroll County General District Court. The homeowner is not facing any charges after the Carroll County Commonwealth Attorney Roger Brooks determined that he was acting in self-defense.
