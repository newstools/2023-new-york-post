Watch out, Americans! If you dare expose the federal government’s lies on COVID and its collusion with tech giants on Russiagate and Hunter’s laptop, Big Brother will come after you. Witness the brazenly political targeting of Twitter CEO Elon Musk by the Federal Trade Commission. Ahead of a Thursday hearing, the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government revealed that the FTC under uber-leftist chair Lina Khan has been after Musk since he acquired Twitter in October. And Khan doubled down after Musk began to pull back the veil via the Twitter Files — a deep dive into the shenanigans of Twitter’s previous management and (crucially) its coziness with the feds. The agency’s not only sent letter after letter digging into Twitter’s layoffs, it’s also demanding all internal communications by, from or about Musk — and telling him to name reporters he’s shared info with. Pure Orwell. How is any of that the agency’s business? Sure, the flamboyant entrepreneur overpaid for the company. And yes, his outspokenness and bumpy management style may have added to the headwinds it now faces. None of those concern the FTC in the slightest, however. Its mandate is to protect consumers. And there’s zero indication his decisions are doing Twitter users any harm. (Anyway, it’s free.) No, it’s all a naked scare tactic aimed at Musk, and by extension the media iconoclasts who’ve helped get at truths long hidden on COVID, the 2020 election and other crucial issues. Of course, Khan’s reckless disregard for the rule of law has characterized her term as FTC chair (along with deep employee discontent and a series of embarrassing court slapdowns). House GOPers Jim Jordan (OH) and Nancy Mace (SC) say they’ll demand Khan testify on her Twitter offensive soon. It should happen now. The FTC shouldn’t be waging war on companies that simply happen to annoy its chairwoman  — let alone demanding to know what reporters anyone talks to.
