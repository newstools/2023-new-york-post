The rubber match of this battle comes after two meetings decided by a total of five points, with neither team topping 63 points in either contest. Dayton, which committed a total of 35 turnovers against the Rams, ranks 245th in the nation in taking care of the basketball, and VCU turns teams over — led by Defensive Player of the Year Adrian Baldwin Jr. — as well as almost any team in the country.
