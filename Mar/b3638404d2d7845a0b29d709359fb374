Police are investigating an incident in which shots were allegedly fired from Bengals running back Joe Mixon’s house at high schoolers. A neighbor of Mixon’s told Fox19 in Cincinnati that shots were fired from the home at a group of teens who were playing with NERF guns outside of a house next door. It is not known who fired the weapon from Mixon’s house. One juvenile was transported to the hospital with undisclosed, non-life-threatening injuries. Mixon’s sister, Shelonda, told WLWT in Cincinnati that the Bengals running back was not involved in the shooting. Hamilton County Sheriff’s Deputies entered Mixon’s home early Tuesday morning. Several hours later, police left the home, crime scene tape was removed and no arrest was made in the incident. A representative for Mixon did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Post into the matter. Earlier this offseason, a warrant was issued for Mixon’s arrest after he was accused of pointing a gun at a woman in Cincinnati. The warrant was ultimately dismissed. The 26-year-old Mixon carried the ball 210 times for 814 yards and seven touchdowns this past season; he also had 60 receptions for 441 yards and two touchdowns. The Bengals have been noncommittal as to whether they will bring Mixon back for a seventh season with the team in 2023. “Joe has been a vital part of our team, He’s been a successful part of our team,” Bengals director of pro personnel Duke Tobin told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine last week. “Again, I’m not gonna predict the offseason because I don’t have the answers.” He continued the ambiguity with an allusion to “The Office.” “In the words of the great Kevin Malone,” Tobin said. “‘I don’t know.’”
