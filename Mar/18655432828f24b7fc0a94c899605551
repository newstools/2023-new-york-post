A case was there to be made for the Giants to move on from Jamie Gillan as their punter after one year with the team. The Giants do not see the 25-year old as a finished product, though, and on Monday made official his return. Gillan received a two-year contract worth $4 million. The strong-legged left-footer, called the Scottish Hammer — yes, he’s from Scotland and can hammer the ball — did enough in 2022 to convince general manager Joe Schoen, head coach Brian Daboll and special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey that he should stay. Gillan also serves as the holder on field goals and this ensures continuity with Graham Gano, one of the best kickers in the league. That continuity should continue with the return of long snapper Casey Kreiter, who is also expected to be re-signed. The Giants took a shot on Gillan after he spent his first three NFL seasons with the Browns. Gillan struggled with consistency as he finished with a career-high gross punting average of 46.8 yards — only 19th in the league. His net punting average of 40.2 yards was 26th in the NFL. Gillan had 26 punts inside the 20-yard line (15th in the league). He needs more work on his touch, as his nine touchbacks — he had a total of eight in his first three years in Cleveland — were the second-highest of any punter in 2022. Gillan did show considerable improvement in the second half of the season, signs of progress that encouraged the Giants to bring him back.
