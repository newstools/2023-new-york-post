A proposed Oregon bill would provide the deep blue state’s homeless population $1,000 per month that recipients could use at their own discretion. The bill, introduced last month, would establish a People’s Housing Assistance Fund Demonstration Program to give 12 monthly thousand-dollar payments to those suffering from homelessness or who are on the brink of becoming homeless. “Payments may be used for rent, emergency expenses, food, child care or other goods or services of the participant’s choosing,” the bill states. People who spend more than 50 percent of their monthly household income on rent, and those who earn 60% or less of the area median income would also be eligible for the funding. The legislation would also require the Portland State University Homelessness Research and Action Collaborative to study how effective the long-term cash assistance program would be across different demographics and household populations, as well as consider other circumstantial elements, such as domestic violence. The program would last until January 2026, at which time the study would be due for presentation, the bill states. Neither state Sen. Wlnsvey Campos or state Rep. Khanh Pham, the proposed bill’s sponsors, immediately responded to The Post’s request for comment. As many as 14,650 people are experiencing homelessness in Oregon, data shows. The state has been experiencing a long-lasting homeless issue for several years, especially in areas like Portland where up to 700 tent camps have taken over sections of the city. The state has also been dealing with increased drug use and trafficking after it passed a law decriminalizing street drugs last year. The state Health Authority ruled that the legislation had “failed” just seven months after it went into effect.
