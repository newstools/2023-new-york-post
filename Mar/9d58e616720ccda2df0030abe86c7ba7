The wait is over. The madness can officially begin. Selection Sunday is here and the March Madness 2023 field has been revealed. Kansas, the No. 1 seed in the West region, will be looking to become the first team to repeat as national champions since the Florida Gators won in 2006 and ’07. That Florida squad featured future NBA players Al Horford, Joakim Noah, Taurean Green, Corey Brewer and Chris Richard. If accomplished, it will be the Jayhawks’ seventh title win in program history and their third under head coach Bill Self in his 20th season. 2023 PRINTABLE BLANK NCAA TOURNAMENT BRACKET 2023 PRINTABLE BRACKET AFTER 68-TEAM REVEAL The other No. 1 seeds are Alabama, Houston and Purdue. The First Four battles will take place on March 14 and 15 in Dayton, which will determine the four teams who will advance to the 64-team bracket. The First Four will feature Texas A&M-Corpus Christi vs. Southeast Missouri State in the South, Mississippi State vs. Pittsburgh in the Midwest, Arizona State vs. Nevada in the West and Texas Southern vs. Fairleigh Dickinson in the East. The first round will commence on March 16, and will take place in various arenas across the country. The Final Four is set for April 1 in Houston, where the 2023 national champion will be crowned two days later. As with every March Madness tournament, we can expect just that – madness. Last year notably was the Cinderella story of Saint Peter’s University. The Peacocks became the darlings of the Big Dance as they battled their way to the Elite Eight, stunning Kentucky, Murray State and Purdue before falling to North Carolina. Who will be this year’s Cinderella? That’s for you to figure out in your bracket. Good luck!
