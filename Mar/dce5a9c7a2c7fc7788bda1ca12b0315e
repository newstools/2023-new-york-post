After a trade that reworked the Phoenix Suns’ roster in the hopes of forming an NBA Championship team, the team will finally see how they look with Kevin Durant. Durant’s much-anticipated debut for the Suns comes on Wednesday as the team faces the LaMelo Ball-less Hornets in Charlotte. Based on his odds, sportsbooks are unsure whether Durant will be fully integrated into the offense as he returns from an MCL injury suffered with the Nets. Below, we break down Kevin Durant’s Phoenix Suns debut, which will tip-off at 7 p.m. ET.  Just looking at these numbers is staggering; This is Kevin Durant we are talking about here. There must be extremely extenuating circumstances leading to his 3-point prop coming in at plus money for just two threes made. The books may be overcompensating because he is returning from an injury that sidelined him for seven weeks. The Suns should be able to get Durant open at will; they have the sixth-best 3-point shooting percentage in the NBA. Playing alongside Chris Pual and Devin Booker, this could be the best scoring we see from Durant in his NBA career. Bet on it to start early and often as a member of the Suns. Speaking of Booker, this is a phenomenal spot for the sharp-shooting two-guard. As a result of the Durant acquisition, Booker will need to become an elite distributor. But the thing is, he is already an excellent passer. Booker averages 11.3 potential assists per game, the 25th-most in the NBA. The addition of Durant should pump those numbers way up. Booker averaged 6.3 assists per game in the month of February and he is over this number in three straight games. If you are looking for a bit more juice for your Wednesday evening, 8+ assists is +390 on FanDuel, and 10+ is +1000. The Suns will be unleashing Booker the distributor now that they have Durant. Regardless of whether he hits these numbers Wednesday night, this is a prop to target in for the remainder of the regular season.
