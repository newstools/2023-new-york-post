Good riddance to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the first incumbent to get the boot in the Windy City in four decades. But the city could be in for worse! Lightfoot combined the worst excesses of Chicago’s old-school machine politics with hard-left policy prescriptions, especially on crime. The result? A resounding rebuke from the city’s voters, sick of skyrocketing violence — in 2021, murders hit a 25-year high; violent crime is overall up by 40% under her leadership — and Lightfoot’s naked contempt (she once told an alderman worried over George Floyd riots he was “100% full of s–t.”) Lightfoot refuses to draw the obvious conclusion, absurdly blaming her defeat on racism. Asked if she’d gotten unfair treatment, she replied: “I’m a black woman in America. Of course.” That’s today’s Democratic lefties: in denial over the simple fact that everyday citizens want safe streets, good schools and quality jobs, regardless of race or gender. And one of the two successful runoff candidates, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, is black — though arguably farther to the left than Lightfoot is. He’s a full-on  police defunder and darling of Chicago’s teachers union (so radical and selfish it makes New York City’s United Federation of Teachers look almost nice). But Paul Vallas, the other Dem heading to the runoff, seems serious about getting the city’s massive problems under control. For Chicago’s sake, hope voters fully reject the left and cast their ballots for sanity in April.
