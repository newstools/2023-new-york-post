TAMPA — The Yankees’ recent injury woes extend beyond their pitching staff. Harrison Bader underwent testing Thursday after experiencing left oblique discomfort from a swing he took in his last at-bat of Wednesday’s game, manager Aaron Boone said. The Yankees said they would have more information on the center fielder’s status Friday. Bader was originally scheduled to play on Thursday against the Red Sox, but the oblique issue changed those plans on a day when GM Brian Cashman announced that pitchers Carlos Rodon, Lou Trivino and Tommy Kahnle will all start the season on the injured list. It’s possible Bader could join them in that group depending on the results of Thursday’s testing. “Any time it’s the side [it’s concerning],” Boone said. “So we’ll see. But yeah, you don’t like to see that.” Asked who could fill in in center field if Bader is forced to miss time, Boone mentioned Aaron Hicks, Rafael Ortega, Estevan Florial and Aaron Judge. Ortega, a left-handed hitting non-roster invitee, started in center field for Bader on Thursday and went 0-for-1 with a walk. Hicks is already competing for the left-field job while Florial is out of minor league options, meaning if he does not make the 26-man roster, he would be exposed to waivers. Judge, meanwhile, spent the past two days adding left field to his toolbox — though he hardly saw any action again Thursday — after starting 74 games in center and 54 games in right last season.
