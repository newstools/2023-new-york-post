It was a glamorous night out for Joe Burrow and his longtime girlfriend, Olivia Holzmacher, who attended the weekend wedding of the Bengals quarterback’s former Ohio State teammate, free-agent Justin Hilliard. In a cozy photo shared Sunday on Holzmacher’s Instagram page, the couple — who has been linked since 2017 — can be seen dressed in formal attire for Saturday’s reception. Burrow attended Ohio State from 2015 to 2017 before transferring to LSU. The quarterback, now 26, won the 2019 national championship for the Tigers and was selected first overall by the Bengals in the 2020 NFL Draft. As for Hilliard, 25, he signed with the 49ers in May 2021 as an undrafted free agent before being waived by the team three months later. The Giants claimed Hilliard off of waivers in September of that year and placed him on injured reserve in October 2021. He was waived by the Giants in July 2022 and signed with the Chiefs’ practice squad in December. Hilliard was waived by Kansas City days later in January 2023. It was the Chiefs who spoiled the Bengals’ hopes of Super Bowl redemption when Kansas City topped Cincinnati in this year’s AFC Championship game, 23-20. Holzmacher supported Burrow during the Bengals’ playoff run this season, including Cincinnati’s Divisional Round win over the Bills in Buffalo. Burrow, who is entering his fourth year in the league, could be gearing up for a lucrative offseason. In January, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported how the Bengals are looking to ink Burrow to an extension. Burrow threw for 4,475 yards through 16 regular-season games in 2022, along with a career-high of 35 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.
