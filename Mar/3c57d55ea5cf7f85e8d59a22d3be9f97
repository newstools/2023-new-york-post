Conceptual artist Jennifer Rubell, daughter of top art collectors Donald and Mera Rubell — and the niece of the late Studio 54 co-founder Steve Rubell — has just bought an Upper East Side co-op for $5.7 million, according to city property records. The full-floor spread is at 139 E. 79th St. The unit first hit the market last year, asking $6.25 million — and was last listed for $5.99 million. The purchase comes a year after Rubell sold her $3.6 million Long Island home, Gimme Shelter previously reported. She also owns a co-op on Gramercy Park North. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom co-op on East 79th Street was formerly the home of the late author and New Yorker columnist Ved Mehta and his widow, Linn Cary Mehta, who lived there for decades. The elegant unit comes with a private elevator landing that opens to a large gallery, which leads to a living room with a woodburning fireplace and a library. There’s also a dining room and a pantry that connects to the kitchen. Original details include hardwood floors and oversize windows. The listing broker was Kathy Sloane, of Brown Harris Stevens.
