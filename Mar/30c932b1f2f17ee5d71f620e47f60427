Bronny James is finally a a 5-star recruit according to the On3’s basketball recruit rankings. The upgrade comes less than 24 hours after Lebron James tweeted that his son is “definitely better than some of these cats I’ve been watching on league pass today.” Tuesday afternoon, James’ stock skyrocketed: he now has a 98 score and is the No. 2-ranked combo guard and ninth-ranked nationally by On3. The 6-foot-3, 190-pound prospect has offers from several blue blood programs around the country. According to The Oregonian, James has lowered his options to a “top five or six” including Oregon, Ohio State, and USC, with the Buckeyes the overwhelming favorite to land his services. Thus far, On3 is the only outlet to give James a five-star rating. He remains a four-star for 247 Sports, ESPN and Rivals — each having him as the eighth-best guard in the class. Those sites can potentially move their rankings up as the high school basketball season nears its end. On3’s Jamie Shaw had plenty to say about the strides James has made throughout his high school career. “Even with the brightest of spotlights on him, Bronny continues to grow in his game,” Shaw said of Bronny’s 18-spot jump. “He entered Sierra Canyon as a freshman and arguably as the most famous high schooler in sports. “This fame has followed him, and even continued to grow. But so has Bronny’s game.” The younger James made plenty of noise during Sierra Canyon’s playoff run, pacing his team with 21 points un a 61-55 win over Etiwanda in the CIF Southern California Regional Division 1 playoffs last week. That performance also drew some attention from his NBA superstar dad. “Bronny you were SPECIAL tonight kid!!” the Lakers star tweeted. “Keep going!” Although Bronny’s pre-professional career has not been viewed in the same spotlight as his father’s —  he is still heir to the James throne — and the shoes to fill are huge.
