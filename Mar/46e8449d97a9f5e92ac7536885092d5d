Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Thursday: Max Scherzer recorded nine outs, all via the strikeout, in a 2-0 loss Wednesday to Team Nicaragua at Clover Park. In three-plus innings, during which he stretched out to 68 pitches, Scherzer allowed one hit, a home run by Cheslor Cuthbert. The Mets were no-hit until there were two outs in the bottom of the seventh, when Ronnie Mauricio reached on an infield single. Want to catch a game? The Mets schedule with links to buy tickets can be found here.  The Mets committed three errors in the first four innings. Mark Vientos, playing first, booted a grounder before shortstop Luis Guillorme could not cleanly field what might have been a double-play ball. In the fourth inning, catcher Francisco Alvarez tried to nab a base-stealer at second base but threw into center field. Jose Butto, a Venezuela native, will get the start in an exhibition against Team Venezuela at 1:10 p.m. in Port St. Lucie.
