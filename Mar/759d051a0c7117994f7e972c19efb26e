She’s got a lot of baggage. A flabbergasted flyer says Delta accidentally sent her 13 new suitcases after she complained that the carrier had “destroyed” her original bag. Gisele Rochefort took to TikTok to share the suitcase caper last week, claiming that the airline accidentally overcompensated by sending her an extra 12 pieces of new luggage. “Delta destroyed my suitcase,” Rochefort wrote in the clip, which has clocked up more than 1.1 million views online. An accompanying screenshot showed the suitcase in question, which sports a large crack in the side. “I filed a claim, they agreed to replace it,” the disgruntled traveler continued. Little did the frequent flyer know that Delta would be paying her back more than tenfold. “I got a notification that I had received some packages,” Rochefort subsequently stated, sharing a snap that showed 10 boxes stacked up in her hallway, which resembled a Home Depot warehouse. The clip then cut to a photo of even more boxes in the back of her truck, as well as extra crammed into the inside of the vehicle. Rochefort then unboxed her bounty of compensatory cases courtesy of Delta. “13 Ricardo Beverly Hills bags later … I think they made a mistake,” she wrote. Either way, TikTok had a field day with her rollaway-filled reimbursement, with one bemused viewer writing: “A win is a win.” “I don’t see a mistake,” joked another commenter. “I think I know what everyone is getting for their birthday or the holidays,” quipped a third fan. One person postulated that the surplus was due to “a computer glitch that showed it didn’t go through so they tried again and again.” Other gawkers joked that Delta was simply insuring Rochefort against future baggage mishaps. “Maybe they’re just prepaying for the next time they damage your bag,” theorized one follower. The Post has reached out to Delta for comment.
