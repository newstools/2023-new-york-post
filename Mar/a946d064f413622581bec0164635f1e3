A Florida fisherman got a gory surprise when he found what looked like a human hand resting at the bottom of a canal. When deputies from the Lee County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the Matlacha waters and retrieved the item, they discovered the lost limb belonged to a mannequin. Cpl. Jay Brett was able to secure a mini barge in order to capture the artificial appendage, according to Facebook. “We are ready for every matter at hand,” officials quipped alongside a picture of the fake white hand, which was missing a pinky finger. “It looks real, yeah, if you see it laying in the water,” David Marsch told NBC-2. Marsch said Hurricane Ian, which ravaged the state in September, could be to blame. “I’m sure with the hurricane, you’re finding a lot of different stuff in these canals,” Dan Gabriel. “And God still knows what’s under the water.”
