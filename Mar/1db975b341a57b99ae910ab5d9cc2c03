Police surrounded the home of Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon after deputies responded to reports of shots fired in the area late Monday night, Fox 19 Now reported. No arrests were made and the scene has since been cleared. Mixon’s involvement in the incident is still unknown. The shooting was reported around 8:30 p.m. in Anderson Township, an area about 13 miles southeast of downtown Cincinnati. The outlet reported that police confirmed a juvenile was taken to a hospital with “minor injuries.” The running back’s sister, Shalonda Mixon, says that Mixon was not involved in the shooting of the juvenile, WLWT News 5 in Cincinnati reported. Crime scene tape was stretched across two houses, one of which was Mixon’s home, the outlet confirmed through court documents, and one piece of evidence was marked in the home’s yard while deputies were investigating the scene. Deputies from Hamilton County Sheriff’s department were seen banging on Mixon’s door around 11:30 p.m. to identify themselves and were giving commands for the homeowner to come out. At 12:15 a.m., police allowed a car to drive up the home’s driveway. Police were then seen entering Mixon’s home at around 1:40 a.m., the outlet reported. At around 3:30 a.m., deputies were seen taking down the crime scene tape and began leaving the scene. They confirmed that one person was in the house, Fox 19 Now reported. Mixon, 26, was drafted out of the University of Oklahoma by the Cinincianti Bengals in the second round of the 2017 draft. He is going into the third year of his four-year, $48 million contract with the Bengals. On Jan. 21, 2023, the NFL star had an arrest warrant out for one count of aggravated menacing after he was accused of pointing a gun at a woman in Cincinnati. That warrant has since been dismissed. In 2017, Mixon reached a civil settlement with a woman that he punched in the face as a recruit at Oklahoma. Mixon was suspended for the entire 2014 college season as a result of the incident.
