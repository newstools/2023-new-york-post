Larsa Pippen is kissing and telling. In a new clip teasing the three-part reunion of her hit series, the “Real Housewives of Miami,” the ex-wife of NBA legend Scottie Pippen spoke candidly about her private life, just weeks after confirming her romance with Marcus Jordan, the 32-year-old son of Pippen’s former Bulls teammate, Michael Jordan. “I’ve always had sex like four times a night,” Larsa, 48, said moments after host Andy Cohen asked the cast, “Who here do you think has the most sex?” The conversation then veered toward Larsa’s burgeoning relationship with Jordan as Cohen addressed a fan who remarked, “Marcus is closer in age to your [22-year-old] son Scotty Jr. than to you.” Larsa hit back with a spicy boast. “[Marcus] wears a size 15 shoe, so I think he’s OK,” she said. Larsa and Marcus were first linked in September 2022 before making their relationship Instagram-official in January. In the photo shared on Larsa’s page, the twosome can be seen posing in front of a massive floral arrangement inspired by Jordan’s No. 23 Bulls jersey. During a recent appearance on the “Tamron Hall Show,” Larsa shared how she and Marcus got together. “I think we were just together a lot with our friends and it just happened,” said Larsa, who told Hall that she and Marcus first crossed paths at a party in Los Angeles four years ago. Larsa married former NBA star Pippen in 1997 before the pair finalized their divorce in 2021. They share four children together: sons Scotty Jr., Preston, 21, and Justin, 18, and 14-year-old daughter Sophia. Pippen won six NBA championships with Jordan when they played for the Bulls in the 1990s. The team was chronicled in the ESPN docuseries, “The Last Dance.” Pippen, 57, previously expressed displeasure over his portrayal in the show that Jordan, 60, had a heavy influence over. Part one of the “Real Housewives of Miami” reunion airs Thursday on Peacock.
