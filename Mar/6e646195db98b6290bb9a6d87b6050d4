A teenage girl was home alone when Pete Davidson’s speeding car smashed into her family’s Beverly Hills house — leaving her “a bit” traumatized and convinced there’d been an earthquake, according to her family. The 16-year-old’s dad told TMZ that his daughter was reading a book late Saturday when the 29-year-old comedian crashed his Mercedes with girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders, 26, riding shotgun. The high-end car — which cops said was being driven “at a high rate of speed” — struck just outside the living room, damaging a wall and knocking a window out of its frame, the homeowner said. The impact was so intense that the teen was convinced she was in an earthquake, leaving her “a bit” traumatized, said her dad. Luckily, the girl was uninjured — and the family has no plans to sue the “Saturday Night Live” alum, who immediately apologized to the teen at the scene, the outlet said. The father and daughter were not identified. Beverly Hills police confirmed to The Post that the car crash also damaged city property — a fire hydrant seen gushing water at the scene — but did not say if there is an ongoing investigation. There were no arrests, and sources previously told TMZ that drugs and alcohol are not believed to have been a factor.
