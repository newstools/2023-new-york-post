In this week’s Marchand and Ourand Sports Media Podcast sponsored by WSC Sports: Diamond Sports, which operates 19 regional sports networks, is headed into bankruptcy. Warner Bros. Discovery told teams that it is weeks away from shutting down its three AT&T SportsNet RSNs for good. Hosts Andrew Marchand and John Ourand discuss how the failing financial fortunes at the regional sports networks will affect how fans watch the games. Marchand and Ourand also provide updates on the Pac-12 media rights situation and review Apple’s first weekend with MLS games. They also talk about the TV futures of Charles Barkley and Frank Thomas. As always, the duo provide their picks for who in sports media is up – and who in sports media is down – for the week. Click here for more information about WSC Sports.
