The Masters Tournament is almost here, but you don’t have to wait for winter to end to start getting in the spirit. Play at home with TruGolf Mini Golf Simulator. This affordable, lifelike golf simulator uses E6 Connect-powered software to bring you a realistic game on digital courses, and it might even get the whole family interested in your favorite game. TruGolf is only $199.99, but that price is only going to stick around until March 15 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Practice your short game a short walk from the couch. TruGolf lets you stay home and play the game you love, and it might even help you improve when you hit the links for real. Every time you swing, TruGolf will give you detailed analytics that tell you all about your club face angle, angle of attack, swing tempo, and club path. It’s like having a golf coach that can see every detail of your swing and is ready to help you train. The ball may be digital, but TruGolf’s swing trainer does simulate the feeling of an impact of an actual ball. Look out for a powerful click in your club to know when you sent the ball flying. One reviewer writes, “I got it for my son for Christmas. He loves it! Best purchase ever! He played it with his dad and they played it for hours. As they say”it’s not a video game…it’s like playing on a real course!” There’s a little less than a month left until the Masters Tournament starts.

Play range games, carnival swing challenges, and demolition driving range with customizable difficulties for beginner and experienced golfers. Between the fun mini games and the challenge of competitive full course gameplay, TruGolf could be a hole-in-one at your Masters Tournament party.
