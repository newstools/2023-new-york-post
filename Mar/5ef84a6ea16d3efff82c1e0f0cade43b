Two Texas men were arrested for allegedly chasing down a teenager and holding him at gunpoint after a game of ding-dong ditch went horribly wrong. Michael Aguero and Richard Dietz were arrested by San Antonio Police on Friday and charged with aggravated robbery in connection of the Jan. 14 incident, according to court records obtained by KSAT. Police said a group of teenagers was running around the neighborhood near Nash Avenue, ringing doorbells and running away. However at one point, one of the teens fell behind. Dietz ran down the teenager and screamed at him to get on his knees when he caught up, police said. Aguero then pulled up with the gun and demanded the teen hand over their ID. The teen told the men that he did not have his ID on him. They then demanded his cell phone and drove away from the scene, according to SAPD. Dietz was identified by the teen in a lineup, and Aguero was later identified as the armed man. The teenâ€™s phone was returned. The pair were booked in the Bexar County Jail. Their bonds are set at $50,000 each.
