A Florida man is facing multiple charges after police say he opened fire on his roommates after one was naked in his teenage daughter’s room. Dayne Victor Miller, 44, was arrested at his home early Wednesday after he called police and admitted to shooting at his two adult roommates through a closed bedroom door, the Cape Coral police said in a statement. According to the official report, Miller told dispatchers that he fired at the pair after learning one of them was naked in his teenage daughter’s room. The victim in question later told police that they accidentally got into bed in Miller’s daughter’s room after drinking excessively. The other roommate, their spouse, allegedly shouted that they were in the wrong room after Miller’s daughter alerted her father that there was a naked man in her room. The victims said Miller shouted “I’ll kill you!” before firing his handgun three or four times into the floor just outside the couple’s closed bedroom door. Miller was subsequently charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and one weapon offense. As of Friday morning, he remained in custody with the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. He is due back in court on April 10.
