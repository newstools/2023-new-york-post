Calling all ruff-looking dogs. Applications for the 2023 “World’s Ugliest Dog” competition officially went live Saturday, according to ABC News affiliate WEAR. According to the competition’s website, the goal is to celebrate “the imperfections that make all dogs special and unique.” “The annual World’s Ugliest Dog Contest is not about making fun of ‘ugly’ dogs, but having fun with some wonderful characters and showing the world that these dogs are really beautiful,” continues the site. According to the site, those wishing to take place in the competition must file an application including a photo, short biography and vaccine records. The official competition is scheduled to take place on June 23rd at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in California. Also according to the site, all the dogs will be judged in “one large class” instead of by breed. The winner of the competition will be awarded  $1,500 as well as a trophy declaring them the “World’s Ugliest Dog.” In 2022, the competition crowned a 17-year-old Chinese crested-Chihuahua mix named Mr. Happy Face as the most recent champion.
