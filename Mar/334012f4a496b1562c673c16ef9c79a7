Liv Morgan is setting the record straight on her viral Madison Square Garden moment. The WWE superstar was taking in Tuesday night’s Knicks game, minding her own business, when she suddenly went viral for appearing to be completely uninterested in the man who was talking to her. Morgan appeared on “The Bump” on WWE’s social channels to talk about the phenomenon of being an internet sensation. “I have so many thoughts. I have so many things I want to say. What a bizarre moment,” she said. “It’s so weird to me what goes viral and what doesn’t. First of all, I just want to say that we had no idea that we were even being filmed. We had no idea that the camera was on us, which doesn’t excuse anything.” The video has been viewed nearly six million times on Twitter alone as of Wednesday night. She revealed that the man was not a random Knicks fan trying to woo her, but Justin Scalise, a WWE live event executive. “He was explaining something to me and I was watching the game, and I was listening, but I was also kind of deep in my head thinking my own thoughts, kind of in my own world — just so unaware that this was being filmed,” she said. “My phone was just blowing up, and I just see this footage and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, Justin, I’m so sorry!’ He’s been such a good sport about it.” Morgan had been at the Knicks game to promote WrestleMania; she is a former SmackDown women’s champion. She continued to talk about the surreality of going spontaneously viral. “It was the most bizarre, weirdest thing,” Morgan said. “It was so weird but let’s say I was ignoring him — it is Women’s History Month.”
