It’s the final day of the college basketball regular season, and the Big Ten Conference takes center stage. One of the more intriguing matchups is Maryland going on the road to face Penn State. The Terrapins have been one of the Big Ten’s surprise teams this season at 20-10. Maryland has been a different team away from home, however, going just 2-8. Penn State enters Sunday playing some of its best basketball of the season. The Nittany Lions are 4-1 in their past five games, including a last-second overtime win over Northwestern on Wednesday. Penn State is better than its 18-12 record. The problem the Nittany Lions face in the Big Ten is their lack of size. Penn State ranks dead last in offensive rebounding, which can be a big issue on nights when shots aren’t falling. The first time the two teams met, Penn State pulled down three offensive rebounds, though Maryland managed just four. The Nittany Lions were out-rebounded by just five, which is a win for them. If they can finish with a similar result on Sunday, it’s advantage Penn State. The Terps won the first meeting, 74-68 at home, in a game that was competitive throughout. But Maryland struggles to score on the road. In their seven road losses, the Terps have averaged just 57.7 points. Look for Maryland’s road woes to continue, as Penn State ends the regular season with a win. The play: Penn State, -2.
