Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Wednesday: The legend of Ronny Mauricio grew again Wednesday in the Mets’ 8-4 win over the Marlins at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla., as he homered for the third time in seven at-bats this spring. Brooks Raley got the win, but he gave up a run on three hits in his one inning of work. The lefty pitched well for Tampa Bay last year. Manager Buck Showalter said he gave his scorecard to a Mets fan sitting behind the visiting dugout who was especially intense and could be heard throughout the ballpark. “He deserved it,’’ Showalter said. “To have that energy level for an entire game, he never stopped. … It was impressive.” Carlos Carrasco will get the start against the Braves at Clover Park at 1:10 p.m.
