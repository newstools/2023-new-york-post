Olivia Dunne is in a New York state of mind. LSU’s superstar gymnast posted a collection of Instagram photos Sunday that were geotagged from New York, days after the Tigers finished with high marks in a quad meet Friday against California, Washington, and George Washington. “Came back for a bagel,” the 20-year-old Dunne quipped in the caption. In the photos, Dunne — who has nearly four million Instagram followers — is seen posing on the sidewalk and in the street while bundled up in a black jacket with a matching top, black leggings, and brown platform booties. Regarded as one of the most influential college athletes, Dunne’s social media reach also expands to TikTok, where she has shared videos in paid partnerships with different companies. In the wake of one of Dunne’s most recent clips, which promoted Caktus AI, an artificial intelligence tool with a focus on education, LSU issued a statement cautioning the usage of such platforms, sans a specific call out. “At LSU, our professors and students are empowered to use technology for learning and pursuing the highest standards of academic integrity,” the statement read, according to The Advocate. “However, using AI to produce work that a student then represents as one’s own could result in a charge of academic misconduct, as outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.” The video in question features Dunne using the Caktus AI platform on her laptop before giving a thumbs up to the camera. “Need to get my creativity flowing for my essay due at midnight,” Dunne wrote over the video, which has amassed more than one million views as of Monday. Dunne is currently in her junior year at LSU and returned to gymnastics last month after being sidelined with injuries.
