Boston College may not boast an impressive résumé on the surface, but the Eagles (15-16) are currently in the midst of their best season in a decade. And they should have little trouble scoring an easy win in Tuesday’s ACC Tournament opener against arguably the worst team in the conference. For as bad as Boston College has been for years, Louisville has been even worse in Kenny Payne’s first year at the helm. (7 p.m. ET., ACCN) The Cardinals (4-27) have lost four straight by at least 15 points entering Tuesday’s tilt, and they’ve been outscored by 12.1 points per game in conference play — the third-worst mark by any team in a Power 5 conference. The biggest issue, among many things, is turnovers. Louisville ranks near the very bottom of the country in turnover rate (22.5 percent) and unforced turnover rate (11.9 percent), which has hamstrung an already anemic offense and given opponents easy opportunities to score. That was an issue in the team’s 10-point loss at Boston College when the Cardinals coughed it up 19 times and allowed the Eagles to score 1.17 points per possession. It won’t get any easier Tuesday at a neutral site, which hasn’t gone well for Louisville to this point. The Cardinals’ only four wins all season have come at home, and they’ve been outscored by an average of 16.7 points on the road and 25.7 points in three neutral-site games. This one shouldn’t be close. Boston College -5.5 (BetMGM)
