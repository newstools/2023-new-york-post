A 21-year-old person is miffed over their man’s new arm tattoo — as there’s more to it than meets the eye. The perturbed partner, who goes by Finn Faye Gentry online and uses they/them pronouns, posted a photo of the new ink this week to Twitter, snatching more than 31,000 likes and hundreds of retweets. “Parker came home with this tattoo and is insisting it doesn’t look like a p—y guys please back me up that is a eyevagina,” Gentry tweeted along with a snap of a partially opened eye sans lashes. Gentry said they felt “bad” for Parker in subsequent tweets — as other users admitted the NSFW design is eyebrow-raising. “That is eyegina that is what i thought at first glance,” one Twitter user declared in the thread. “Like why would he get it facing vertical anyway like it makes it even worse,” chimed in another. “Clitiris,” quipped someone else. “First thing I saw was definitely a vagina,” proclaimed one person. “This tattoo confuses me so much because if it is an eye, why is it looking all the way to the outside like something is happening way over to the right??” another mused. “Bro the funniest part is the p—y on my guys arm not my missed joke i was so eager to share this with the masses i wasn’t thinking,” Gentry responded to the jokey comments. They added: “My biggest fear is the artist finding it and like the tattoo isn’t even like bad but like… the design. the art is good but the choice of art is… questionable.” Parker isn’t the only unfortunate ink enthusiast to be put on social media blast recently — others have suffered similar tattoo snafus. Just last month, a soccer superfan got prematurely inked to celebrate his favorite team’s win — only for the team to lose. One person even scored a vagina tattoo on purpose — and on their face — despite the artist’s best attempts to dissuade them. And some people have even gone so far as tattooing their eyeballs, risking potential blindness and major regret.
