She’s making a very sweet proposal. A Florida woman has hit headlines after calling for a “Sugar Daddy and Mommy Appreciation Day” in Boca Raton. The blond bombshell  -— who identified herself as Ashley Cream — took to the microphone at a Boca Raton Planning and Zoning board meeting Thursday to propose that March 10 should become a designated day to celebrate the area’s benefactors. “Sugar daddies, both gay and straight, and yes, even sugar mommies, are responsible for college educations, cars, homes, rents, jets … and the occasional body enhancement,” Cream claimed in footage obtained by local outlet KATV. She argued that sugar daddies and mommies are vital to the Florida economy and that Boca Raton is a particular hot spot for the generous geriatrics. It appeared that Cream may have her own sugar daddy, as she was accompanied to the meeting by an elderly man whom she was later seen pushing around in a wheelchair. The board did not rule on the request, citing it as “a City Council issue.” This is not the first time that sugar daddies have been brought up in an official setting in Florida. In April last year, a woman in the trial of high school shooter Nikolas Cruz said that she needed to be dismissed from the pool of potential jurors due to the fact that she had a “sugar daddy” that she saw every day. The woman, identified as Miss Bristol, said that she was unable to be on the jury due to the fact that it would be a financial “hardship” if she could not see her sugar daddy. “If I do this case for six months, I have a hardship, that means my sugar daddy can’t support me,” Bristol said to WPLG. “It’s all day for six months and what’s my hardship? I need my sugar daddy money.” Bristol was later dismissed by Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer.
