Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Friday: Right-hander Jhony Brito, who is among the starting pitching depth who will be counted on if the Yankees’ rotation sustains more injuries, threw three innings of one-run ball in relief of Luis Severino. “Easy velocity on his fastball, easy command with the fastball,” manager Aaron Boone said. “For him it’s about getting a little better with his secondary stuff.” Estevan Florial, who could have an opportunity in center field with Harrison Bader injured, started there Friday and went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts. Tigers pitcher Kervin Castro used both of his disengagements during an at-bat by DJ LeMahieu in the third inning, which allowed Yankees first baseman Billy McKinney to get a huge jump and steal second base. Under the new rules, had Castro tried to throw over to first base, he would have needed to record an out or else McKinney would have been awarded second base. The Yankees have a pair of split-squad games at 1:05 p.m., with Domingo German getting the start at home against the Phillies and Ryan Weber starting against the Pirates in Bradenton, Fla.
