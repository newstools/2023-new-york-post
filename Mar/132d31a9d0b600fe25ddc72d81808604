Ja Morant’s time away from the court doesn’t have a timetable, Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins said on Sunday. Morant was suspended following an Instagram Live video he posted early Saturday morning of himself brandishing a gun at a club. The Grizzlies originally announced Morant would be away from the team for at least two games, but Jenkins hinted that absence could be longer. “We’re taking it one day at a time,” Jenkins told reporters on Sunday before the Grizzlies face the Clippers. “There’s no definitive timeline… It’s really not a timetable situation.” Morant was involved in other off-court controversies before getting suspended, with the 23-year-old reportedly getting in separate confrontations with a teenager and a security guard. No arrests were made for both altercations. But Morant was sued for allegedly assaulting the teen and flashing a gun at him after a pick-up game last summer. Morant has said he was acting in self defense. The point guard went live on Instagram early Saturday, displaying himself shirtless at a club while rapping to music, and displayed a handgun. Jenkins said Sunday the video was a “very tough moment.” Following his suspension, Morant said in a statement he takes “full responsibility” for his actions. “I’m sorry to my family, teammates, coaches, fans, partners, the city of Memphis and the entire organization for letting you down,” the statement read. “I’m going to take some time away to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.” Nike, who is partnered with Morant, supported the All-Star guard, with the athletic-wear titan saying in a statement they “appreciate Ja’s accountability.” Jenkins said the Grizzlies also back Morant’s healing process, adding they “love him.” “He understands he’s made some difficult decisions and poor choices,” Jenkins said. “He understands he’s got to get help to get to a better place, not just for himself but for his team”
