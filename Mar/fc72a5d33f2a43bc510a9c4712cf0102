Patrick Kane is on the board. The Rangers’ high-profile trade deadline acquisition notched his first goal with the team on Thursday night, sending a power play snipe from just above the faceoff dot past Canadiens goalie Sam Montembeault. Kane’s tally, assisted by Jacob Trouba and Artemi Panarin, knotted the score at three in the second period at the Bell Centre in Montreal. Mika Zibanejad scored the game-winner in the shootout to give the Rangers a hard-fought 4-3 victory. The score came 1:21 after the Habs took a 3-2 lead on a shorthanded goal by Josh Anderson, who capitalized on Kane’s flub of a pass in the Montreal zone. The 34-year-old, who scored his first goal in his third game with the team, celebrated his 17th goal of the season with an emphatic fist pump before the obligatory teammate hugs and high-fives.
