Cops are looking to corral two brazen bandits who pistol-whipped an elderly man and took off with $200 cash and cell phones this week, authorities said. The ugly episode unfolded Monday at 10:45 a.m. when two men walked into the Bayacan Barbershop on Post Avenue, near West 207th Street in Inwood, displayed firearms and announced the stick-up, police said. The victim, who suffered a cut on the head, was transported to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in stable condition, police said. The robbers struck a 71-year-old man in the head with a gun, took $200 and multiple cell phones before speeding off in a gray Ford Fusion, cops said. Cops are looking for two men between 20 and 30 years old with a medium complexion. The NYPD on Saturday released surveillance photos of the suspects. One was last seen sporting a labor union vest, black hooded sweatshirt, black pants, black sneakers, black face mask and a gray knit cap. His accomplice was last spotted wearing a black jacket, blue jeans, black sneakers and a black Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPDâ€™s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477)
