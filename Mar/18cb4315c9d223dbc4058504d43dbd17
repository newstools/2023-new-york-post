A 61-year-old woman was left bloodied after she was randomly stabbed by a stranger on a street in Midtown, Manhattan, on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The victim was at West 57th Street and Seventh Avenue around 3:40 p.m. when the stranger stabbed her twice in the right shoulder, cops said. The woman, whose name wasn’t released, was taken to Roosevelt Hospital in stable condition. Her blood was seen splattered on the sidewalk near the USA Brooklyn Diner two blocks south of Central Park. Construction worker Jose Valencia, 30, was installing scaffolding when the bleeding woman ran up to him and his co-workers. “She was just scared,” he said. “We heard a loud scream and she ran up to the guys working on the scaffolding… Basically, she started looking at her arms. Blood was coming down her right arm.” She said she was “just randomly stabbed with a knife.” He gave her a rag to tie around her arm. “The blood was coming out and she was bleeding pretty bad, but she was alright,” he said. “At first she didn’t even know she was bleeding,” he said. “She felt something was wrong and then saw the blood falling down her shirt, her arm. The whole shirt she had on was pretty badly covered in blood. That’s when she saw she had a stab wound.” Valencia said the knife-wielding man “approached her randomly. It’s like if me walking by you and stabbing you in the arm — that’s pretty much what happened.” The attacker was last seen running off on West 57th Street toward Eighth Avenue. He was wearing an orange hooded shirt. The attack stunned nearby workers. “A person going around stabbing people is dangerous,” said a doorman who was working across the street from the stabbing scene. “The city is getting dangerous. Everywhere in New York City is getting dangerous.”
