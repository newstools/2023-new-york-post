Art has long been a form of self-expression, amusement, and a significant part of understanding world history and culture, but methods of creating art have changed significantly through time. Featured in the 2023 Consumer Electronics (CES) show, WOMBO’s AI art tool, Dream, is changing modern art. This app takes just a few words and turns them into a beautiful piece of artwork in seconds, available until March 7 for only $49.99 (reg. $169.99). The Dream application can make your imagination a reality. Simply input a short description of whatever you want to create: “Rainbow fairy”, “UFO lifting cows”, or anything else that you can imagine out of billions of possibilities. Along with your idea, you may pick an overall art style that you’d like for the work, such as choosing for the piece to be bright and colorful, or dark and dreary. Dream then uses the power of artificial intelligence to bring your idea to life. With the Premium Plan, you get to enjoy additional features like extra art styles to choose from, get a supporter role in the Wombo Dream Discord, get three generated variations for each art piece, and save as a video to share your artwork with friends and family. This AI art app has over 10 million downloads, was named Google’s Best Overall App of 2022, and is rated at 4.8 out of 5 stars on the App Store. Traditional art supplies can be expensive, take up valuable space, or be a physical barrier to some wanting to create art. Now anybody with an iOS or Android device can be an artist with just a few clicks, across as many devices as they want. Create art in seconds with a lifetime subscription to Dream by WOMBO AI Art Tool’s premium plan for just $49.99 (reg. $169.99). Hurry, this app is only available through March 7.
