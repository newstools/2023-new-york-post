A pervert groped a 15-year-old girl on a Manhattan train over the weekend, cops said Monday. The young victim was riding a southbound No. 7 train approaching the Grand Central-42 Street station in Times Square around 8:40 p.m. Sunday when the creep – who appeared to be in his 40s – approached her and tried to start up a conversation, authorities said. He then began to touch the inside of the young victim’s upper thigh, cops said. The girl got up and moved to another seat in the train car to get away from the stranger, police said. When the train pulled into the station, the sicko fled, but the victim stayed on board, cops said. The NYPD released photos of the suspect, though it’s unclear who took them or provided them to police. The man, who is still on the loose, is described as about 5-foot-8 and 170 pounds, with a medium complexion, thin build, black hair, facial hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a neon orange and yellow jacket, a black and white baseball hat, tan pants and tan boots.
