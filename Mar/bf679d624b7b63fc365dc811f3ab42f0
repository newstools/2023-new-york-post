A shameless mugger knocked an elderly woman in the face before snatching her purse in a ruthless attack in the Bronx Sunday, police said. The 70-year-old victim was jumped by the stranger at the corner of East Kingsbridge Road and East Fordham Road in Fordham Manor at 4:45 a.m., police said. The brute grabbed onto the woman’s purse and elbowed her in the face, knocking out her tooth, according to cops. He ran off with the victim’s bag but was chased down by two good Samaritans who witnessed the attack. The pair recovered the woman’s bag but were unable to stop the thief. He fled down Kingsbridge Road toward East 192nd Street, police said. Police release a surveillance image of the suspect Sunday night and ask anyone with information regarding the suspect or attack to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
