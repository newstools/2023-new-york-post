Sports betting is now live in Massachusetts and in-state residents can get their hands on the FanDuel Massachusetts promo code that lets new customers place a $5 bet to get $200 in bonus bets! Just use this link or click the module below to activate the offer. For those outside Massachusetts, you can get FanDuel’s regular new customer offer that gives new customers $200 in bonus bets (bet credits) with just a $20 first bet. Bonus bets can be used to make profits on winning bets, but they can’t be withdrawn from the sportsbook and put in a bank account. If you used $20 in bonus bets on the Celtics at +130 and they win, you would profit $26. If they lost, the bonus amount wagered is gone but you don’t lose any actual money. Click the links below for more information about both offers ahead of the Houston Rockets hosting the Chicago Bulls. Not an NBA fan? No problem, because these offers work for all sports markets on FanDuel.  Massachusetts residents can use the FanDuel go-live promo code to claim $200 in bonus bets. If you aren’t in Massachusetts, the standard FanDuel promo code gives new users $200 in bet credits with just a $20 first bet. If you use the promo codes on a losing wager, that money is still returned back as bet credits. With so many fun NBA games in Saturday’s schedule, why would I focus on a game between two losing teams? Because one of those teams is the Houston Rockets and it’s always a good idea to bet against them at this point in the season, especially if they are playing a competent team. FanDuel Sportsbook favors Chicago by seven points and frankly I’m surprised the spread isn’t higher. Houston is having an awful season at 15-51 and gets beat by an average of 8.2 points per game. The Bulls aren’t some great team, either, but they have good players in Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and they won’t be lacking in motivation because they still have a chance to get into the Eastern Conference play-in tournament. Ultimately, this comes down to fading one of the worst teams in the NBA, so expect the Rockets to do Rockets-type things and take Chicago to cover with the FanDuel promo code.
