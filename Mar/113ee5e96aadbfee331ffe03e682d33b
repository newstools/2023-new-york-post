Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick still is described as a victim of January 6, murdered by Trump supporters rioting at the Capitol, despite an autopsy report which shows he died of a stroke the following day. The New York Times initially reported that Sicknick had been beaten to death with a fire extinguisher, before retracting the claim more than a month later. To this day, media accounts claim Sicknick was “slain” on Jan. 6, and powerful Democrats, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi have continued to cite his death as evidence of a “deadly insurrection” at the Capitol that day. But hitherto unseen surveillance footage from inside the Capitol, aired by Fox News host Tucker Carlson Monday night, contradicts that claim. It shows Officer Sicknick walking through the building “after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside.” Sicknick appears to be healthy and walking normally in the footage. He gesticulates to protesters to move out of the building, and bends down to move a placard behind a statue. He also is wearing a helmet so, as Carlson points out, “it’s hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury.” “Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not the result of violence he suffered at the entrance to the Capitol. This tape overturns the single most powerful and politically useful lie the Democrats have told us about January 6.” Electronic bookmarks archived on the Capitol database show that the Jan. 6 committee examined the same footage of a healthy Sicknick walking around the Capitol after the violence ended. But Carlson says “they refused to release this tape to the public because this tape would shatter the fraud they were perpetrating on the country, because hiding the truth served their political interests.”
