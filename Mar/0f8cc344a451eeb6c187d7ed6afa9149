A New Jersey dad fatally shot his wife, his teen son and then himself in their home, authorities said Wednesday. Police responded to a home in the Succasunna neighborhood Tuesday morning for a welfare check and discovered the three bodies, according to the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office. County authorities say Peter Ventricelli, 57, fatally shot his 58-year-old wife, Kellie, and 15-year-old son, Anthony, inside their house on Justine Place early Tuesday morning before turning the firearm on himself. The motive of Ventricelli, who worked as a private contractor, remained unclear. “This is a tragic murder suicide brought on by domestic violence. It is a heartbreaking loss for the Ventricelli family,” Morris County Prosecutor Robert Carroll said. “Neighbors, schoolmates, friends and the Roxbury community as a whole are mourning this shocking and senseless loss of life. We ask that citizens exercise discretion and compassion while discussing the situation on social media.” An active investigation remained open Wednesday evening, according to prosecutors, who added that there is no danger to the community and more information will be released “at the appropriate time.” The Roxbury Police Department and Morris County Sheriff’s Office are also investigating, according to the county authorities. Roxbury Public Schools on Tuesday night notified parents of the loss of one of its high-schoolers. “It is with a heavy heart that we share the devastating news of the loss of one of our high school students,” the Facebook post said. “The high school administration and staff have coordinated supports and resources for students and staff who may need them.” Morris County is ranked as the second-wealthiest county in the Garden State, by per-capita income, according to a study published last year by the financial technology company SmartAsset.
