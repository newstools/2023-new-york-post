Here are some nuggets from Yankeesâ€™ spring training on Friday: Aaron Judge doubled in each of his first two plate appearances Friday in a 5-3 loss to the Tigers, one on a broken-bat fly ball off the left-field wall and another one ripped at 108.4 mph off the bat to the left-field corner. Shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa committed his first error of the spring, booting a routine ground ball by Tyler Nevin in the second inning Gerrit Cole had no issues in his first game with the pitch clock. He experimented with different timings, including once when the batter had already used his only timeout and Cole ran the clock almost all the way down before beginning his delivery. Luis Severino gets the start against the Rays for a 1:05 p.m. game at Steinbrenner Field.
