An argument ended with a gunshot fired near the Upper Manhattan home of First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Schools Chancellor David Banks, sources told The Post. Wright and Banks were not hurt in the 4:15 a.m. incident and are not thought to be the intended targets, police sources added. Cops recovered a shell casing a block away from the home near the corner of West 143rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, the sources said. Percell Hurdle, 64, was arrested and charged with attempted murder, attempted assault, criminal use of a firearm, reckless endangerment, and criminal possession of a weapon in the incident, sources said. There was no immediate word on what sparked the gunplay. Wright, 52, heard the shots and her detail notified the NYPD, the sources said. The incident was caught on cameras at the home, which Wright is believed to share with the chancellor. There were no injuries or property damage reported, the sources said. “I’m scared. I have two children,” a 38-year-old neighbor told The Post, adding she heard cursing and arguing around 3 a.m. and then “one shot,” sirens and police talking. “I went out and a neighbor told me they had taken somebody [into custody].” “I am fed up with all the shootings going on around here. I have requested to move,” the woman added. “When I moved here 10 years ago it was peaceful. Now I see more violence in the last four years. After COVID, it got even worse.” The woman said she heard someone with “power” called cops. “That’s good that she called. If somebody doesn’t die, they don’t block the streets off for hours so it’s a blessing that she was home and she called,” the woman said. The NYPD did not immediately have information regarding the incident. The gunplay occurred as shooting incidents were down 21% in 2023, to 148 from 187 incidents as compared to the same time last year through March 5, NYPD data show.
