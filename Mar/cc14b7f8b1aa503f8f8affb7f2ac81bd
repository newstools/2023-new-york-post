Two historic Eastern Conference rivals face off in New England when the Boston Celtics host the New York Knicks. Boston is listed as a four-point favorite on bet365 Sportsbook and I would go with the Celtics tonight, even though New York is playing great basketball. The Knicks have earned every bit of their 38-27 record and ride into Boston on an eight-game winning streak. Jalen Brunson has proved to be an incredible addition and unsurprisingly Julius Randle is having one of the best seasons of his career. But the Celtics are still playing well despite their loss to Brooklyn on Friday. Boston has won four of its last six games and one of its only losses in that stretch was to New York in Madison Square Garden, so the Celtics will surely want revenge tonight. Beyond that, Boston should have more consistent scoring with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. This should be a tight one in the fourth quarter, but I think the Celtics pull away later. If you agree (or disagree) with that pick, use the bonus code NYP365 for a great deal on bet365 Sportsbook.
