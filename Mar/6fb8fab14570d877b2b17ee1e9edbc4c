This guy’s no Walter White. A desperate junkie apparently trying to break bad on the 4 train had his high expectations dashed — and left a disgusting spread of over-the-counter allergy meds behind for all to see. “Never seen a mess quite like this!” tweeted straphanger Carolyn Crapo, 58, posting images last week of what appeared to be a botched rolling meth lab at the Woodlawn station in the Bronx. “Was Walter White trying to synthesize some [pseudoephedrine] or what?” “I’ve seen shooting up, the weed,” a hardened MTA conductor told The Post. “Cooking up is the only thing I haven’t seen.” The scene turned out to be more Breaking Sad than “Breaking Bad” though. Based on the pills’ packaging, the cornucopia of smashed Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra pills left behind all lacked the chemical pseudoephedrine, a key ingredient for making meth. Still, the med mess was a new low in the eyes of many subway riders, who decried the regular presence of homelessness and drug use on their daily commutes, in addition to last year’s 25-year-high in subway murders. “Everybody in the train should not have to see that, kids and adults,” cried speech pathologist Grace Bomide, 29, adding that someone attempting whip up a fresh batch of crank on the train “is completely unacceptable.” Citing the influx of police patrol on the platforms, Bomide said that “there’s been a lot more police patrol but there’s still a lot more work to be done.” MTA communications director Tim Minton emphasized that “among the activities not permitted under the New York City Transit Rules of Conduct is running a meth production lab on the 4 train.” Luke Nasta, CEO of Camelot drug treatment centers, said the pills also could have been left behind by a desperate addict simply looking for a quick fix with whatever substance they could get their hands on. “If a person is desperate to get high, either because they’re a habitual drug user or because they have mental illness, they’ll try anything,” Nasta said.
