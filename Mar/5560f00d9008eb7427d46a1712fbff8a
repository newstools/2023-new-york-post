The Jussie Smollett chronicles will be revisited in a new docuseries from Fox Nation. The five-part docuseries “Jussie Smollett: Anatomy of a Hoax” is set for release on March 13. It will feature exclusive interviews with brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who have never previously spoken to the media about the part they played in the elaborate plot to stage a hate crime on Smollett, 40, four years ago. “‘Anatomy of a Hoax’ takes a deep dive into a scam that reverberated through the worlds of entertainment, pop culture and politics,” said John Finley, the streaming platform’s executive vice president, in a press release. “We’re excited for viewers to hear the real stories behind this scandal from the Osundairo brothers for the very first time.” The Osundairo brothers are expected to share details of the events, including the planning and execution of the staged crime, as well as the aftermath that the saga brought. In January 2019, Smollett claimed to police that he was the victim of a hate crime by two men who shouted, “This is MAGA country,” while beating him and putting a noose around his neck. Chicago police later concluded that the attack was staged and that Smollett had hired the Osundairo brothers and paid them $3,500 to fake the crime. The “Empire” actor was released from jail in March 2022 after an Illinois state appellate court ruled he could go free while his lawyers appeal his conviction for staging a hate crime — after having served only six days of his 150-day sentence for five counts of felony disorderly conduct. Smollett continues to maintain his innocence and his deadline to file an appeal is today, March 1. The docuseries will “chronicle the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and drama that turned the star into a pariah and sent shockwaves through Chicago and beyond, leaving a trail of damaged careers and reputations,” according to the release.
