When we say “HP” what do you think of? To our minds, there’s only two options. The first: the initials of one of the most famous boy wizards of all time, The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter. The second is the manufacturer of trusty, high-performance laptops, amongst other tech, HP, short for Hewlett-Packard, which is not quite as catchy a name for a boy wizard. But with deals like this, their name doesn’t have to be catchy. It’ll stick in your head on the strength of the deals alone. For example, this HP Pavilion 15 Laptop, on sale this week on Amazon for over $200 off. With all the power of PC, this durable, portable laptop comes fitted out with an 11th Generation Intel Core, 512GB of hard drive storage, suberb Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and more, the HP Pavilion 15 would have been a steal at list price, and is only doubly so at 26% off this week from Amazon. Work, play, and game wherever you may be with the HP Pavilion 15 Laptop, capable of a battery life of up to eight hours, and 50% of that off just 45 minutes of charge. This light, sustainable laptop has a full-size keyboard, a 15.6-inch Full HD micro-edged screen, and nearly unparalleled responsiveness. This deal won’t be around forever. We suggest you save 26% while you still can. For more content, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
