Tom Brady is back in on the sports action post-retirement. The seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback attended UFC 285 on Saturday in Las Vegas, where Jon Jones and Ciryl Gane squared off for the heavyweight title. Jones won in the first round after three-year sabbatical. After announcing his retirement from the NFL after 23 seasons, Brady”s most recent sighting was on a snowy get-away trip with his three children — Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian. Brady, 45, was seen coming in to the fight from a back entrance, and he was seated next to former Tampa Bay Buccaneers teammate and NFL wide receiver Mike Evans for the event. Brady also took to his Instagram, posting three stories of his excitement for the event, writing “WOW!!!!!!” and “LFG” and tagging Jon Jones, Dana White, and UFC. His first photo shows his reserved seat at the arena labeled “G.O.A.T.” It’s been an eventful year for the former quarterback, who finished up his last season in the NFL on a losing record (8-9), finalized a divorce with ex-wife supermodel Gisele Bündchen after 13 years of marriage and announced his retirement in February in an emotional video. This announcement came after a brief retirement a year ago from Brady that only lasted 40 days. “I’ll get to the point right away: I’m retiring. For good,” he said last month. “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time. So when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first,” Brady continued. “So, it won’t be long winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year.” Taking a year off after 23 seasons, Brady is set to segue into a Fox Sports broadcasting career in 2024 as the lead game analyst on a 10-year, $375 million contract.
