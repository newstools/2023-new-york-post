Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Wednesday: Anthony Volpe made a few slick plays in the sixth inning. The shortstop fielded a ball in the hole and, while falling to the dirt, fired to second base to get the lead runner. Later in the frame, Volpe fielded a grounder with runners on second and third base and threw behind Washington’s Luis Garcia, who was trying to advance from second to third. Garcia was tagged out in a rundown. Yankees pitchers Domingo German (one) and Yoendrys Gomez (two) hit three Nationals batters. Before the game, Yankees third-base coach Luis Rojas and Nationals adviser Dave Jauss caught up for several minutes on the field. The two had been manager and bench coach, respectively, for the Mets in 2021. Clay Holmes, Aaron Hicks, Gleyber Torres and Jasson Dominguez are among the Yankees expected to play in Brandenton, Fla., against the Pirates.
