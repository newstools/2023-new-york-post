Former President Donald Trump’s vocals are featured on a new track released Friday with the so-called “J6 Prison Choir,” a group of people locked up for their alleged involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol Building. The song, titled “Justice for All,” is available on music streaming platforms, such as Spotify, which amusingly lists Trump as the composer. The radio-friendly song, which runs 2 minutes and 20 seconds, features Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in an echoey voice over the Jan. 6 prisoner singing the “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The artwork for the single depicts a bleak-looking jail cell with a solitary window looking out at an American flag beyond a barbed-wire fence. Trump, 76, recorded his part for the track at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., a couple of weeks ago, according to Forbes. The inmates singing the national anthem were recorded over a phone about a month ago in the Washington, DC, jail where they await their trials, Forbes reported. The single was reportedly produced by a major recording artist who is not identified in the song’s credits. Profits from the new song will go to the families of people imprisoned for their alleged roles in the storming of the Capitol Building, but not to families of inmates who assaulted police officers, according to Forbes. The tune ends with the J6 Prison Choir repeatedly chanting “USA!” Trump said during an interview last year that if elected president again in 2024, he would give “full pardons with an apology” to “many” of the people convicted in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot that took after he held a so-called “Stop the Steal” rally outside the White House.
