The tallest building in Brooklyn is hoping to hit a high water mark by selling for a tippy-top price. The new 1,000-foot-tall residential Brooklyn Tower at 9 DeKalb Ave. is being marketed by Douglas Harmon and Adam Spies at Newmark — and is expected to sell for north of $600 million. According to Green Street, which broke the news of the offering in its Real Estate Alert, only 13 of the city’s residential buildings have sold for more than $500 million. The deal would not include the building’s 143 individual residential condominiums, but it would include its 398 rental apartments as well as amenities, such as the pool and fitness facilities that are provided by LifeTime Fitness in 77,000 square feet, and another roughly 50,000 square feet of retail. Of the rentals, 30% are affordable at 130% of the average local median income. The 93-story building was developed and is now being sold by Michael Stern‘s JDS Real Estate. It also carries a 35-year tax abatement. Harmon and Spies left Cushman & Wakefield last month, and this is their first offering for their new bosses at Newmark. A year ago, they sold the 761-unit American Copper Buildings on Manhattan’s East Side for JDS and Baupost Group for $837 million.
