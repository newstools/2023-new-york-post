Since Kevin Durant suited up for the Phoenix Suns, the team has won three straight and looked like real contenders. They’ll have to continue that streak without Durant now, for at least three weeks. The star forward rolled his ankle in warmups of what was going to be his home debut against the Thunder Wednesday night. Durant finished his pregame routine, but did not suit up against Oklahoma City. He will be re-evaluated after three weeks according to the team, which confirmed Durant’s injury Thursday night. The update is better news for the organization, which reportedly feared the injury could have him miss significant time, even the start of playoffs. If he’s able to return at that point, the Suns would have five regular seasons left to get Durant in postseason shape. Suns head coach Monty Williams understands Durant’s frustration, who was rehabbing a knee injury when he was traded by the Nets in an NBA trade deadline blockbuster. “He’s out there, working his tail off, getting ready for the game and twists his ankle,” Suns coach Monty Williams said after Wednesday’s game. “You can’t get frustrated about that. It’s life, you know what I’m saying? “I felt bad for him because he feels bad. I saw his face and —  I’ve been around him so many times — I know what he’s feeling, and I don’t want him feeling that way at all.” His previous MCL injury forced him to be sidelined for 20 games with Brooklyn this season. Phoenix didn’t seem to need its new superstar Wednesday night as it cruised to a 131-101 victory over the Thunder, thanks t Devin Booker’s 44 points. Sitting at 37-29, the Suns continue to claw their way up the Western Conference standings where they currently hold the four seed.
