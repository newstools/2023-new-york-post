Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Sunday: Ron Marinaccio, in his second Grapefruit League appearance after coming back from a shin injury that cost him the end of last season, struck out the side in the seventh inning as he continued to look sharp. Aaron Hicks singled in the fifth inning but then got picked off at first base by Red Sox reliever Chris Martin. Isiah Kiner-Falefa, playing for a third straight day and starting at third base for the first time this spring, singled in the second inning and then quickly stole second and third base. Kiner-Falefa, who stole a team-high 22 bases last season, stands to be more of a threat this season with the bigger bases and limited pickoffs. Non-roster invitee Tanner Tully will make the start against the Twins at 1:05 p.m. as the Yankees round out their two-game road trip to Fort Myers.
