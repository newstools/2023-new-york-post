Syracuse comes into this one as slight underdogs against a Wake Forest team they just beat by nine points on their home floor a few days ago. On a neutral floor, take the points and Jim Boeheim’s championship pedigree. Gametime: 12 p.m. ET TV: ESPN Live Stream: ESPN+, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Boeheim is looking at a second straight season without a trip to the NCAA Tournament, but the 78-year-old Orange coach hasn’t lost his first game of the ACC Tournament since the 2017 event in Brooklyn, where he infamously decried: “There’s no value to playing in Greensboro. None.” He returns to the longtime ACC base with a team four days removed from toppling the Demon Deacons, whose struggles against the Orange zone — featuring seven turnovers by ACC Player of the Year Tyree Appleby — will return with a quick turnaround.
