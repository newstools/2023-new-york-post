Patrick Mahomes is expecting it to be a “wild” week of NFL free agency. While players cannot technically sign till Wednesday when the NFL league year begins, the legal tampering period begins Monday at noon. That will set off a flurry of reports on deals being agreed to, even if it is not yet official. Eagles defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, Chiefs tackle Orlando Brown and 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo are among the top names out there this offseason as teams look to make splashes.
