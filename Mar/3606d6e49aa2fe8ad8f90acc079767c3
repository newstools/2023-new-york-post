Kanga even believe it? A group of albino kangaroos caused a stir Monday after being spotted at the Panorama Wildlife Sanctuary and Secret Gardens, the nature preserve wrote on its Facebook page. The sanctuary, which is located on Australia’s Mornington Peninsula, captioned the ‘roo-ly strange occurrence simply as “the mob.” According to the sanctuary’s owner, Annemaree Van Rooy, the property is home to nine albino kangaroos. “We rescued three albino kangaroos which were held in little tiny cages and now we have a mob of about nine,” Rooy told the Daily Mail. “They come and go as they please on the wildlife sanctuary, and they live just as they are supposed to out in the wild.” Rooy and her partner Mick Smith have been breeding the albino animals since rescuing the first three in 2012. In 2020, the business couple welcomed their first albino kangaroo baby when an eastern grey kangaroo mated with one of the genetically mutated animals. According to mammologist Mark Eldridge, the chances of producing a white kangaroo is one in every 50,000 to 100,000 animals. The Panorama Wildlife Sanctuary and Secret Gardens is also home to peacocks, guinea fowl, mini goats, geese, emus and swans. Newer additions include two alpacas, two pigs, 10 sheep, a little calf and two donkeys. Rooy also said the 55-acre property, which started as a family home, became the sanctuary due to her love of animals. “This is my home, this is where I live,” stated Rooy. “We started doing this because I have a passion for animals and their welfare and are always on the lookout for any animals that need rescuing.” Several Facebook followers were quick to hop into the comments. “And I thought albino roos were rare! But not at Panarama,” said one user. “They look like ghosts,” said another. “So many white ones, just gorgeous,” said a third Facebook user. “Would love to see them one day.”
