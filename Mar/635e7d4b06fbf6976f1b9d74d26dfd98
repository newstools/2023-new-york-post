Before Patrick Kane played in his first game as a member of the New York Rangers on Thursday night, the three-time Stanley Cup champion enjoyed a sweet moment with two of his biggest supporters. When taking the ice for warmups at Madison Square Garden ahead of a game against the Ottawa Senators, the 34-year-old forward skated his way to the boards, where he greeted girlfriend Amanda Grahovec and their 2-year-old son, Patrick, who was wearing his father’s Rangers jersey. Unfortunately for Kane, his first game as a Blueshirt didn’t end with a win as the Senators topped the Rangers, 5-3. Despite Thursday’s defeat, Kane remarked what an “amazing place” the Garden is to play. “The guys were kind of whispering about it around the room a little bit, but I didn’t really know what it was going to be like until I got out there,” Kane said. “Warm-ups, the pregame introduction, it’s pretty cool. It’s an amazing place to play.” It’s been a chaotic week for Kane, who was traded to the Rangers on Tuesday in a blockbuster move following 16 years with the Chicago Blackhawks. Leading up to the NHL trade deadline, which is Friday at 3 p.m., Kane expressed that the Rangers are a team “you definitely pay attention to and definitely are intrigued by, for obvious reasons.” With the Rangers gearing up for a four-game road trip that begins Saturday against the Bruins in Boston, Kane spoke Thursday about what it meant to have Amanda and Patrick in New York with him amid a dizzying few days. “It makes everything a little bit easier,” Kane said, according to NHL.com. “Great to have them along with me. Would have been nice to have my family here with me too, but they’ll make their way to a lot of games here down the stretch.” Kane’s parents were unable to attend Thursday’s game as his sister welcomed a baby one day prior. The Rangers, now 35-18-9 after Thursday, are in third place in the Metropolitan Division standings behind the Carolina Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils.
