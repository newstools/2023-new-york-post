This makeup company has abruptly closed a key location after more than a decade in business. As of early this month, MAC Cosmetics’ shop at 1540 Broadway is now boarded up, the beauty behemoth having thrown in the towel on its flagship location. “MAC closed the Times Square store based on the changing retail landscape,” a MAC representative told The Post. “We continue to invest in bringing dynamic, elevated consumer experiences at key retail locations across the U.S., including other nearby stores.” Opened in 2010, the 1,700-square-foot location featured makeup counters, product displays and a prominent presence in Times Square. At the time, Forever 21 and the Disney Store’s locations on the stretch between 46th and 47th streets were both still in development. Those outlets now remain, having outlived the cosmetics company on the block. MAC — which has already scrubbed the former Times Square location from its website — maintains six other locations in Manhattan, as well as multiple outer-borough shops. The closure isn’t part of any larger trend in the area, which has come springing back to its manic levels of traffic since becoming a ghost town during the pandemic. Last month, the president of the Times Square Alliance, Tom Harris, told The Post Times Square was back to reporting more than 260,000 daily visitors — a 17% decrease from 2019, but a 196% increase from 2021. The possibility of a future casino currently looms heavily over the neighborhood — and in terms of national trends, retail sales are reportedly soaring, reaching highs not seen in more than 20 years. But then, shoplifting has also recently been reported at record rates, and of course the internet continues to hurt brick-and-mortar shops.
