A North Carolina man has been charged for careening his hatchback into the terminal of Wilmington International Airport while evading police — and injuring a TSA agent who was scrambling to safety, officials said Friday. Tray Anthony Dvorak was nabbed just after 7 p.m. Thursday after busting through the fences surrounding the Wilmington, North Carolina, airport and driving into the airfield and onto the tarmac, North Hanover County Sheriff’s Lt. J.J. Brewer said. Authorities caught up to him as he was driving off the airfield, at which point he allegedly plowed his vehicle through the glass doors and windows of the terminal and onto the tiled floor. At least one law enforcement officer, a TSA agent, was injured, Brewer said. The woman broke her ankle as she ran away from the charging vehicle, he added. No other injuries to officers or the public were reported. A photo of the aftermath shows the white vehicle’s nearly ruined front, with the windshield shattered and the hood missing. The airport remained open and the crash had “minimal impact to operations,” a spokesperson wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Dvorak appeared stone-faced and was wearing a white, button-down shirt in his booking photo, provided by police. The Rocky Point, North Carolina, man was charged with assault with a deadly weapon on a government official, speeding to elude arrest, trespass on airport property, disorderly conduct and “resist obstruct delay a government official,” the sheriff’s office said. He was ordered held on a $50,000 secure bond and was due to appear in court via video conference on Friday.
