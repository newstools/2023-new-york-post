Jalen Brunson’s uncertain status moving forward remains status quo. The Knicks point guard, who missed Sunday’s double-overtime win over the Celtics in Boston, was listed by the team as questionable for Tuesday’s game against the Hornets at the Garden. Brunson, 26, is dealing with a sore left foot. It is unclear how he suffered the injury. He turned his right ankle late in the third quarter of Friday’s win over the Heat and finished the game, but this injury is unrelated, coach Tom Thibodeau said on Sunday. Immanuel Quickley started in place of Brunson against the Celtics and produced a career-high 38 points in 55 minutes, along with eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals. In the five games Brunson has missed, the Knicks are 3-2. Brunson, who’s averaging career-highs with 23.9 points and 6.2 assists per game, missed three games in late December with a hip injury and one game on Feb. 2 with a non-COVID illness.
