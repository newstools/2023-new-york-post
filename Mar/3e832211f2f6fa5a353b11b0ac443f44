They say a picture is worth a thousand words — and in this case, a book title. In celebration of World Book Day Thursday, UK-based elevator company Stannah put out a tweet challenging followers to identify 10 classic kid’s books by using emojis as clues. “In celebration of #WorldBookDay, we’ve created a brainteasing #book emoji quiz,” tweeted the stairlift and home lift company. “Our #SilverCensus study saw us ask more than 1,000 over-60s which stories they feel all children should read … and these sequences represent the top 10 answers.” How many of these classic children’s books can you name? Apparently, most only get six out of 10 answers correct. Put your emoji literacy and book knowledge to the test by solving the riddles below! 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. Now that you’ve finished guessing, check your answers below! WARNING: Spoilers Stannah’s tweet comes amid uproar from Gen Z about the nature of emojis and their apparent misuses. One Reddit user caused an online firestorm after demanding that the thumbs-up emoji and nine other emojis be canceled for being too passive-aggressive to use in an office setting. “For younger people, the thumbs-up emoji is used to be really passive-aggressive,” wrote the user. “It’s super rude if someone just sends you a thumbs up,” they added. “So I also had a weird time adjusting because my workplace is the same.”
