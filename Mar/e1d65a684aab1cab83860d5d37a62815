A  federal judge appointed by former President Trump was ambushed by about 100 student protesters and a woke diversity dean who derailed his talk at Stanford Law School and accused him of causing “harm” to students. Tirien Steinbach, the school’s associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion, subjected U.S. Circuit Judge S. Kyle Duncan to a lengthy harangue and made it clear to him his presence on campus was unwelcome, video of the event shows. “It’s uncomfortable to say this to you as a person. It’s uncomfortable to say that for many people here, your work has caused harm,” Steinbach claimed during the judge’s attempt to speak to Stanford’s chapter of the conservative Federalist Society. “This event is tearing the fabric of this community that I care about. and I’m here to support,” she hectored. “For many people at the law school who work here, who study here, and who live here, your advocacy — your opinions from the bench — land as absolute disenfranchisement of their rights.’ Steinbach, a former program officer at the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke at length about her commitment to free speech — while refusing to offer Judge Duncan an opportunity to speak. Duncan said he didn’t get far into his talk when he was interrupted — and accused the dean of being in cahoots with left-wing student comrades to derail the event. “In my view, this was a setup, she was working with students on this,” Duncan said. “It would be nice if they reached out to me and said, ‘Gee, we’re sorry,” Duncan said of Stanford. “I told [students] this is not going to work in a courtroom, this way of disagreement. Maybe that’s where we are going as a society, but that doesn’t work in my courtroom.” Steinbach did not respond to request for comment from The Post. With Post Wires
