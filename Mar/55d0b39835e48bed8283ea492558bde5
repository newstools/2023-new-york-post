Hats off to Public Advocate Jumaane Williams for proving our long-held view that New York City doesn’t remotely need his office. A Post exposé just revealed that Williams and his staff have been largely missing in action since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020. Even with the pandemic long over, they’re still working from the comfort of home — well, clocking in from home, anyway. This week, The Post found only five out of the office’s 59 employees sitting at their desks. Anyone calling for assistance gets a recorded message: “Our office is currently working remotely.” That this hasn’t caused a stir is pretty strong proof that the office is irrelevant to any public need. The public advocate position was created in the 1993 charter revision basically as an insider favor to the guy whose City Council president post was being eliminated. It’s become mainly a perch for pols seeking higher office — a launchpad that both Bill de Blasio and Tish James used successfully; Williams hasn’t had as much luck despite two statewide runs. But term limits won’t force Williams out until 2029, giving him lots of time to safely chase other offices, like a primary challenge to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand next year, another run at Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2026 or a bid for a state Senate seat or somesuch. Maybe all three: It’s not like he has to waste any time working his day job to collect his pay. But the office costs taxpayers $5 million a year, and the February 2019 special election that installed Williams (after James moved up to state attorney general) cost taxpayers $23 million — $15 million to conduct the vote and another $8 million in public funding for two dozen candidates. As we’ve said before, the office isn’t worth the endless waste of millions in public money. City Councilman Kalman Yeger (D-Brooklyn) ought to re-introduce his 2018 bill to abolish the office. That would let it be approved in a referendum this year and take effect in 2025. #DefundJumaane.
