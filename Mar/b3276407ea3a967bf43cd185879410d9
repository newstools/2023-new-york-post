Here are some nuggets from Metsâ€™ spring training on Tuesday: Brett Baty came off the bench and delivered an RBI single for the Mets in their 8-4 loss to the Astros at Clover Park. The rookie Baty, who homered in his first plate appearance of the spring, is 4-for-7 (.571) in the exhibition season. T.J. McFarland allowed three earned runs on three hits in the eighth inning. The lefty reliever surrendered homers to Jordan Brewer and Cesar Salazar. Will Wagner, whose father Billy pitched for the Mets, saw action at third base for the Astros and went 0-for-2. Will Wagner, 24, spent most of last season at Double-A. Tylor Megill will receive his first start of the Grapefruit League season when the Mets play the Marlins in Jupiter, Fla.
