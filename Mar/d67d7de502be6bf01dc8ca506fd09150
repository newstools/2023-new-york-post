PORT ST. LUCIE — Edwin Diaz’s participation in the World Baseball Classic for Puerto Rico will include constraints. Among them is an agreement the Mets’ star closer won’t pitch on consecutive days, Diaz said Thursday. Diaz and Mets brass reached that decision based on where the right-hander is in his buildup for the season. “We don’t throw back-to-back here until late March,” said Diaz, who will leave Monday to join Team Puerto Rico in Miami. “I understand that and am OK with that. We are on the same page and ready to go.” Diaz added that he would pitch every other day if needed for Puerto Rico. If it’s not thrilling enough for Diaz to represent his country in the tournament, the presence of his brother Alexis on the team will only add to the excitement. Alexis Diaz pitched to a 1.84 ERA in 59 appearances for the Reds last season, primarily in a setup role. Edwin Diaz said he’s never played on the same team as his younger brother because of their age difference. Edwin will turn 29 this month. Alexis is 26. Edwin Diaz’s dream is to save a game for Puerto Rico after his brother has pitched the eighth inning. “I think that will happen,” Edwin Diaz said. “We have got three or four closers and all those guys won’t pitch the same day, so me and [Alexis] can pitch the same day and the other two closers can go the other day. That would be really good.”
