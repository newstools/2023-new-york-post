She’s mastered aging. “I Dream of Jeannie” star Barbara Eden, 91, stepped out Wednesday in a rare public sighting for an event from Marcel Remus Real Estate held at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Eden showed off her enviable figure in a silk navy blouse, black slacks, black heels and dazzling dark gem jewelry. Her lip gloss shimmered and lashes fluttered as she flashed smiles while strutting on the red carpet. Eden told Page Six in 2021 that she frequented the gym, took spin classes and lifted weights until about 2018. She said she started having a trainer come to her house for resistance work and walks around her tennis court, but admitted that the pandemic interrupted her workout routine. The Hollywood glamour gal is best known for playing a genie discovered in a bottle by an astronaut (the late Larry Hagman) in “I Dream of Jeannie,” which aired from 1965 to 1970. She even hit her legendary genie pose on Wednesday’s red carpet, holding her arms out and crossing them fingers to elbows. The Hollywood Walk of Fame star recipient appeared on “Dallas,” “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” and “How To Marry a Millionaire,” among scores of other projects. She even competed on “Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition” in 2016, going home on the second episode. Eden told Closer Weekly in 2021 that she’s “very careful” about her diet. “I’m a carnivore … I like steak. We eat a lot of pork, chicken, steak [and] vegetables,” she revealed, while noting she also has a sweet tooth. “I like dessert. I like gumdrops. Those are fun.” She credits her youthful glow to her go-to cream from Estée Lauder. “They have [serum] drops [called] line repair. I use that morning and night,” Eden said. “I also use sunscreen. I don’t go out without sunscreen … but I don’t wear makeup unless I’m working.”
