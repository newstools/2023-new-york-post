The US Air Force fired six officers, including two commanders, from their positions at a key nuclear base in North Dakota on Monday for failing to do their jobs. Maj. Gen. Andrew Gebara, commander of the 8th Air Force, relieved the officers from their jobs at the Minot Air Force Base “due to a loss of confidence in their ability to complete their assigned duties,” according to a news release. Gebara fired the commanders of the 5th Mission Support Group and the 5th Logistics Readiness Squadron from their positions of leadership. Four subordinate leaders were also let go by Minot officials. “These personnel actions were necessary to maintain the very high standards we demand of those units entrusted with supporting our Nation’s nuclear mission,” Gebara said. The Air Force Global Strike Command refused to name the officers who had been relieved of duty or provide more details on what led to their dismissals. The commanders and their subordinates were reportedly let go after their units failed an inspection that tested whether the nuclear weapon stockpile at the base was safe and secure at all times, two defense officials told CNN. The Mission Support Group cares for base facilities, infrastructure and troops, while the Logistics Readiness Squadron plans deployments and manages supply chains. The Minot base houses both ballistic missile silos and strategic bombers, making it a key factor in the US’ nuclear power supply. “Eighth Force continues to safeguard global combat power and conduct around-the-clock strategic deterrence operations in a safe, secure and effective manner,” Gebara said. “Our mission is foundational to our Nation’s defense, and we remain committed to the success of that no-fail mission.”
