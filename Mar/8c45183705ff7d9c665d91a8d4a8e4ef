“Choo” on this! A train station that has been converted into a house — and comes with its own locomotive and private train track — has hit the market for $588,800. Known as the Saughtree Station in Newcastleton, Scotland, the property was converted in the 1990s to residential by its current owner. The station itself dates back to 1867. Made up of six bedrooms and six bathrooms, the unique property boasts panoramic nature-heavy views. In front of the home is the old railway track and former railway line, which still operates as a private railway. But most of all, the buyer will get a Ruston diesel shunter train, two wagons and a guard’s van. Occupying nearly 3,000 square feet, the home is built with stone and features two living areas — with a sitting room doubling up a dining space with a rustic woodburning fireplace. A bedroom wing is located off the siting room with its own bathroom. And what was an old ticket office up a small flight of steps from the main hallway is now used as a study, with two additional bedrooms. In the center of the home is the kitchen, which overlooks a garden. And on the opposite side of the house are three more bedrooms and bathrooms. Outdoor amenities include an expansive lawn with open hill views, a terrace and an outdoor dining space. “This is one of the most unique properties I have come across,” Andrew Thomson, who holds the listing with Savills, said in a statement. “It must be one of the only properties available in recent years with an opportunity to also purchase a working private railway and diesel locomotive.”
