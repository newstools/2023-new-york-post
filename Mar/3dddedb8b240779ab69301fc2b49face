Sports betting is now live in Massachusetts and in-state residents can grab the FanDuel Massachusetts promo code that allows new customers to place a $5 bet to get $200 in bonus bets! If you’re from elsewhere, you can get the regular new customer offer from FanDuel that gives new customers $200 in bonus bets, aka bet credits, with just a $20 first bet. Bonus bets can be used to make profits on winning bets, but they can’t be withdrawn from the sportsbook and deposited in a bank account. So if you used $40 in bonus bets on the Celtics at +120 and they win, you would profit $48. If they lost, the bonus amount wagered is gone but you wouldn’t lose any actual money.

For those not in Massachusetts, the regular FanDuel promo code gives new users $200 in bet credits with just a $20 first bet. If you use the promo codes on a losing wager, that money is still returned back as bet credits. Two NBA teams fighting for their playoff lives take the floor tonight in Atlanta when the Hawks host the Minnesota Timberwolves. FanDuel Sportsbook favors the Hawks by 5.5 points and that just feels a bit too high. Yes, Atlanta has home court, but both of these teams are 34-34 and I don’t see a six-point difference between them in a given game. The Hawks are once again a good offensive team, ranking second in the Eastern Conference at 117.3 points per game, but their defense basically allows the same amount. Trae Young is having another great season with 26.8 PPG and 10.1 APG, while Dejounte Murray and De’Andre Hunter contribute in supporting roles. Minnesota has gone through a bumpy season with Karl-Anthony Towns getting injured, but they’ve been able to stabilize and get in position to compete for the playoffs. Anthony Edwards is having another outstanding season and leads the team with 24.8 PPG. Ultimately, these teams look fairly similar, so I don’t see why Atlanta is a 5.5-point favorite. Except this to be a closer game and take the Timberwolves to cover with the FanDuel Massachusetts promo code. Already signed up at FanDuel?
