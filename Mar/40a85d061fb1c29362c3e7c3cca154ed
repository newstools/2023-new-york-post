Yale is looking to repeat as the Ivy League champs, but first they need to get past Cornell. Here’s why they might have a tough time making that happen. Gametime: 11 a.m. ET TV: ESPNU Live Stream: ESPN+, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The Big Red nearly played their way out of this tournament by losing five of their past seven games, but the Ivy League’s best offense is a dangerous opponent with a clean slate. The reigning champs carry all the pressure and less confidence away from home, where Yale dropped three league games. Cornell can’t expect to go 13-for-27 on 3-pointers — as it did in a 94-82 win over the Bulldogs on Jan. 13 — but the elite outside shooting of leading scorers Greg Dolan and Nazir Williams will keep the outcome in suspense until the final minute.
