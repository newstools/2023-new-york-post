James Hong brought a piece of “Everything Everywhere All At Once” to the Oscars red carpet. Hong, 94, walked the champagne-colored carpet wearing a bowtie with googly eyes — an ode to the movie. He portrays Gong Gong in the film, the father of Michelle Yeoh’s character, Evelyn Quan Wang. Googly eyes play a big role in “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — and might have even caused a shortage at Michaels arts stores. Yeoh’s character initially is annoyed at her husband’s obsession with sticking googly eyes everywhere and rejects all his attempts to bring joy and humor into their lives. But Evelyn ends up growing an appreciation toward them, putting one on her forehead during the film’s climactic fight scene. The googly eyes represent existentialism and the human desire to create meaning in their lives. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” has been cleaning up in the 2023 awards season, with 11 Oscar nominations and winning two Golden Globe Awards.
