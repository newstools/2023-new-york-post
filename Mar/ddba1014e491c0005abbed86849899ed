PORT ST. LUCIE — Both the Mets and Team USA have been dealt an injury blow, though it does not sound as if it is catastrophic. Brooks Raley, a Mets lefty who was pitching with the United States in the World Baseball Classic, has been removed from Team USA after experiencing tightness in his left hamstring. Raley has a low-grade hamstring strain, the Mets said Saturday, and he will return to Port St. Lucie for spring training. The Mets did not release a timeframe for his return to action with Opening Day under three weeks away. Such injuries often can keep pitchers out for a few weeks. Former Met and current Angels lefty Aaron Loup replaced Raley on the Team USA roster after Raley threw a scoreless inning in an exhibition against the Angels on Thursday. The Mets traded with the Rays for Raley in December, with the 34-year-old serving as a replacement for Joely Rodriguez in the bullpen. The Mets are short on southpaws: Raley previously was the only lefty expected to break camp with the major league bullpen. David Peterson and Joey Lucchesi could, but both are being stretched out as starters. Manager Buck Showalter has mentioned David Robertson could be an option against tough lefty batters. The righty held lefties to a .550 OPS last season.
