The 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) recently showcased game-changing tech gadgets for work-from-home life. With a projected 36.2 million Americans working remotely in 2025, workers are finding they’re more productive getting their work done from home. Staying productive is essential for the work from home lifestyle, but a cluttered workspace can minimize your productivity. Get organized and protect your workspace with the magnetic Desk Mat Pro which also includes two cable block managers. This CES-featured desk mat bundle is now just $49.99 (reg. $59.95) until March 5. Organization is critical to helping you stay on task and complete your best quality of work. Fit your laptop or monitor, keyboard, mouse, and beverages on the 31” by 16” Desk Mat Pro. The PU pebble leather surface creates an elegant vibe for your workspace while also protecting it from scratches and spills. The bottom is made with naturally water-resistant faux suede that makes cleaning simple and easy. Magnetically secure your charging cables to the metal infused desk mat with the included cable blocks. These silicone blocks have strong magnets and weights on their bottoms to keep your cords from dropping to the ground. Fit virtually any size cable into the blocks and place them anywhere on the mat to completely customize your workspace. By protecting your desk’s top surface, you may be increasing the longevity of its use. The Desk Mat Pro helps you avoid water rings from your beverages and scratches occurring as you focus on work.
