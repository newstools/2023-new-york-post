I’ll have what she’s having. A wedding planner on TikTok shared a menu at a recent wedding featuring a raunchy typo that probably had people reconsidering their choice of appetizer. The menu showed two options under the “To start” section: “Chargrilled quail, local hunter valley sticky bbq marinade, petite egg noodle salad, jus” and aged bresaola, which is where the typo comes in. The description was supposed to say that the meat came with duck liver pate — but there was an “i” where the “u” should be, thus spelling out “dick liver pate.” “This is why you need to double, triple, quadruple check everything,” wedding planner Ria wrote on the TikTok video, which has racked up 82,200 likes and 5.8 million views. She added in the caption, “Mistakes happen.” People were in hysterics over the typo in the comments, adding on to the joke. “I wanna know who’s having seconds,” someone said. “That’s the honeymoon menu,” another quipped. “that probably is made for the singles table only at the wedding,” one person commented. “I’ll take two for here, and three to go please! Thank you,” someone else joked. “There’s a typo in ‘liver.’ The ‘i’ should be an ‘o'” a user suggested. “Was it served with the white sauce?” someone laughed. “If you order it, it will come out fast, but you’ll have to wait 45 minutes for a second serving,” another joked.
