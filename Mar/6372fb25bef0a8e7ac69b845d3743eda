Alec and Hilaria Baldwin’s Hamptons home just received another price slash. It’s now down to $22.5 million. The Amagansett farmhouse, at 335 Town Lane Road, was last asking $24.9 million — down from its original $29 million ask last June. Last month, New Mexico prosecutors downgraded the charges against Baldwin to involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film “Rust” in October 2021. The 18th-century property is where the Baldwins and their six kids — there are now seven — spent the pandemic; Alec also has daughter Ireland Baldwin with his ex-wife, Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger. Baldwin bought the traditional, shingled two-story home for $1.75 million back in 1996 and has since expanded it. It’s now 10,000 square feet — featuring four bedrooms, five baths, two powder rooms, along with a wood-paneled library and a screening room. The property sits on 10 acres, overlooking an agricultural reserve. Outside, there’s a custom pavilion with a fieldstone fireplace, a pool, a spa, a vegetable garden and approved plans to expand the home by 1,200 square feet — and even potentially build private stables on the reserve. The spread also comes with different legends. In one, it was first built in 1753 as a modest “saltbox” that was converted into a larger home in the 1790s, and then moved nearby to its current location — then remodeled around 1913 by architect Joseph Greenleaf Thorp, of Grey Gardens fame. However, developer Jeffrey Collé, who restored the home for Baldwin, once told Curbed Hamptons that it was completed between 1697 and 1792, then moved across frozen fields by oxen in 1756 — while the current listing dates the home’s origin to 1740.
