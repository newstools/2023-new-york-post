The Cardinals are out for blood this season. After a 2-0 defeat at the hands of the Phillies in the 2022 National League Wild Card Series, Oliver Marmol’s squad is hungrier than ever to bring postseason glory back to St. Louis. When you have a roster made up of veteran stars like Paul Goldschmidt, Nolan Arenado, Jack Flaherty, Willson Contreras and Adam Wainwright, that shouldn’t be too tall an order. “We set out to win a World Series,” Marmol said to a local NBC affiliate. And if you want to cheer the team on this season at Busch Stadium, you can and for cheap. At the time of publication, we found tickets going for as low as just $2 before fees on Vivid Seats. That’s cheaper than a beer at the ballpark (a 16-ounce draft will run you $9.25 as of 2019). Not a bad deal to see one of the best teams in the big leagues. Plus, you can even score a Nolan Arenado or Ryan Helsley bobblehead if you choose the right game. As for those traveling overseas this summer, make sure to stop by London on June 24 and June 25 too — the Redbirds will be playing the Cubbies at London Stadium on those days. All that being said, if you want to see the Cardinals in person this season at home (or in a different continent), here’s everything you need to know. A complete calendar including dates, start times, opponents and cheapest tickets available for all Cardinals home games can be found below.

After a spat with umpire C.B. Bucknor in August 2022, the pair revived their antagonistic relationship at a recent spring training game. What happened?
