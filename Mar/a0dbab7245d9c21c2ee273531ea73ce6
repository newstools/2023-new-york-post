Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Thursday: Brett Baty’s bat continues to live up to expectations, as the third baseman drove in the Mets’ first run with a single in the bottom of the ninth in a 6-2 loss to the Braves at Clover Park. He’s now 6-for-11 (.545) this spring. Mets pitchers allowed seven walks, though Buck Showalter said Carlos Carrasco and Drew Smith pitched well. Eduardo Escobar made his first appearance in left field this spring, as he prepares to play the position for Team Venezuela in the WBC. “He’s taking it seriously,” Showalter said. Max Scherzer gets the start against the Nationals at Clover Park at 1:10 p.m. Francisco Alvarez is scheduled to catch for the first time since undergoing ankle surgery in the offseason.
