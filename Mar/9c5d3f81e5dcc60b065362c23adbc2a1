LeBron James’ son Bronny, already a captivating NBA draft prospect, has been rounding into one of the best high school players in the country. A senior at Sierra Canyon High School, he is currently ranked No. 28 in the ESPN 100 for the 2023 senior class. In a match-up against Etiwanda in the CIF Southern California Regional Division 1 playoffs, James paced the team with a squad-high 21 points in front of his famous father, who sat front row in a walking boot due to a foot injury that will sideline him for at least a few weeks. Sierra Canyon won, 61-55, and will enter the regional championship game on Saturday and  LeBron shouted out his eldest son’s special performance. “Bronny you were SPECIAL tonight kid!!” the Lakers star tweeted. “Keep going!” He added a series of emojis as well as the hashtag “AlwaysProudDad.” It’s still unknown what path James will take for the 2023-24 season prior to presumably entering the NBA Draft. League rules mandate that players must be one year removed from their high school graduating class before jumping into the NBA, but for Bronny, he’ll have options beyond spending a lone season in college. According to 247 Sports, James reportedly has offers from Memphis, Ohio State and USC, while ESPN included Kentucky, Oregon and Michigan. It’s also been rumored that James could also consider the G League Ignite route, and Australia’s NBL is also reportedly recruiting Bronny to forego college until playing in the NBA.
