It was no laughing matter. Comedian Pete Davidson drove into the side of a house in Beverly Hills Saturday night with his actress girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders riding shotgun, police confirmed to The Post. Davidson was behind the wheel of a Mercedes “driving at a high rate of speed” around 11 p.m. when he jumped a curb in the Flats neighborhood, according to TMZ, which first reported the incident. The “Saturday Night Live” alum ran down a fire hydrant and skidded across the front lawn before slamming into the corner of the house, according to the outlet. The siding on one corner of the house was broken and pushed inward, according to photos of the damage obtained by the site. Beverly Hills police confirmed to The Post that the car crash occurred and damaged city property — the fire hydrant — and that reports including Davidson’s involvement were accurate. A police spokesperson, however, refused to provide further details as the department’s investigation is ongoing. Sources told TMZ that drugs and alcohol are not believed to have been a factor. No one was injured in the wreck. Davidson and Sui-Wonders, who both starred in the horror-comedy film “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” had just returned from a vacation in Hawaii together.
