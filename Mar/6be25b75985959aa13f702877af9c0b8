Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Friday: Tomas Nido, who is off to a nice start in camp, singled to right field. The catcher is 6-for-18 with a home run in his first six Grapefruit League games. As he left the mound following the top of the first inning, Justin Verlander had a long talk with home-plate umpire C.B. Bucknor. Verlander found the mound wet and wanted to kick the dirt to ensure he didn’t slip, but the pitch clock was running. Bucknor said he wasn’t sure how best to address the matter, but told Verlander to call timeout and explain the situation. “Common sense, I think, is one of those things that we need to fall back on quite a bit,” Verlander said about the new rules. Hard-throwing righty Sam Coonrod touched 99.2 mph, struck out one and threw his fourth scoreless inning of the spring. Kodai Senga will make his second start of the spring when the Mets play the Nationals at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach, Fla.
