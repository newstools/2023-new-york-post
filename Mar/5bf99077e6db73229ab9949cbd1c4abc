Daniel Jones Watch appears as if it will go all the way to the 4 p.m. franchise-tag deadline. Talks between the Giants and their starting quarterback are “going right down to the wire,” a source told ESPN’s Adam Schefter Tuesday afternoon, less than three hours before the deadline. If the two sides cannot strike a deal by 4 p.m., the Giants will place the franchise tag on the 25-year-old Jones and immediately lose $32.4 million in salary cap space. Jones’ new agents with Athletes First talked with the Giants during the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis last week and met with the club again in New Jersey on Monday. Jones recently switched agencies, dropping CAA. After a season in which he led the Giants to the playoffs and established himself as the team’s answer at quarterback, Jones was initially seeking at least $45 million per season. Jones threw for 3,205 yards, 15 touchdowns and five interceptions during the 2022 regular season, while running for 708 yards and seven rushing touchdowns.
