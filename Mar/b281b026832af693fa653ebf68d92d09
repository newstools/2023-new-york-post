Model Veronica Bielik is grateful to be back in her own personal paradise. In a post shared Monday on Instagram, Bielik — who has been linked to former Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury since 2020 — detailed how much Tenerife, which is the largest of the Canary Islands, means to her. “It feels good to be back,” the travel enthusiast began. “Last time I spent 9 days alone in Tenerife, meditating, journaling and exploring the island in my tiny rented car. It was middle of pandemic and I couldn’t handle my anxiety well so I booked a one way ticket to Tenerife and switched of [sic] my phone for most of the days.” Bielik added how her nine days in solitude enabled her “to be more present and enjoy all the small moments.” “I could just sit for hours, watch the waves and first time in my life feel good in my own company,” she penned. In addition to the message, Bielik posted a trio of sun-kissed photos from her balcony, where she modeled a beige bikini and a matching sarong. Prior to her trip to Tenerife, Bielik spent time in Thailand, where Kingsbury reportedly retreated to after he was fired by the Cardinals as head coach in January following a disappointing 4-13 campaign. Kingsbury spent the past four seasons in Arizona and amassed a record of 28-37-1. The 43-year-old Kingsbury returned from Thailand last month to interview with the Texans for the offensive coordinator role on new head coach DeMeco Ryans’ staff, NFL Network reported at the time. Houston went on to hire 49ers assistant Bobby Slowik, who spent the last season as San Francisco’s offensive passing game coordinator.
