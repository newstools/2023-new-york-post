Braxton Berrios is onto the next chapter. The scrappy wide receiver’s time with the Jets is set to come to a close after the sides were unable to come to terms on a contract restructuring. “Thank you New York! Man what a wild 4 years it’s been,” he wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday. “I couldn’t imagine a better place to play and people to share these memories with. From a cast off to an All-Pro-I’ve grown so much and have an immense amount to be thankful for.” Berrios, who star rose during his four seasons with Gang Green — he was an All-Pro as a kickoff returner in 2021 — signed a two-year, $12 million contract before the 2022 season, though his $8.232 million cap number for 2023 was too high for the Jets. His release will save the team $5 million in cap space, not an insignificant amount as the team continues to explore a trade for Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Berrios finishes his time with the franchise racking up 107 receptions for 1,085 yards and five touchdowns through the air, while totaling 767 yards as a punt returner and adding 1,667 yards and a touchdown on kickoffs. The 27-year-old, a 2018 draft pick by the rival Patriots, went on to thank the Johnson family, Joe Douglas and the front office, while understanding the business side of the decision. “Thank you for giving me a chance 4 years ago,” Berrios wrote. “I hate we couldn’t work this one out but I’m so grateful for the career you’ve allowed me to build here in New York.” Even as the beau of model and influencer Sophia Culpo finds a new home, he has big hopes for his former teammates — and nothing but love for Jets fans. “This team is on the right track,” he added. “Jets Nation will absolutely be missed. You guys (and girls) are diehards and your impact was always felt.”
