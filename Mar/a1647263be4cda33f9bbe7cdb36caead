Former Cy Young winner Trevor Bauer, who’d been hit with one of the biggest suspensions in MLB history for domestic violence, is signing with the Yokohama Bay Stars, The Post has confirmed. Bauer’s deal — worth up to $4 million including incentives — is expected to be announced Monday night after his physical is done. Bauer’s deal will not offset the $22.5 million the Dodgers are to pay this season, meaning he will make up to $26.5 million. Bauer never received significant MLB interest following his reinstatement by an arbitrator. The arbitrator cut his initial two-year ban to 194 games, making him eligible to sign with any team since he had already sat out the 2022 season under suspension for domestic violence. There were differing opinions within the game whether someone in MLB would take a chance on Bauer following the ugly allegations, but the potential field was thought mostly limited to winning teams with limited media markets, which is a small group. Obviously none of those teams ultimately decided to take a chance as he’s apparently viewed as toxic. Bauer visited with Yokohama in 2019, so a relationship already existed. Many of the details of Bauer’s case never became public and are under seal, but teams by and large decided it wasn’t worth the publicity hit. The details that became public were seen as repulsive by many, although importantly, courts threw out any potential criminal case. He previously signed a then-record $102 million, three-year deal with the Dodgers two years ago. The Mets offered a similar deal but Bauer decided he wanted to go home. The Dodgers released him after his ban was lifted. He was quoted saying Dodgers people wanted to bring him back following a meeting, but the team didn’t agree with that assessment. He hasn’t pitched since June 28, 2021.
