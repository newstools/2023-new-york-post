Brian Daboll did not plan on making any, or many changes to his coaching staff but he had to bring in reinforcements when other teams hired away a few of his Giants assistants. There are four newcomers for the 2023 season. Jeff Nixon arrives as the running backs coach after spending the past three years with the Panthers. Nixon, with 25 years of experience (13 years in the NFL) previously worked with Daboll with the Dolphins in 2011. Steven Thomas is the new assistant special teams coach. He was the defensive quality control coach for the Lions the past four years. Chris Smith joins Daboll’s staff as an assistant offensive line coach after six seasons at the College of Holy Cross, serving as offensive coordinator in 2022. Also new to the Giants’ staff is Christian Daboll, the 22-year old son of the head coach, as an offensive assistant. He was a student coach the past three years at Penn State and before that for one year at Alabama. Daboll promoted three members of his staff to new positions. Michael Treier is now the safeties coach, Christian Jones is the assistant quarterbacks coach and Angela Baker is now an offensive assistant. Baker, the Giants’ first recipient of the Rosie Brown Minority Coaching Fellowship, was an offensive quality control coach in 2022. The Giants are coming off going 9-7-1 campaign in Daboll’s first season at the helm, reaching the postseason for the first time since 2016. Big Blue defeated the Vikings on the road in the wild-card round before falling to the Eagles and missing out on reaching the NFC Championship game. Offensive coordinator Mike Kafka and defensive coordinator Wink Martindale were both head coaching candidates this offseason, but did not end up getting hired.
