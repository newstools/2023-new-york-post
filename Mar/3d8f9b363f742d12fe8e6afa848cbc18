Derek Carr is leaning toward the Jets — slightly. The four-time Pro Bowler is looking for a new home following his release from the Raiders in February. The Panthers and Saints are seen as potential destinations for Carr, but Gang Green made an impression with the quarterback, according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler. The Jets and Carr both need each other. Gang Green is looking for a veteran signal caller on the free agency market following a quarterback-drama-filled season that included no true starter. The Jets have also been linked to Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who emerged from his darkness retreat last week. The former MVP has yet to make his playing intentions known and the Jets could wait on a potential Carr deal until a trade with Green Bay for Rodgers is off the table Carr, who notched a Pro Bowl appearance this year with 24 touchdowns and 3,522 passing yards, didn’t make the playoffs in Las Vegas with a 6-11 record. Following the underwhelming season, the former Raiders star said he preferred to test out free agency rather than be dealt out by Las Vegas. The Raiders were reportedly in trade talks with the Saints, who are looking for a new franchise quarterback after Drew Brees’ retirement. Carr signal caller exercised his contract’s no-trade clause and would not accept a trade with any team. Carr was later released by the Raiders before his massive $40.4 million contract became guaranteed before the NFL’s free agency period started, a move that made him one of the best quarterbacks on the market. Gang Green brass has met twice with Carr over the past month, the latest coming last week at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. That meeting included Jets owner Woody Johnson. Jets head coach Robert Saleh even spoke highly of the 31-year-old, saying he has an “elite mental makeup.”
