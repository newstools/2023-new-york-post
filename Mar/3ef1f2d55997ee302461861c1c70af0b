A 14-foot killer python was found dead on the side of the road in Long Island — likely yet another exotic pet that had been illegally kept, authorities say. The reticulated python — a species known as the world’s longest snake — was discovered on Valentine’s Day on the side of the road in Medford, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said in a press release. DEC officers responded and found the reptile curled up in a ball and determined it was dead. “Nothing to see here. Just your average, run-of-the-mill 14-foot reticulated python on the side of the road,’’ the state Department of Environmental Conversation wrote on Facebook, adding a photo of the reptile. The officers removed the snake from the roadway to appropriately dispose of it, officials said. As of Friday, officials were looking to identify the owner of the snake, who had apparently kept it as a pet. It wasn’t immediately clear how the reptile died. The constrictor species is native to southern Asia and feed on everything from birds to deer. A similarly shocking local reptile discovery happened Feb. 19, when a lethargic, possibly cold-shocked 4-foot-long alligator was hauled from Brooklyn’s Prospect Park Lake. The gator was being nursed back to health at the Bronx Zoo, where examinations determined that it had swallowed a 4-inch wide bathtub stopper. Officials have said the errant beast was likely an unwanted pet whose owner decided to release it in public waters.
