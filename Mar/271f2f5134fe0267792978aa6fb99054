Chef Todd English is on a roll. After opening Pappas Taverna — English’s first new restaurant in the Big Apple in 20 years, as The Post exclusively reported — the chef of Olives and Figs is opening a residents-only hot spot at the Bentley Residences in Sunny Isles, Florida. The 62-story tower, where the rapper Future is in contract to buy a $7.5 million unit with a private pool on its terrace, is slated for completion in 2027. The English deal was finalized at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, where the top chef — one of the festival’s founding chefs — hosted a wagyu tasting at the Bentley Residences’ sales gallery. The restaurant will be on the lobby level of the residential building, with views of the ocean and the pool. English will be on hand for residents-only events, like food and wine pairings and demonstrations, said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development. English says he plans on tailoring his offerings to what the residents want and will focus on a seasonal, Mediterranean-based menu. This is Bentley’s first branded residential partnership. Building amenities also include a gym, a spa, a pool, a lobby bar, a private dining room, a movie theater with seating for 14 (decked out like the interior of a Bentley), a cigar lounge, a game room and a kids’ club. There’s also the car elevator, named the “Dezervator” — Dezer himself is a known car aficionado — that brings condo owners’ cars right to their floor. The cars are parked in glass sky garages, so residents can view their prized possessions on display from their living rooms.
