There’s a lot you can get up to in the shower that doesn’t involve, well, showering. Not all of it is suitable for publication here (use your imagination), and some of it is decidedly inadvisable. For instance, Madonna once famously claimed that weeing on your feet in the shower helps to ward off athlete’s foot. While this has no real scientific basis, it is a great way to get yourself banned from the gym for life, which would definitely reduce your risk of picking up any unwanted fungus. So maybe she has a point? There’s a new, far more sanitary showering trend that’s taking over TikTok right now, which involves eating an orange in the shower. Why is this a thing? Apparently, the steam from the hot water intensifies the citrusy scent, boosting your mood and reducing stress and anxiety. Sure, you could just buy some orange-scented body wash, but that’s not going to get you as many likes. But there’s more. According to this trend’s fruity fans, eating an orange while you’re already in the process of washing yourself also negates the need for any extra clean-up afterwards. Of course, if you’re over the age of two, you’ve likely already figured out a way to eat oranges without getting juice all over yourself. Whatever your own thoughts on the practice, eating an orange in the shower is going gangbusters on social media right now, with people making all kinds of claims – it brings “unbridled joy”, and offers a “spa-like experience.” One TikToker went so far as to call it “the most liberating act of food consumption ever.”
