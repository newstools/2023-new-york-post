Paulina Gretzky gave fans a peek Friday at her recent trip to Mexico, where husband Dustin Johnson competed in LIV Golf’s season opener. In a post shared Friday on Instagram, Gretzky — the 34-year-old daughter of hockey icon Wayne Gretzky — is seen modeling a series of bikinis from Skims, Same, and Frankie’s Bikinis while lounging outdoors. Captioning the carousel of photos, “Highlights,” some of Gretzky’s nearest and dearest quickly responded to the post in the comments section. “Beautiful,” Gretzky’s mom, Janet Gretzky, replied while her BFF, Kristina Melnichenko, dropped four fire emojis. Gretzky supported Johnson, 38, during their time in Mexico as the Saudi-backed LIV Golf kicked off its sophomore season. Johnson and his 4Aces GC team, which consists of Patrick Reed, Pat Perez, and Peter Uihlein, placed second in last weekend’s event, while Bryson DeChambeau’s Crushers GC claimed the top spot. Johnson resigned from the PGA Tour last summer in favor of LIV Golf and reportedly received “around” $125 million to join the controversial tour. Gretzky, who married Johnson last April, elaborated on her husband’s decision to join LIV Golf in a recent episode of the Netflix docuseries “Full Swing.” “I don’t think Dustin would ever make a bad choice for his children and people have to understand at the end of the day, that’s who he chose this for,” Gretzky said. Johnson and Gretzky have two children together, sons Tatum, 8, and River, 5. In Johnson’s first year with LIV Golf, the former Masters champion earned over $35 million. LIV Golf’s next event kicks off on Friday, March 17, in Tuscon, Arizona. It remains to be seen if that LIV broadcast will entice more viewers following the latest TV ratings disaster.
