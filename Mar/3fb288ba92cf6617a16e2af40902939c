She may be a topless maid — but she doesn’t charge half off for her services. A woman has gone viral after revealing Monday that clients paid her more than $2,000 after cleaning five houses topless. The video was originally posted on TikTok, however, it was taken down from the site and the woman’s account was reportedly suspended. The woman, who goes by the name Sammie, said for one hour of topless cleaning she charges the occupant $300 on top of a tip. “So many of you want to know how much I make in a day as a topless maid,” said the Tampa native in her video. “Today I cleaned five houses and I charge $300 an hour. And I have a security guy who sits out in the car and waits for me just in case something happens.” According to the high-priced housekeeper, the first house she cleaned gave her a $150 tip. Sammie said that while it is not required to tip her, she says a lot of the houses do. “Second house, $300 and they gave me a $120 tip,” explained Sammie. The topless cleaner said the third and fourth houses she visited gave her a $150 and $110 tip respectively. Sammi finally noted that her fifth house gave her a hefty $200 dollar tip due to the size of the house and the fact it was “kinda dirty.” After working only five hours, Sammie said the total earning she made came out to a total of $2,230 but the woman also said that she gives her security guard 35% of what she made — about $800 — dropping her take-home pay to $1,430. “If you think you needed a sign, this is your sign,” concluded Sammi. “Topless maid cleaning service for the win.” Several of Sammie’s followers were left stunned. “I’m more impressed you cleaned 5 houses in one day,” said one person. “What’s getting cleaned,” questioned another. “I’m in the wrong job,” laughed another person. “He sat in the car and made $800! You did the work lol,” a fourth person said,
