Morgan Freeman was a presenter Sunday night at the 2023 Oscars — and viewers were left wondering why he was wearing a black glove on his left hand. While people were concerned, wearing a glove isn’t out of the ordinary for Freeman, and there’s a reason behind it. Freeman, 85, was in a serious car accident in 2008 when his car flipped multiple times on a Mississippi highway. The accident was nearly fatal and left his hand paralyzed. “They had to use the jaws of life [hydraulic cutters] to extract him from the vehicle,” a newspaper editor said in The Guardian at the time. “He was lucid, conscious. He was talking, joking with some of the rescue workers at one point.” Freeman suffered severe nerve damage and wears a compression glove to keep the blood flowing. “I suffered nerve damage and it hasn’t gotten better. I can’t move it,” he told People in 2010.
