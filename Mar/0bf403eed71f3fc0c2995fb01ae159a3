Three people were killed and three injured after multiple propane tanks exploded in a Georgia house early Saturday morning, officials said. The blast sent the Winder home up in flames just after midnight, trapping “multiple people” inside, according to Barrow County Emergency Services. “As firefighters arrived quickly, multiple explosions were going off inside the home,” Chief Alan Shuman said. The Hidden Acres Road home was quickly collapsing under the intense fire and was too dangerous for firefighters to enter immediately. Personnel fought the flames from a defensive position as explosions continued to detonate. Once the fire was under control, first responders found three dead individuals inside the home. Two other patients were taken by ambulance and another by helicopter to area hospitals, the department said. “Multiple” propane cylinders were found inside the house, which officials confirmed caused the deadly explosions. The identities of the deceased have not been released. The incident is still under investigation.
