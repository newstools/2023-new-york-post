Patriots quarterback Brian Hoyer is expected to be released by the start of the new league year on  March 15, according to multiple reports. Hoyer, 37, signed a two-year, $4 million contract last year. With Hoyer’s departure, starter Mac Jones and 2022 fourth-round pick Bailey Zappe are left on New England’s quarterback depth chart. Hoyer spent eight seasons in New England in three separate stints, growing under Tom Brady and winning his sole Super Bowl with the now-retired legend in 2018 over the Los Angeles Rams. Hoyer started one game for the Patriots during the 2022 season, playing two drives against the Packers on Oct. 2 before leaving with a concussion. From that point on, the Patriots relied on third-string rookie Zappe, who took over that loss to Green Bay before leading the team to two victories ahead of Jones’ return from an ankle sprain. Hoyer arrived in Foxborough in 2009 as an undrafted rookie after playing for Michigan State, and has been a backup for the majority of his 14-year career with seven different teams, including Arizona, Cleveland, Houston, Chicago, San Francisco and Indianapolis. Hoyer was the starter for the Browns in 2014, throwing for 3,326 yards and 12 touchdowns  while going 7-6 in 13 starts. The following year, he started 13 games for the Texans, throwing for 3,326 yards and 12 touchdowns. He started Houston’s wild-card playoff game against the Chiefs, who shut out the Texans 30-0. After the playoff disappointment, Hoyer headed to Chicago, where he was back in the second-string role. Over 76 career regular-season games and 40 starts, Hoyer has racked up 10,668 yards, 53 touchdowns and 35 interceptions while completing 59.4 percent of his passes.
