The latest contender for the mayor’s rat czar position was seen hunting the streets of Queens Wednesday. A coyote was spotted on a morning stroll through the Glen Oaks neighborhood around 7 a.m., the NYPD said. Video shows the canine calmly walking on the sidewalk along 81st Street with its head forward and ears lowered. Police said the coyote had also visited several backyards — with one resident capturing a snapshot of the canine striking a pose at the camera while heading for a hole in the fence. The carnivores — which have a penchant for small rodents like rats and squirrels — can weigh close to 50 pounds and stand over 2 feet tall but are generally afraid of humans. It’s not clear how long the animal was meandering through Queens before a bystander — who identified herself as a volunteer wildlife rescuer — happened to cross paths with the animal while she was driving through the neighborhood. She helped police corral the animal into a cage she owned before transporting it herself to the Sweet Briar Nature Center, an animal rehabilitation center in Smithtown, Long Island. The coyote was reportedly in good condition, cops said. “All Roadrunners can safely resume their regularly scheduled programming,” police quipped. Though rare, coyote spottings in the Big Apple aren’t unusual. In the fall, a coyote was spotted roaming the Riverdale section of the Bronx. “Over the last several decades coyotes have been expanding their natural range in response to ample food and open habitat,” the Parks Department told Fox News at the time. “Coyotes are living within the city limits, we are aware of coyotes living in the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan.” The Post reported in 2019 that coyote sightings across the city were surging, particularly in uptown Manhattan. The Mayor’s Animal Welfare Office and Sweet Briar Nature Center did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
