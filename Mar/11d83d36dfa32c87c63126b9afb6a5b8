There is no love lost between the Suns and Mavericks. On Sunday, the Dallas blew a second-half lead to Phoenix, thanks to a Kevin Durant go-ahead jumper. With 11 seconds left, Doncic had an opportunity to tie but missed a wide-open layup. Doncic was visibly upset at himself for missing the easy shot. After this, Devin Booker had some words for Doncic, pointing to the spot he missed from and taunting him by telling the referee it was an offensive foul by Doncic, ESPN’s Tim MacMahon tweeted. Doncic looked at Booker, saying, “Shut the f–k up.” The two would go nose-to-nose as they faced off. There was some light pushing and shoving between the two, and the referees gave both players a technical foul. After the game, Doncic poured some cold water on the altercation. “It’s a competitive game,” Doncic said. “It’s all good. Next time, just don’t wait until there’s three seconds left to talk.” This comes after 10 months after the Mavericks annihilated the Suns as underdogs in Game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals. These two teams added another layer when the two added former Nets stars Durant and Irving. Should they come to matchup in the playoffs this year, it will undoubtedly be filled with intrigue and drama.
