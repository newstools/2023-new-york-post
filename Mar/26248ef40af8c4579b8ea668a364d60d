Not everyone understands the Giants’ decision to make Daniel Jones the seventh highest-paid quarterback in the NFL. That includes Jaquan Brisker, the starting safety for the No. 32 in defensive DVOA Chicago Bears. “MVP lol… Other bruh got paid today and is trash fam. #FACTS,” Brisker said, responding to a fan bemoaning Lamar Jackson being placed on the franchise tag instead of receiving a contract extension. Giants receiver Darius Slayton didn’t mince words with Brisker, tweeting the score of the two teams’ Week 4 game, which the Giants won 20-12. Jones did struggle as a passer in that game. He completed eight passes on 13 attempts, throwing for 71 yards and zero touchdown passes. Jones left the game with an injury (and returning later after backup Tyrod Taylor got injured, too). Jones didn’t need to throw much in that game when he was on the field. The Giants rushed for 282 total yards and two touchdowns, both by Jones. Brisker had a sack of Jones in that game, but overall played one of his worst games of the season in Week 4, according to Pro Football Focus. The rookie’s Week 4 performance was his third worst of the season as the Giants torched the Bears’ run defense. Brisker played 39 snaps in run defense that week, the most on the team. Jones agreed to a massive four-year, $160 million extension on Tuesday with $82 million of it guaranteed.
