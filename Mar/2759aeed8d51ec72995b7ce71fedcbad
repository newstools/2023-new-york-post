Nearly Five. Million. Dollars. Per Day. That obscene figure is how much some 30,000 illegal immigrants cost New York City, per Mayor Adams’ emergency management honcho Zach Iscol. The ultimate two-year tab is projected to exceed $4 billion. It already hit $500 million in mid-February. And there’s every reason to think they’ll keep coming. The city has plenty of other places to spend $4.6 million a day: That’s $1.7 billion a year, after all. At some point it’ll have to rethink its promises on “welcoming migrants.” Shouldn’t the folks irate about reduced public-library hours in Brooklyn be asking questions about putting up migrants in luxe hotels? Certainly, Gotham simply can’t absorb this fiscal burden without major federal help. But Team Biden has so far sent only a measly $8 million. Which is outrageous: it’s President Biden who created this crisis. From the first day of his administration (actually, before!), he worked to wreck border security via “wave them in” policies and implicit promises of eventual de facto citizenship. Now we see the fruits. And what is Biden’s response? Nothing. He shills his joke of a “comprehensive immigration reform” plan, which would “fix” the issue by effectively legalizing the border-crossers. But he does nothing substantive on enforcement, and offers less than crumbs to help the cities the influx is overwhelming. What’s the plan here? To hope things somehow work out on their own? To wait until after his putative re-election before coming across? Or will he just stick the Big Apple with a big bill? Thinking the Democratic city will just vote for him anyway? How cynical. Biden’s indifference here is no less galling just because it’s so typical of him. But the vast human cost he’s imposing on this front makes it beyond sickening.
