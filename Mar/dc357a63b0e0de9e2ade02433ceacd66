Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Thursday: Ron Marinaccio made his Grapefruit League debut, after a careful buildup from the shin injury that ended his season last year, and struck out two in a perfect inning. Manager Aaron Boone called him “really crisp.” Non-roster reliever Tyler Danish, who pitched for the Red Sox last season, gave up three home runs and six earned runs in one-third of an inning against his former team. Taking the mound shortly after his rotation spot was seemingly solidified because of an injury to Carlos Rodon, Clarke Schmidt tossed three innings while giving up two runs. Two of his three strikeouts came on his cutter, a new pitch that could be key to his success this season, especially against left-handed hitters. Luis Severino is slated to get the start against the Tigers at 1:05 p.m. in Lakeland.
