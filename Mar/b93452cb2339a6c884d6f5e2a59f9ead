Two teenagers were shot in a corner store across from their Brooklyn high school Tuesday afternoon, cops said. The bullets flew around 2:30 p.m. at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and 36th Street in Sunset Park, striking the pair of 18-year-olds, police said. Both teens were shot in their left shoulders, cops said. They were taken to NYU Langone Brooklyn in stable condition. They are students at PS 371 Lillian L. Rashkis High School across from the store, police said. It wasn’t immediately clear if they were the intended targets. One of the victims has previously been busted for illegal gun possession, robbery and grand larceny, law-enforcement sources said. He was pinched for the gun crime in September, sources said. The second victim does not appear to have a record, police sources said. A worker at the bodega told The Post one of the teens got into a “big fight” Monday with one of their assailants. “They were shouting at each other, a loud argument,” he said Tuesday. He said the wounded teens were inside the store when someone outside shot them. “They were standing by the door when the kid came up on the side of Fourth Avenue and shot them,” the worker said. “He was wearing a mask and ran toward Fifth Avenue.” Two suspects were picked up by NYPD patrol officers on a city bus nearby, cops said. A gun was also recovered on the bus.
