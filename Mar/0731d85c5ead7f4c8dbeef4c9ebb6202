A British man allegedly raped a woman at a popular resort on the island of Majorca, then repeatedly resisted arrest and headbutted a cop, police in Spain say. Authorities said the 26-year-old suspect attacked his victim in Santa Posa, a coastal town not far from Magaluf, a party destination for European travelers to the Spanish island. The man then resisted arrest, putting up such a fight that he ended up headbutting one of the officers who had been called to the scene, according to the US Sun. A friend of the woman reported the assault to a receptionist at the resort, who then called the police around 7 p.m. Friday. The nationality of the suspect’s accuser has not been revealed. Officers with the Civil Guard arrested the man later Friday. In July, a British tourist was arrested on suspicion of rape in Magaluf, not far from where the most recent assault took place. The accuser in that case told Spanish authorities that she passed out in the man’s hotel room and later woke up to find him “on top of her.” Magaluf is considered to be a popular party destination for European travelers, especially British vacationers, though its reputation has been on the decline because of physical violence and rowdy behavior from tourists, according to the Daily Mail. Sexual-assault claims coming from such resorts have been on the rise in recent years.
