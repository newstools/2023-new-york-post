The gloves were off at the box office on Friday. On its opening night, “Creed III” fought its way to the top, taking home $22 million, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. The “Rocky” spinoff, which The Post said keeps audiences “under its spell right until the end,” marks the ninth installment in the franchise. The action flick, which is the directorial debut of its leading man Michael B. Jordan, is the first in the franchise that does not star Sylvester Stallone. It is projected to take home $36 to $40 million during its opening weekend, according to Variety. The animated action-adventure “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba — To the Swordsmith Village,” brought in over $4.1 million. It follows a boy who vows to become a demon slayer after his family is murdered. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” which was in second place last week, moved down to third, with over $3.1 million in sales. “Cocaine Bear,” which led the box office on its opening night last Friday, fell down to fourth, earning just over $3.1 million. Last weekend, the comedy, loosely based on a true story, earned $23.1 million domestically. The Christian drama “Jesus Revolution,” starring Kelsey Grammer, came in fifth with $2.2 million. The film is based on the Jesus movement that took place in California during the late 1960s.
