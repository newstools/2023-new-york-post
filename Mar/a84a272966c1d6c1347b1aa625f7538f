A 30-year-old was struggling to survive after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while riding a Citi Bike in Manhattan Sunday morning, cops said. The bicyclist was at West 51st Street and 11th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen when he was struck by the SUV, police said. A witness said the driver got out of his vehicle and looked at the injured biker, but then fled. The bicyclist was taken to Mt. Sinai-Morningside in critical condition. A police spokeswoman confirmed that the driver didn’t remain on the scene. Photos from the scene show the blue and white bike wedged under a car that it apparently came to rest under.
