Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Sunday: Gerrit Cole continued to look sharp in his second Grapefruit League start, striking out seven over 3 ¹/₃ scoreless innings while building his pitch count up to 57. Wandy Peralta gave up a three-run home run to left-handed hitter Brendan Donovan in the seventh inning. After entering the game as a defensive replacement for Harrison Bader in center field, Oswaldo Cabrera — in his first career appearance at the position — made a diving grab on a flair to right-center field in the eighth inning. “I told him Bader would have made it standing up — which actually isn’t true,” manager Aaron Boone said with a grin. “It was a heck of a play. … He’s shown us anywhere you put him on the field, he can make a play.” Clarke Schmidt is scheduled to get the start against the Red Sox for a 1:05 p.m. game at Steinbrenner Field.
