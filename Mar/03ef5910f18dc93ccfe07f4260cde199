The US government wants to seize a Southampton mansion tied to a sanctioned Russian oligarch, sell it, then give the proceeds to the Ukrainian people. Last week, on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US investigators asked a judge for permission to seize a mansion at 19 Duck Pond Lane — along with two Park Avenue condos and others on Fisher Island in Florida. Combined, the properties are worth more than $75 million — and were bought with funds sourced to Ukrainian-born Viktor Vekselberg, according to an unsealed complaint filed in the Southern District of New York. The metals, mining and energy oligarch was first sanctioned in 2018 for his role furthering Russia’s “malign activity around the globe,” the Treasury Department said at the time. Last March, Vekselberg was also part of a group whose assets were seized by the US Treasury for “enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war.” Not long after, Vekselberg’s $90 million, 255-foot superyacht, Tango, was seized in Spain at the request of the US government. The properties could be next. The feds also claim that Vekselberg — who couldn’t be reached for comment — and an associate, Vladimir Voronchenko, used the properties to launder money and evade sanctions. Prosecutors also claim that Voronchenko funneled $4 million through Vekselberg into some of the properties’ upkeep. Voronchenko, who also couldn’t be reached for comment, fled to Russia last May, shortly after he was served with a grand jury subpoena. Last month, Voronchenko was also indicted on money laundering charges, sanctions evasion and contempt. The Hamptons house, a traditional, cedar-shingled residence, was bought for $11.44 million in 2008 in cash allegedly tied to Vekselberg. The 9,200-square-foot residence was built in 1998. It comes with nine bedrooms and sits on 1.84 acres. It first hit the market for $15.99 million in the fall of 2021 and last asked $14.99 million. It features hardwood floors, five fireplaces, a chef’s kitchen, a library, a gym, a pool and a tennis court. As for the other properties, federal investigators also asked the judge for permission to seize two condos at 515 Park Ave. — the first bought for $11 million in 2008, the second for $610,000 in 2012. In Florida, they’re asking permission to seize a condo at 7183 Fisher Island Drive purchased for $6.2 million in 2010 and a penthouse at 7002 Fisher Island Drive bought for $31.2 million in 2017.
