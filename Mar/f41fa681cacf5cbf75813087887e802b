We hate to break the bad news but time machines don’t exist. Nope — not even DeLoreans. As of 2023, we’d argue the closest thing we have is live music, which can instantly transport you back to a time or place with a single sound. And this year, we’re going back to the ’80s. Over the next few months, many of the biggest acts from MTV’s heyday are touring all over North America and taking their fans back in time with them. Just a few of these huge stars hitting the road include Madonna, Guns N’ Roses, Duran Duran, B-52s, Bruce Springsteen and many, many more. In fact, over 100 more. You wouldn’t believe it but A Flock of Seagulls, Rick Springfield, Slick Rick, Kenny G and Billy Idol are all performing live over the next few months as well. With that being said, it doesn’t matter if singling along to “Like A Virgin,” “Welcome to the Jungle” or “Born In The U.S.A.” sends you back — we’ve got ‘something for everyone. Below, you’ll find a comprehensive list of 107 rock, pop, hard rock, alternative rock, new wave, R&B, hip-hop, jazz, folk, country, punk and Latin concert options to choose from. Plus, if you scroll to the bottom we have the ultimate ’80s-tastic festival. So, if you want to re-live your Gen X glory days or catch your favorite group live for the first time, here’s who you have to see and everything you need to know about each and every tour from opening acts to tour dates to how to get tickets. Now, fire up the time machine (and grab your shoulder pads, leg warmers, and gold lamé leotards while you’re at it) — we’re going back to the ’80s.
