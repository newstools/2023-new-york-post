Mike Gorman, the venerable TV voice of the Boston Celtics, revealed the reason he has been wearing an eye patch on-air. Viewers noticed Gorman’s eye patch during Monday night’s Celtics loss to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Gorman explained on “Toucher & Rich” on 98.5 The Sports Hub on Wednesday that he had a medical emergency over the weekend. “They tested me for about two or three hours. They decided I didn’t have a stroke, which is good, but I did have a detached retina,” Gorman revealed, as covered by Barrett Sports Media. “I had to be operated on within 48 hours, or I could’ve lost my eyesight forever. “I was in the emergency room Saturday night and was being operated on Monday morning.” Gorman, 77, has been calling Celtics games for more than 40 years, dating back to 1981. He scaled back his schedule this year, only calling games at home or in New York or Philadelphia. He made a self-deprecating joke about his appearance. “With all the Internet speculation, people said I was trying to look like Johnny Depp [in Pirates of the Caribbean],” Gorman said. “You know, just crazy stuff. So that’s what’s going on there, folks, if anybody cares. Everything is going to work out, though. “[Doctors] said it takes about two or three months before vision returns.” Gorman added that the situation is improving. “Each morning I wake up, it’s a little better. I wouldn’t be able to pick you guys out of a crowd because everything is all colors,” he said. “But there weren’t colors before. It was just a black curtain.” At 44-18 entering Wedneday’s clash with the Cavaliers, the Celtics are a half-game behind the 44-17 Bucks for first place in the NBA’s Eastern Conference. The Celtics are +275 to win the NBA championship according to the gambling odds on PointsBet; they are currently the favorites to win the title.
