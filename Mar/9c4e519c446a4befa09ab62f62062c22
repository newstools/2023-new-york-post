The first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft will probably be a quarterback, as it is nearly every year when the class is decent enough. But Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson left little doubt as to who the best non-quarterback prospect in the draft is with his performance on Thursday at the NFL Scouting Combine, running a blazing-fast 4.6-second 40-yard dash during his workout. It wasn’t the fastest time for an edge rusher – that honor went to Georgia’s Nolan Smith, who ran a ridiculous 4.39 and measured in at 6-foot-2 and 238 pounds. Anderson, in comparison, measured at 6-3 1/2 and 253 pounds, with his arms measured at 33 7/8 inches compared to Smith’s 32 5/8. The Crimson Tide product already came into the NFL Scouting Combine as the top edge rushing prospect, amassing 27.5 sacks and 48 tackles for loss in his final two seasons at Alabama, and his excellent speed numbers for his size only quelled whatever doubt was left. Anderson had shared the title of best defensive prospect with Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter, but Carter was arrested earlier this week for reckless driving stemming from a fatal crash that killed his teammate, Devin Willock, and Georgia staffer Chandler LeCroy. Carter returned to the Combine after turning himself in in Athens, Ga., but his draft and NFL future are up in the air, essentially locking Anderson in as the top non-QB prospect. Could he go No. 1? The Chicago Bears hold the first pick in the draft, and with Justin Fields already on the team, it seems unlikely the team would select a quarterback – making Anderson the likely choice if they stick in that spot. However, Bears GM Ryan Poles has indicated Chicago is looking to trade out of the No. 1 selection with a team that wants a quarterback, making it less likely Anderson will go atop the draft. The quarterback-needy Texans then select at No. 2, but with the Arizona Cardinals picking third and Kyler Murray in the fold, it seems unlikely that Anderson would fall past No. 3 overall.
