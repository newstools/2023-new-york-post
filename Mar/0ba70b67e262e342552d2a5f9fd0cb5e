A woman was found dead inside a car that contained an “assortment of liquid chemicals” in a ritzy Manhattan neighborhood on Sunday morning and investigators believe she killed herself, according to police. The 35-year-old woman was discovered unconscious in the backseat of a car parked at East 56th Street and Sutton Place in Midtown at around 11:20 a.m., cops said. “There was some assortment of liquid chemicals in the vehicle,” an NYPD spokeswoman said. Emergency workers donned chemical protective suits as they responded, photos showed. There were no other injuries, police said. The Office of the City Medical Examiner will determine if she ingested the chemicals, cops said.
