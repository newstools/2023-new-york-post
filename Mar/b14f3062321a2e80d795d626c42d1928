TAMPA — A day after Frankie Montas said he “wasn’t fully 100 percent” healthy when the Yankees acquired him at the trade deadline last year, general manager Brian Cashman defended the Yankees’ due diligence in evaluating the medical information available to them at that time. “I know [Wednesday] he said clearly he was hurt, but I think in terms of context, it’s easy for him to say that now, but when we got him, he said he felt great, he was feeling 100 percent and ready to go,” Cashman said on Thursday. “I feel like he was genuine and sincere. So you go through the medical deep dive that you can do in-season. “You deal with the player when you get him and how he’s feeling. Everything came back good and aces, and without concern. But it didn’t play out that way.” Montas, 29, underwent surgery last month on the labrum in his right shoulder that is expected to keep him out until at least August. He was a few weeks removed from the injured list with the Athletics when the Yankees acquired him. “I was trying to pitch through it,” Montas said Wednesday. “Of course I got traded to a new team, I wanted to show what I can do. “Things didn’t go the way I was expecting. But I’m here to try to help this team and go out there and show what I can really do when I’m healthy.” Montas made eight starts for the Yankees last season, recording a 6.35 ERA before going back on the IL with the same shoulder inflammation he experienced previously. He then felt more discomfort during the offseason that led to the surgery. “This was a thing I had to take care of,” Montas said of the surgery. “I don’t have control of it. Of course, trust me, I’m one of the guys that wants to be out there pitching right now and showing what I can do.
