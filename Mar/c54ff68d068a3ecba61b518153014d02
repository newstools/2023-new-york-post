An unhinged assailant randomly whacked a straphanger with a piece of metal in a Lower Manhattan subway station this week, authorities said. Wilbert Cueva-Rioja, 52, was on the stairwell at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station around 6:20 a.m. Wednesday when the stranger approached him from behind and struck him in the head with the metal slab, cops said. Cueva-Rioja, a Peruvian immigrant and father of two, said he was heading to his daughter’s immigration appointment when he felt the whack on the back of his head. “He approached me from the back and hit my head. I just moved but couldn’t do anything else. I was about to fall down but put my hand over my head,” he told The Post in Spanish as his niece translated. “I pushed the guy and he tried to take my wallet. When the guy was trying to get the wallet out, he scratched my face,” he said. Other subway riders started yelling at the attacker, who then ran off, Cueva-Rioja said. The assailant chillingly didn’t say a word during the attack, Cueva Rioja said. Cueva Riojas was taken to Bellevue Hospital to be treated for cuts to his head. On Friday he said his arm is still sore and still has a scar on his face and a gash on his head. “Since I got hit in the head, I haven’t been feeling the same,” he said. NYPD released a photo of the suspect late Thursday but no arrests have been made. Since the incident he’s suffered from dizziness, forcing him to miss several days of work at a Bronx fish market, causing him financial stress. Cueva-Rioja, who has lived in the city for 14 years, said this is the second time he’s been attacked on the subway system after he was robbed in 2021. “This is the second time this happened. Three young guys robbed me in the Bronx. They robbed my phone,” he said, adding that he never filed a police report. “It’s become so dangerous,” he said about the city. “Before it wasn’t like that.” “New York City is becoming a dangerous place to live.”
