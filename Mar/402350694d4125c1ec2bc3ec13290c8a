At least 464 Ukrainian children have been killed by Russian attacks across the country since the invasion a year ago, according to data from the country’s national police force. The Ukraine Office of the Prosecutor General wrote on its Telegram channel recently that an additional 934 children were wounded in the war. The prosecutor’s office said that the highest number of wounded children — at least 445 — came from the Eastern Donetsk region, where Ukraine and Russian forces are locked in a grinding battle for the key city of Bakhmut. At least 272 children were wounded in the Kharkiv region in the northeast of the country and another 123 have been injured in the northern central Kyiv region, according to the prosecutor. At least 367 children are also missing, according to data from Ukraine’s Children of War website, which is maintained by the country’s Ministry of Reintegration and National Information Bureau and uses data from the national police. Ukraine has also said that thousands of children have been forcibly taken to Russia, where they are kept in “reeducation camps,” and sometimes adopted and made Russian citizens. Russian airstrikes have also damaged 3,126 schools and educational buildings and 438 of them have been completely destroyed, the prosecutor said.
