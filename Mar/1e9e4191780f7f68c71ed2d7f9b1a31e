The Jets players who have been clamoring for Aaron Rodgers to become their teammate have begun celebrating. Wide receiver Garrett Wilson and running back Breece Hall took to Twitter on Monday afternoon to celebrate the idea that Rodgers could potentially become the next quarterback of the Jets “Y’all shud see this smile on me rn,” Wilson tweeted with a tears emoji. “I can finally enjoy my vacay now,” he wrote in a separate tweet. Hall tweeted moments later, “The Cheese Head did it,” referencing the bonfire where Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner torched an actual cheese head. The Jets players reactions came shortly after a tweet from Trey Wingo, who reported: “Hearing Rodgers to the Jets is done. History about to repeat itself between New York and Green Bay. Time is indeed a flat circle.” Nevertheless, there has not been confirmation that Rodgers has made his final decision. And while Adam Schefter said Monday afternoon on ESPN that there are “mounting indications” Rodgers will be a Jet, he cautioned that the quarterback has not informed the Jets or Packers of that news as of yet. It is unclear whether the Jets players are privy to information the public does not yet have, or if they were reacting to Wingo’s tweet on the matter. If Rodgers does not wind up on the Jets, this moment in social media history could be likened to a player who prematurely celebrates before reaching the end zone, only to fumble the ball before finishing the score. Should the Jets fail to land Rodgers, their options at quarterback are dwindling.

Lamar Jackson could be available but it would be a steep price. In addition to the money he would command, the Jets would need to send the Ravens two first-round picks under the conditions of the transition tag they placed on Jackson.
