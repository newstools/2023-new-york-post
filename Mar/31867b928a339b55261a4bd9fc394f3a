Apparent human remains — possibly a hand — were found by a man walking his dog on Staten Island, police said Friday. The remains were found about 2:40 p.m. Thursday around the intersection of Amboy and Cunningham roads near North Mount Loretto State Forest, cops said. Police could not confirm exactly what the remains were, but NBC reported they appeared to be a human hand. The NYPD was awaiting the city medical examiner to determine what was found.
