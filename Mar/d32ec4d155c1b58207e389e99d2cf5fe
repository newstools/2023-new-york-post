Veteran Patriots safety Devin McCourty plans on hanging it up. McCourty announced the news on Friday, following a successful 13-season career that includes three Super Bowl championships. The 35-year-old, who said he may make the jump to sports media, said he talked with Patriots brass about the decision and thinks it “is the best decision for me.” “I’m officially retiring from the NFL. It has been a great ride,” McCourty said on Instagram. “I think it’s always tough to come to the end.” McCourty entered the NFL in 2010 out of Rutgers before playing 205 regular-season games for New England, which is the fifth most in franchise history. He was also an impressionable leader throughout his career and was named captain during his second season. The safety held down the Patriots’ secondary, starting in every game he played in. He made 982 tackles and recorded 35 interceptions throughout his career – the third most in franchise history. McCourty started in the most playoff games (24) of any defensive back in NFL history. He stated his greatest career highlight, though, is teaming up with his brother in 2018 to win a Super Bowl together. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick gushed about the safety in a statement, saying he’s excited to bring the traits he brought on the field to the next chapter of his life. “It is a rare group of players who win games at a historic rate, exude team culture, lead, win awards, and win championships. And then there is Devin McCourty,” Belichick said. “Devin did all of those things as a player and more. But, what I think of first when I think of Devin is the type of man he is, his character, his values and how high he raised the bar for spreading goodness and justice in the community. “For 13 years, Devin made everyone in our organization feel better and be better because of who he is — a pillar of professionalism, unselfishness, work ethic, preparation, intelligence and performance.”
