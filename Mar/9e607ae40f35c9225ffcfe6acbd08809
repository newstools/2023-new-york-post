A man was stabbed during a bar fight in Queens early Sunday — one of at least four people wounded in knifings across the city this weekend, cops said. The 46-year-old victim was injured after he and another person got into a brawl at the Cañas Restaurant and Bar in Jamaica around 12:45 a.m., an NYPD spokesman said. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition. His opponent ran off. In a separate incident also in Queens, a 57-year-old man was stabbed in his stomach, arm and leg on a residential block of 60th Avenue near Lawrence Street just before midnight Sunday. The victim was taken to Booth Memorial Hospital in critical condition, cops said. The suspect was wearing a mask and fled on foot. The motive was unknown, cops said. Also on Saturday night, two men were knifed in East Harlem in Manhattan, cops said. A 28-year-old was stabbed once in the head and a 34-year-old was slashed in the neck at East 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. Both were taken to Harlem Hospital in stable condition. There was no description of a suspect and no known motive, cops said.
