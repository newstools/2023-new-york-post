A 14-year-old died after he fell between subway cars in the Bronx on Friday night, police said. The teenager was riding a northbound No. 5 train when he possibly slipped while moving between two train cars near the East 180th street station, police said. He was declared dead at the scene, cops said. Police are looking for witnesses and surveillance footage to see if the boy had climbed up on top of the train and was “subway surfing” when he fell, sources said. The East 180th street station is an elevated, outdoor station. The teen’s death comes just days after a 15-year-old boy was killed while subway surfing on the Williamsburg Bridge. The teen was riding on the roof of a northbound J train heading across the bridge when he slammed his head on a part of the structure around 6:45 p.m. on Monday, according to police. He fell beneath the train and was pronounced dead at the scene. The teen’s grieving mother told The Post on Friday that she plans to sue the MTA for failing to block off empty parts of the train used for the trending daredevil stunt. The MTA said in a statement to the Post that, “Riding outside subway cars is dangerous and against the rules, and we won’t comment on pending litigation.”
