Spring break season is officially upon us. Whether you’re jetting off to Aruba, Jamaica, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Key Largo, Montego, the Florida Keys, Martinique, Port Au Prince, or some destination not named on the Beach Boy’s seminal 1988 hit “Kokomo,” you’re going to need a suitcase. This year, however, instead of just buying one new high-quality suitcase to refresh your travel gear, why not pick up three, for the price of one, or more accurately, the price of six. This week, Walmart is offering this Zimtown Three-Piece Nested Spinner Suitcase Luggage Set for more than half off, at just $115, down from $300. Travel in style and security with this hard-sided, water-resistant luggage set, complete with a TSA-approved lock, to ensure your valuables stay safe and sound on the long journey to any of the myriad travel destinations named checked by Mike Love and the gang. Enjoy savings of over 60% off, and grab three matching suitcases for yourself and your travel companions, all with push-button handles, 360-degree spinner wheels, and more than enough space for sunscreen. Much like flights, it’s best to act fast when buying the bestselling Zimtown 3-Piece Nested Spinner Suitcase Luggage Set. Like vacation, this deal won’t last forever, even if you want it to. Pick up your three piece set in Black (featured), Dark Green, Gray, Navy Blue, Orange, and an assortment of other colorways, available while supplies last at Walmart. Spring break can be expensive, but these suitcases aren’t. Save your money for more drinks on the beach, and get this luggage set today at Walmart.
