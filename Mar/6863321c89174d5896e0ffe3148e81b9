Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker tried to calm tech investors and entrepreneurs who he conceded are “starting to panic,” as they fear a potential run on the bank, On The Money has learned. The boss of the 40-year-old financial firm — which saw its stock plummet 60% in afternoon trading on Thursday — gathered key venture capitalists and founders on a Thursday Zoom call to promise the bank is in a strong position with lots of liquidity. “My ask is to stay calm because that’s what is important,” Becker told listeners on the call. “We have been long-term supporters of you — the last thing we need you to do is panic.” On Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank said it would raise $2.25 billion following a $1.8 billion after-tax loss in various bets on securities. “We knew that would create a lot of noise which it has,” Becker conceded. “But what we wanted to do was reposition.. a low yield asset to a high yield asset.” Becker chose not to take questions on the call, noting that SVB is in the middle of a capital raise and thus in a quiet period. “I know this is a strange call,” Becker conceded. “But everyone talks… that creates an issue so I wanted to make sure we got in front of you.” Still tech founders, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Post, they are actively pulling their money out of SVB. The firm, which works with about half of venture-backed companies and advertises itself as the “venture capital industry’s leading bank,” is an institution in Silicon Valley. “Almost every Silicon Valley firm keeps their money at this bank,” one insider told The Post. But that doesn’t mean VCs or founders necessarily have a sense of loyalty, the source added. A spokesperson for SVB did not immediately respond to request for comment.
