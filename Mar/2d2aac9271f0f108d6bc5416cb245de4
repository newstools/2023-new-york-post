That’s just the way the thin mint crumbles. Girl Scout cookie enthusiasts may have to wait for their orders thanks to production issues at a Kentucky manufacturing facility, the organization announced Thursday. “We share the frustration that some Girl Scout troops feel this cookie season,” Little Brownie Bakers, the producers of the iconic cookies, said in a Facebook post. “Global supply chain issues, local labor shortages, and even unforeseen severe weather have all impacted the selling season.” LBB said its bakers are “working overtime” to fill the backlog of orders. Clients are not letting the company off the hook quite so easily, however. “This only hurts the girls. The girls are feeling let down, why try if they can’t even get the product to their customers,” one troop leader said on Facebook. “Then when LBB doesn’t change their rewards deadlines, again, why try?!?” “Strange you didn’t actually accept any blame. You pushed it to other groups,” one Facebook user wrote. “You screwed up, and your fake apology doesn’t put money into the accounts of the troops that need this money to function.” The production delays have been an issue for the company since the kick-off of the cookie-selling season in January, sources told CNBC. In an email obtained by the outlet, Girl Scout executives ensured local troop leaders that they expected LBB to be “more ahead of demand” than they had been proving to be. The stalled production only worsened last weekend after severe weather knocked out the power at LBB’s Louisville factory, forcing the company to halt production for an entire weekend. Delays have contributed to skyrocketing cookie prices, especially for the Girl Scout’s newest cookie “Raspberry Rally,” which is being auctioned off online for $100 or more.
