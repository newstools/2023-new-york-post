It appears that Green Bay is prepared to move on from Aaron Rodgers if the right scenario emerges. During an interview on the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association girl’s state basketball tournament broadcast, Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy was asked about a scenario where Rodgers would still be the quarterback for the Packers next season. “Yeah, I mean, unless, if things don’t work out the way that we would want them,” Murphy said, according to WBAY-TV. “Yeah, he is obviously a great player.” Nick Tabbert, the sports director at WQOW who conducted the interview, tweeted a photo from the Resch Center — where the Wisconsin-Green Bay basketball team plays its games — and thanked Murphy for appearing on the broadcast to answer Packers questions. Murphy said that he’d prefer for the situation to be resolved by the start of free agency March 15, with their goal to “find a resolution that works for Aaron and works for us.” He also confirmed the Packers granted the Jets permission to speak with the 39-year-old quarterback and would grant a trade request. “It’s about finding what he wants and what we want,” Murphy said, according to the local ABC news station. “And hopefully, it can be a win-win.” the tenor of those comments, it’d appear the Packers would be prepared to move forward with Jordan Love as their quarterback.
