For years, Gonzaga has made its name feasting on lowly WCC competition en route to an eventual top seed in the NCAA Tournament. That simply isn’t the case this year, and the Bulldogs should be on high alert for their conference tourney debut on Monday. These Zags have continued to dominate on the offensive end: they rank first in adjusted offensive efficiency for the fourth time in five years behind star scorer Drew Timme (21.1 ppg), who has shot 50 percent or better from the floor in each of his last nine starts. Defensively? It’s been a different story. (11:30 p.m. ET., ESPN2) Entering Sunday, Gonzaga ranked 88th in adjusted defensive efficiency — its first season outside the top 50 since 2010 — and it sits near the bottom of the country in opponent 3-point percentage (35.1 percent) and 3-point rate (39.1 percent). That’s a key reason why Mark Few’s group hasn’t pulled away from the competition this year: just seven of Gonzaga’s 14 conference wins came by double digits, and that doesn’t include two straight-up losses and a pair of wins by one possession. One of those came against San Francisco, which shot 10-for-23 from deep (43.5 percent) in a 2-point loss in early January. The Dons own one of the most aggressive 3-point offenses in the country and have made at least 13 triples in three of their last four games (3-1 SU). That likely won’t be the outcome on Monday, but don’t be surprised if San Francisco gives Gonzaga all it can handle. San Francisco, +11.5 (BetMGM)
