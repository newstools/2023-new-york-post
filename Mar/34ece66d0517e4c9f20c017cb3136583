The father of the young woman killed by Alex Murdaugh’s son’s drunken boating crash reportedly snubbed the once-powerful South Carolina legal family in court Friday before declaring “justice has been served.” Phillip Beach — whose daughter, Mallory, was killed when Murdaugh’s son, Paul, crashed the boat he was driving in 2019 — watched from the back of the courtroom Friday as Murdaugh was handed down two life sentences. When Murdaugh’s brother, John Marvin, approached him to shake his hand after the hearing, he refused — replying  “I have nothing to say to you,” according to the Daily Mail. Asked by reporters outside court how he felt about Murdaugh’s life sentence verdict, Beach replied, “I’m grateful” “Justice has been served,” he said in footage captured by wgem.com. Beach declined to comment on whether he believed Murdaugh should have received the death sentence. On the night of Feb. 23, 2019, Paul was “highly intoxicated,” and “belligerent” when he crashed a boat carrying 20-year-old Mallory and five other young folks near Parris Island, according to law enforcement. All six youths were thrown from the boat — but only Mallory didn’t make it to shore. Her body was found a week later. Alex Murdaugh was given two life terms for the murders of his wife and son. Beach’s snub came as photos of Murdaugh dressed in a confederate military uniform at the University of South Carolina emerged Friday. The images show the convicted killer at the “Old South” ball he attended with Kappa Alpha pals in 1989, grinning and wearing Civil War fatigues, according to the Daily Mail. Murdaugh was found guilty Thursday of killing his wife, Maggie, 52, and son, Paul, 22 in a bloody 2021 slaying which the prosecution says was motivated by his greed stemming from a drug addiction and his desperation to delay getting caught for a string of financial misdeeds tied to his legal practice.
