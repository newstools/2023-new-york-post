Cat got his tongue? The Red Sox-Marlins spring training matchup on Tuesday was interrupted in the seventh inning when a cat made raced across the field. The intrepid feline made its way toward the Red Sox dugout at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla., where it beelined for veteran NESN reporter Tom Caron, diving toward his head. The incident caused a bevy of laughter on the broadcast as the cat escaped into the stands and play resumed. “I’m reporting from the scene of the action here,” Caron told his fellow broadcasters. “We’ve got a cat that almost found its way into my hair, which would’ve been bad. “It seems to have found its way back to the concourse I think it went to get a beer before they close off for last call.” NESN analyst and former Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis was not going to let Caron off the hook so easily. “TC’s acting like that was a lion coming at him,” he said.” It was a house cat, TC. A house cat! No word on if the cat is indeed a southpaw and potentially of help to Boston’s suspect pitching for the 2023 season. The Red Sox did win the game over the Marlins 7-2 to move to a perfect 3-0 this spring. Caron did see the humor in the incident, taking to Twitter to poke fun and referring to the furry invader as a “ferocious beast” and telling one fan he’s “100% a dog guy.” “LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING,” he wrote over video of the cat running amok. This was not the first cat to interrupt an MLB game, and it likely won’t be the last. In 2021, a cat caused a game between Rockies and Dodgers to, ahem, paws, while fans chanted “MVP!” at one that delayed a Yankees-Orioles matchup.
