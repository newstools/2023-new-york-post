More than three years after the death of oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, his 65,000-acre Texas Ranch has sold at a colossal discount, The Post can confirm. Initially listing in 2017 for $250 million, the Mesa Vista Ranch, located 85 miles northeast of Amarillo, dropped its price by $80 million to $170 million in February 2022. While The Post cannot confirm the final price it sold for, sources revealed that the ranch “did sell within 10% of the $170 million listing price.” This means the ranch sold for a figure between $153 million and $187 million. Bill Kent, CEO of Kent Companies, headed a group of buyers who bought 36,000 acres of the western side of the ranch in December, which includes the 25,000-square-foot lodge, according to MRT. “He created an incredible property,” Kent told the Reporter-Telegram in a telephone interview. “It’s so gorgeous, all kinds of water. He created a paradise.” “My vision is for it to be not so much a personal property but something like a membership resort,” Kent added. “Something that revolves around hunting and the amenities there.” “I want to honor the property, be good stewards of the land and do what is in its DNA.” Several months prior, in September, cattle rancher Travis Chester bought the 27,700-acre eastern section of the ranch. Pickens, who earned his billionaire title through oil and natural gas, initially purchased the first 2,900 acres of Mesa Vista in 1971, building first a small corrugated metal livestock feed house. “In the last 25 years before his death, Pickens transformed the ranch into a “model of conservation and habitat management,” the previous listing says. Mesa Vista compound features a five-bedroom family house, an 11,500-square-foot lake house with three bedrooms and a 2,300-square-foot gate house with three bedrooms. There’s also a private airport with a two-bedroom apartment for pilots, a chapel, a pub, a golf course, a tennis court, a 400-square-foot gun room and — yes — that 25,000-square-foot lodge and conference center. It also features an 11,000 square-feet dog kennel that comes with a veterinary lab. Pickens also rebuilt his childhood home in Oklahoma on the grounds. Sam Middleton with Chas S. Middleton and Son and Hall and Hall held the listing. Pickens passed away at the age of 90 on Sept. 11, 2019. He was married five different times and left behind five children.
