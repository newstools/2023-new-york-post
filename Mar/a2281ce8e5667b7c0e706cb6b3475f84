When it comes to loving Rihanna, the “Last of Us” star is just like the rest of us. Pedro Pascal is going viral after telling a reporter at the 2023 Oscars that he’d literally push her aside to meet the “Pon De Replay” singer. The 47-year-old Chilean American actor had been chatting backstage to red-carpet correspondent Amelia Dimoldenberg during the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night following the 95th Academy Awards when he made the comment, Vanity Fair reported. Things were going swimmingly until Pascal seemed to get distracted by the sight of the Grammy winner, who had performed her Oscar-nominated song “Lift Me Up” earlier in the night. Dimoldenberg had asked “The Mandalorian” actor how he was doing, whereupon the star-struck Pascal asked, “Is that Rihanna?” while gazing wistfully off into the crowd. Alas, it wasn’t the R&B icon, which was perhaps lucky for Dimoldenberg, given the lengths Pascal jokingly said he would go to see the “We Found Love” singer. “I will literally shove you out of the way,” the thespian promised the interviewer, who appeared to understand where he was coming from. “Obviously, like, push me out of the way and go see Rihanna, that’s what I would do,” Dimoldenberg said. “No offense.” “If you didn’t do I wouldn’t understand,” replied Pascal. The dramatist wasn’t up for any awards himself but was rather playing “best-supporting brother” to his sister Javiera Balmaceda. She was in attendance for her contribution to “Argentina, 1985,” one of the nominees for Best International Film. Pascal also presented the awards for Best Animated Short and Best Documentary Short with Elizabeth Olsen. Coincidentally, the Oscars occurred on the same night that “The Last Of Us” season finale aired on HBO.
