Derek Carr’s biggest supporter “hearts” the quarterback’s new team. On Monday, the same day the 31-year-old Carr confirmed he’s signing with the Saints in NFL free agency, Heather Carr took to her Instagram Stories to react to the news. Heather posted two heart emojis, one in yellow and another in black, alongside a congratulatory message from Camilla Renfrow, the wife of Raiders wide receiver Hunter Renfrow, who wished the Carrs well on their move to New Orleans. “Could not be happier for our people,” Camilla captioned the post. Refrow, 27, and Carr had been Raiders teammates for four seasons, beginning in 2019, when the wideout was drafted in the fifth round out of Clemson. Carr was released by the Raiders in February after nine seasons. In the wake of his release, Carr had been linked to a bevy of quarterback-needy teams, including the Saints, Jets and Panthers. The Saints have been “ready” to sign Carr, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler said last week on “The Official Jets Podcast,” noting the organization was eager “to get something done” with the Pro Bowl quarterback. Saints coach Dennis Allen praised Carr’s skillset when speaking to reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis last week. “I think he’s highly competitive, he’s highly intelligent, he’s got a great work ethic, he’s an outstanding leader,” Allen said. “Those are all the qualities that I like about him, and those are qualities that we like in the quarterback position. We’ll certainly let that process take place, but we like the player.” Carr, who has been married to wife Heather since 2012, appears ready for a fresh start in New Orleans. The father of four posted a Saints-centric video Monday on Instagram that he captioned, “Who Dat.” With Carr being the first quarterback domino to fall in NFL free agency, it remains to be seen if Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers — who has been heavily linked to the Jets as part of offseason trade rumors — will be next.
