PORT ST. LUCIE — After a fairly healthy first few weeks of camp, the Mets have found their first injury obstacle. Imaging revealed Jose Quintana has suffered a small stress fracture on his fifth rib on his left side, the Mets announced Monday. The lefty will travel to New York for further tests. There is no timetable yet for his return. Quintana pitched a scoreless inning Sunday against the Cardinals and left with what the Mets called left side tightness. He had been set to join Team Colombia this week for the World Baseball Classic and was forced to pull out of the competition. “Now all I need is to get completely recovered and try to be ready for the beginning of the 2023 MLB season,” Quintana wrote in Spanish on Instagram on Sunday. If the 34-year-old, who signed a two-year, $26 million contract this offseason, has to miss prolonged time, either David Peterson or Tylor Megill could slot into the rotation.
