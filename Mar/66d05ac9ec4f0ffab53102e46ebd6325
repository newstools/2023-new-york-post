Gametime: 12 p.m. ET TV: ESPN2 Live Stream: ESPN+, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Yale (-3) over Princeton: The winner of the past two Ivy League Tournaments shall prevail again. The Bulldogs, who beat Cornell by 20 in the semifinals, have lost one game in the past two months, with its league-best defense most recently preventing the Ivy’s best offense from topping 60 points for the second time in as many weeks. The Tigers have Jadwin Gymnasium on their side, but Yale — which topped Princeton in last year’s title game and won by 22 in New Haven this season — has little trouble winning at Princeton, winning the past four meetings in New Jersey
