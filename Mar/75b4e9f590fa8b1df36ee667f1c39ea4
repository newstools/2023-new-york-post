Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ “I told you so” about Amazon did not go over well. The Democratic socialist was mocked when she bragged on Twitter about killing an Amazon headquarters in Queens, after news broke that the corporate giant was pausing construction on a similar project in Virginia. “When I opposed this Amazon project coming to New York bc it was a scam of public funds, the whole power establishment came after us … In the end, we were right,” AOC, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, tweeted Friday. “I know I’ll never get an apology for that time, but it was worth it.,” she continued. AOC was right — about not getting apologies. “You opposed it to get headlines and cost your district countless jobs. You should resign in disgrace,” tweeted Jacob Airey. Journalist Tom Elliott wrote, “Virginians have thousands of Amazon jobs that NYers don’t thank to you.” Another man tweeted, “that was 3 years ago, Tootsie, and it wasn’t a 2nd Headquarters. You are verified job killer!” “Right about what? Those jobs went somewhere else,” another Twitter user chimed in. Amazon said it was delaying the second phase of its Virginia project, which followed the biggest round of layoffs in its history. Amazon said the company still planned to welcome 8,000 employees to the first phase of the development when it opens this June. The construction setback comes four years after the company wanted to construct its second headquarters in Long Island City, a move that was supposed to bring some 25,000 jobs to the region. Amazon would have received $3 billion in state and local tax breaks, which some lawmakers thought was too generous.
