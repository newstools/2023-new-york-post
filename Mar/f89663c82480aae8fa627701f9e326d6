A passenger onboard a private plane was killed Friday when the aircraft hit severe turbulence. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the incident, which forced the Bombardier Challenger 300 business jet to divert to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The plane was carrying five people who were flying from Keene, New Hampshire, to Leesburg, Virginia, according to the NTSB. The safety board said it was interviewing the two crew members and two surviving passengers and that it had removed the jetâ€™s cockpit voice and data recorders. The agency said a preliminary report would be available in two to three weeks. A Federal Aviation Administration database showed the jet belonged to Conexon, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., and brings fiber internet to rural areas. The company declined to comment Saturday.
