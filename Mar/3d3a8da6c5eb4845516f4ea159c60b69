It’d be a shock if either of these teams took the Big East title, but someone has to move onto Round 2. Look for St. John’s use a virtual home court to their advantage during this one. Gametime: 3 p.m. ET TV: FS1 Live Stream: Fox Sports+, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Madison Square Garden will help. A matchup with the Big East’s worst offense matters more for a Red Storm defense which forced the Bulldogs into 22 turnovers in a 16-point win in Queens. Disaster looms in Round 2 for a St. John’s squad which has gone 2-13 in Quad 1 and 2 games this season, but Mike Anderson’s latest underwhelming season should add one more soft win, having gone 15-1 in Quad 3 and 4 games.
