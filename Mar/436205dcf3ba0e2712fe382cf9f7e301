Denise Russo, a reality TV star best known for starring in VH1’s  “The X-Life,” has passed away at 44 from undisclosed causes. The actress was reportedly discovered unresponsive Sunday on the floor of her friend’s apartment in San Diego, law enforcement officers told TMZ. First responders attempted to revive Russo but to no avail as she was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. While her cause of death remains unclear, authorities reportedly found drug paraphernalia at the scene. Meanwhile, Russo’s pal and former “X-Life” castmate Susie Stenberg told the outlet that Russo was living in her car at the time of her death and had contacted Stenberg the night before to tell her she loved her. Stenberg described Denise as the most “the most loving and loyal person.” An investigation into Russo’s death is currently underway, according to the San Diego PD. Not much is known about the star, except that she was one of the three couples on VH1’s reality show, “The X-Life,” which aired in 2011 and chronicled the lives of extreme sports competitors and their partners. At the time of the show’s broadcast, Russo was dating professional skateboarder Pierre-Luc Gagnon, with whom she had a son, although the two had reportedly split before her death. Russo regularly uploaded glamour shots of herself on Instagram with her last post coming just days before her death. Friends and fans were devastated over her loss. “My angel. I’m sorry for all your pain, be at peace now,” wrote one mourner. “I don’t understand. So beautiful. But battling all those demons,” mourned another. “Had to be awful. No more living in your car. No more using.”
