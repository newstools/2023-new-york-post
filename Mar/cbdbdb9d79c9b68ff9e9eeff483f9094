Pedro Pascal’s delightful encounter with a fan has gone viral on TikTok, but not just because he’s being an absolute sweetheart. In the clip, the US-Chilean actor, 47, can be seen happily chatting with a fan on the street, before signing an autograph on an action figure from his hit Disney+ series, The Mandalorian. But a closer look at the wholesome exchange reveals a ghastly detail about The Last Of Us star. That is, his Starbucks coffee order. Look, we all have our own tastes when it comes to coffee. An extra shot, oat milk, half a Stevia. But Pascal’s choice of brew is … Rare. Zooming into the video, it becomes evident Pascal opts for six shots in his Venti-sized cup. According to heathline.com, one shot of espresso is typically around 30–50ml, and contains roughly 63 mg of caffeine. Now, healthdirect.gov.au states it’s generally safe for adults to consume around 400mg a day, so Pascal is not veering into dangerous territory with his morning beverage (although he’s close). Still, his decision to have six shots in a single cup has horrified the masses on social media, who took to the comments section of the video with concerns. “That is a violent amount of coffee,” wrote one user. “Dude must have an iron gut,” said another. “Daddy needs his coffee every morning to carry the entire world and a fandom on his shoulders,” said a third, referencing Pascal’s large fanbase. “OUR MAN IS CAFFEINATED,” another wrote. It’s understandable why Pascal would need to be caffeinated to such a degree at the moment. The Game of Thrones actor is everywhere on streaming right now, with season three of The Mandalorian dropping earlier this month. HBO’s video game adaptation The Last Of Us has proved a smash hit among fans, becoming one of the only shows to become a roaring success off the back of a popular video game. Pascal plays the titular character Joel Miller, with fellow GoT alum Bella Ramsey co-starring as Ellie.
