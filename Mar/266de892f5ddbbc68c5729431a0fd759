Three brazen thieves stole a single handbag — worth a whopping $10,200 — from a Manhattan Louis Vuitton shop during business hours Wednesday, cops said. Two men and one woman plucked the designer bag from the open pop-up boutique on Gansevoort Street near Washington Street in the Meatpacking District just after 5 p.m. Wednesday, cops said. No one was hurt, according to authorities. The trio drove off in a U-Haul van with Arizona plates last seen heading toward the West Side Highway, cops said. The female suspect wore a white jacket and black jumpsuit, police said. One of her male accomplices wore all black, and the other wore a yellow, red and green jacket with black pants, cops said. At some point before the theft, one of the suspects went into the store and snapped a photo of either the bag or its price tag before all three returned to grab it, police said. No arrests had been made by Thursday morning, and the theft is not believed to be part of a pattern, cops said. The incident comes weeks after four brazen thieves bagged $52,000 in luxury merchandise — including handbags, shoes and clothing — from designer Givenchy’s Soho location, according to police. A Post analysis of police data earlier this month revealed that reported retail thefts in the Big Apple hit record levels for the second year in a row in 2022. The number of shoplifting complaints surged to more than 63,000 last year — a 45% jump over the roughly 45,000 reported in 2021 and a nearly 275% jump compared to the mid-2000s, the statistics show. Mayor Eric Adams emphasized his desire to crack down on unrepentant shoplifters during his testimony at an annual Albany budget hearing.
