It might be a Kelce family party at “Saturday Night Live” this weekend. Chiefs’ two-time Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce is set to host “SNLL and his brother — Eagles’ center Jason Kelce — was asked to make an appearance, according to TMZ. Not only will Jason likely get a cameo, but his mother Donna, Uncle Don, Aunt Joan, and father Ed will possibly be in attendance as well. Another with a similasr name — Kelsea Ballerini — is set as the musical guest for the night. It is still unclear if Jason will officially be making an appearance due to the fact that him and his wife are celebrating their newborn girl. As of now, the reality of seeing a Kelce brother reunion featured on the show is a “last-minute decision.” “SNL” released some promo clips for Travis and the show on Twitter Thursday afternoon. “Hi, I’m Travis Kelce and I will hosting ‘SNL’ this week with musical guest Kelce Ballerini,” Kelce said in the video. “Football isn’t that different from ‘SNL,’ we’re working under a lot of pressure. There’s a musical guest, we’re reading off Q cards … and it airs at 11:30 and I’m in a bunch of wigs.” Kelce, 33, is continuing his time in the spotlight following the Chiefs’ Super Bowl 2023 win over the Eagles 38-35. The tight end recorded six catches for a team-high 81 yards and a touchdown. It was Kelce and the Chiefs’ second Super Bowl title in four years. If the two brothers do take the stage together, expect the show to poke fun at Travis’ team defeating Jason’s in the Super Bowl as part of a skit. This will be the first time an NFL player has hosted the show since J.J. Watt in 2020. Kelce, 33, will be joining a long list of sports icons who have hosted in the show’s history such as John Madden, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan, George Foreman, Derek Jeter, Andy Roddick, and the Manning brothers.
