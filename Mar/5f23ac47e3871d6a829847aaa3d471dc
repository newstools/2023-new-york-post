She never skips shower day. One Equinox member in Texas took to TikTok to share her trick for getting free Kiehl’s products at the gym — and her strategy is more straightforward than you may think. Siena Atkins, who goes by the username @sisiatkins on the social media platform, shared the tip in a video that has already reached 3.4 million views. In the 7-second clip, she showed herself walking through the gym’s locker room and grabbing a small bottle of her own Kiehl’s moisturizer from her bag. She then entered the bathroom area, where she spied a full-size bottle of the same Kiehl’s moisturizer, which was provided by Equinox for gym-goers to use. Atkins pumped the product from the full-size bottle into her own smaller bottle and showed off its new contents. “Walking into the locker room to refill my Kiehl’s moisturizer because my $300 gym membership provides it for me so why go buy a new one I’m practically paying for this one already,” she wrote in white text over the video. The Post reached out to Atkins and Equinox for comment. In the caption of her video, Atkins wrote, “A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do🫡,” and used hashtags including “#equinox,” “#equinoxgym” and “#Kiehls.” Equinox and Kiehl’s first struck a deal in 2009 for the workout space to carry $10 million worth of products in their gyms. The body care company’s wares are also sold in Equinox’s retail boutiques, both in person and online. In the comments section of Atkins’ post, many users could relate and admitted that they do the same exact thing when they go there to work out. “I used to live with 3 girls and would supply all our towels and scrunchies from Equinox,” one user spilled. “I used to do that with the creme de corps on the showers. Product snatchers UNITEEEE!” one commenter wrote, while someone else confessed, “I used to take all the shampoo and conditioner and literally pump it out into my own bottle.” In Austin, Texas, where Atkins is located, the most basic tier to work out at their gym costs $215 per month, while a membership that allows you access to all Equinox spaces across the United States will run you $290 per month, according to Gym Price List. The top-tier membership costs $330 per month, according to the site. Others praised her for the hack, with some even joking that it was sustainable. “Hey you’re not buying a new package so it’s good for the environment!!” one person typed. A second wrote, “Never even considered this lmao but very smart also I agree, you guys pay such a steep monthly fee, you deserve it! ” Last year, the luxury health club announced that they would start accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in NYC.
