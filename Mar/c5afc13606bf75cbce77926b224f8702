A teen suspect targeted two youngsters in a pair of robberies days apart in Queens, authorities said. The crook — believed to be about 15 or 16 — first struck around 4 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, demanding that a 13-year-old boy hand over his sweatshirt and some cash at 146th Street and 101st Avenue in Jamaica, authorities said. The young suspect then simulated a gun inside his sweatshirt and threatened to shoot the younger boy, cops said. He made off with the victim’s shirt and $14, authorities said. The young teen was not hurt. Then on Feb. 17, cops believe the same suspect approached a 12-year-old boy around 7 a.m. at South Road and Sutphin Boulevard, also in Jamaica, and asked to use his phone, police said. The thief then flashed an unknown object that appeared to be a gun and demanded the phone, cops said. The victim complied, and the suspect ran off, heading north on Sutphin Boulevard. The pre-teen did not report any injuries. Cops released two surveillance images of the alleged robber Monday. The suspect wore black pants and a blue surgical mask in both cases. He is seen with a black winter jacket in the image from the first crime. In the second, he wore a light-colored hoodie.
