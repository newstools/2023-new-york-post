Longtime Giants radio broadcaster, Jon Miller, had some choice words for the Arizona Diamondbacks this weekend. Miller was frustrated with Arizona’s public relations team for not providing information to the broadcasters for Saturday’s exhibition game. “I have to guess the D-backs decided the heck with the big leagues, let’s just not be a big-league team for the split-squad (game).” Miller continued, “They have sent no public relations people over here, no information about who the manager is or anything at all about it. If they don’t want to be a big-league team, we’ll just treat them like a sandlot team,” Miller said, referencing the 1993 cult classic. “They gave us no information about anything. So, one of those guys in a red shirt is managing and one of their right-handers is on the mound.” Typically, public relations teams work with both home and away broadcasters to aid in giving information about the roster. Making the situation even more bizarre, the Diamondbacks are the only team in baseball who shares the same spring training location as their home ballpark. Salt River Fields is located in Scottsdale, Arizona, a short 20-minute drive from Chase Field, their home ballpark in Phoenix. Miller, 71, is a veteran broadcaster, having decades of experience, and received the Ford C. Frick award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame award in 2010. The Giants would go on to fall to the Diamondbacks 9-5 while former Met Michael Conforto hit his first home run with San Francisco.
