Prince Andrew is griping because he hasn’t received a penny of his mother’s massive fortune, according to reports. Queen Elizabeth was believed to have left an estate worth more than $782 million, all of it going to her son, King Charles, for tax reasons, The UK Sun reported. If the money is given “monarch to monarch,” Charles can avoid paying taxes on it, but the move also means his siblings — Prince Edward, 59, Andrew, 63; Princess Anne, 72, and  — haven’t gotten any of the cash. But unlike Princess Anne and Prince Edward, who are still working royals, the disgraced Andrew has no formal role in royal life and no income after the Queen stripped him of his military and royal titles in the wake of his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. “He’s in despair. He’s a member of the family, for God’s sake,” a friend told The Sun. “What’s he meant to do? Go cap in hand to his older brother to keep a roof over his head?” Word of Andrew’s “bewilderment” at being cut out of his mother’s money comes just a day after it emerged that Charles, 74, refused to sign off on Andrew’s $38,000 bill for a live-in Indian guru, The Sun reported. The guru reportedly treats Andrew with chants, massages and holistic therapy, according to the outlet.
