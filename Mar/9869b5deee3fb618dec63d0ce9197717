The new-look Nets continue to find their way in the weeks following the Kevin Durant trade, and their next test is a road game against the Houston Rockets. Brooklyn is listed as a seven-point favorite on bet365 Sportsbook, and I think that feels right with how the Nets have played recently. Brooklyn is starting to come together. The Nets have won two straight games and new forward Mikal Bridges is starting to take over as the leading scorer and dropped 30 or more points in each of his last two games. Itâ€™s not a one-man show, either. Brooklyn lacks star power with Durant and Kyrie Irving gone, but it makes up for it with a deep roster of solid, experienced players. Guys like Nic Claxton, Dorian Finney-Smith, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Cam Johnson (to name a few) are all reliable players who can play winning basketball. Houston is basically the exact opposite. The Rockets are the second-youngest team in the NBA and it has shown in their 15-49 record. Take the Nets to cover with bonus code NYP365 on bet365 Sportsbook.
