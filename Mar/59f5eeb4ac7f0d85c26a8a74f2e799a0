This end-of-inventory sale means you have to act fast if you want to get one in your size before it’s gone. Helios keeps you warm as you ski, hike, travel, work outdoors, or take trips to the grocery store. The coat turns on with a power bank (not included) that you can easily store in the inside zippered pocket with a built-in USB port. Power it on and select any combination of the four heating panels to start heating up. Choose between three temperature strength settings using the button on the inner pocket of the coat.
