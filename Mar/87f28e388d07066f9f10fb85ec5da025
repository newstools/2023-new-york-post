You never know what you’ll see at the World Baseball Classic — including a former Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player being struck out by an electrician. During a game between Japan and Czech Republic, Shohei Ohtani stepped to the plate while down 1-0 with a runner on second base, a prime spot for the 2021 American League MVP to potentially tie the game. Except, that’s not how this played out. Instead, Czech Republic pitcher Ondřej Satoria, who is 5-foot-9 and works as an electrician without playing professionally, per MLB.com, sat Ohtani back down on three pitches. Moreover, all three of Satoria’s pitches were south of 80 miles per hour. Unfortunately for Czech Republic, Japan managed to score three runs in the third inning and four runs in the fourth. Eventually, Japan won 10-2 and officially clinched a spot in the World Baseball Classic quarterfinals, and the team is now 3-0 in the tournament. Satoria will at least have a story to share for the rest of his life.
