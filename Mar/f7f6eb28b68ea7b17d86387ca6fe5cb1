Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Monday: Jose Trevino threw out Rays star Wander Franco trying to steal second base twice, one of them on a double steal. Last season — when the bases were still smaller — Trevino threw out 33 percent of attempted base stealers, which was tied for seventh-best among catchers with more than 25 attempts. Non-roster reliever Tyler Danish had a rough outing against the Rays, giving up six earned runs on four hits and two walks without recording an out. Another non-roster reliever, Nick Ramirez, struck out the side in the sixth inning on 12 pitches. Ramirez has thrown two scoreless innings with five strikeouts this spring. DJ LeMahieu, Giancarlo Stanton and Anthony Rizzo are all set to make their spring debuts as the Yankees host the Nationals at 1:05 p.m. at Steinbrenner Field.
