It’s all love between Oscar’s host Jimmy Kimmel and fertile father Nick Cannon. The 42-year-old “Masked Singer” host did not attend the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday night but gave TMZ his feedback on Kimmel’s opening monologue, which included a joke about him and his 12 offspring. “Disney spent $2 billion on this movie, and just to break even, all of Nick Cannon’s kids had to see ‘Avatar’ four times,” Kimmel, 55, joked about the Oscar-winning “Avatar: The Way of Water.” “It’s hilarious,” Cannon told the outlet while leaving the Avra Beverly Hills restaurant. “I created ‘Wild ‘n Out,'” he added about his longtime improv, comedy TV series. “I can hear jokes all day long.” Cannon, who added “Kimmel’s my man!” and model Alyssa Scott welcomed their daughter, Halo Marie Cannon, in December after the duo’s infant son, Zen, lost his battle with brain cancer the prior year. Halo was Scott’s third child and Cannon’s 12th. He welcomed son Legendary, daughter Onyx, and son Rise with Bre Tiesi, Lanisha Cole, and Brittany Bell, respectively. Cannon also shares son Golden and daughter Powerful with Bell, as well as two sets of twins — Monroe and Moroccan, 11, with Mariah Carey and Zion and Zillion, 1, with Abby De La Rosa. The former Nickelodeon star himself poked fun at his never-ending fatherhood last week by promoting a fake game show titled “Who’s Having My Baby?” to attract attention for the announcement of his and Kevin Hart’s newest project “Celebrity Prank Wars” premiering on E! on April 6. Last month, he told Entertainment Tonight last week that “God decides” when he stops having kids. “God decides when we’re done, but I believe I definitely got my hands full,” he admitted to the outlet. “And I’m so focused. I’m locked in. But when I’m 85, you never know. I might [have more].’
