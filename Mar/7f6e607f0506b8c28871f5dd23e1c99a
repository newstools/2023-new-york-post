Sir Michael Caine has one word to express how he feels about an anti-terror study determining his movie “Zulu” promotes white nationalism: “Bulls–t.” The 1964 film was included in a study by the British “Prevent Program,” claiming that it — along with works such as the “The Lord of the Rings” books, William Shakespeare’s writings and the “Great British Railway Journeys” docuseries — could lead viewers toward right-wing extremism. But 89-year-old Caine denounced that claim in an interview with The Spectator, saying, “That is the biggest load of bulls–t I have ever heard.” “Zulu” tells the story of the 1879 Battle of Rorke’s Drift amid the Anglo-Zulu war, including a scene in which 150 British soldiers fight off 4,000 Zulu warriors. But the Daily Mail reported that the film is facing criticism for its alleged “racist overtones” and “factual inaccuracies.” Caine, a two-time Oscar winner, was discovered by a “Zulu” producer while performing in a play at a theater in London’s West End. “An American director who was in the audience saw me and gave me a part in the film ‘Zulu’ as a posh officer. This made me a star and I never went back on the stage again,” he told The Spectator. He went on to star in films such as ” Sleuth,” “The Dark Knight Trilogy,” “The Prestige” and “Inception.” “There are no films I wish I hadn’t made,” Cain added elsewhere in the interview. “I got paid for all of them.”
