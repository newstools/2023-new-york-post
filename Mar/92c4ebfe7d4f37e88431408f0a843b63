Didn’t they know that’s ill-eagle? Two Honduran nationals believed to be illegal migrants were arrested in Nebraska on Tuesday after gunning down a North American bald eagle with the intention of cooking and eating it. The two men were identified as Ramio Hernandez-Tziquin and Domingo Zetino-Hernandez, both 20-year-old Honduran nationals living in Norfolk, the Stanton County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release. The duo indicated to authorities that they “planned on cooking and eating the bird,” according to the news release. Sources said the men had no identification on them. The pair are believed to be here illegally, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger told The Post Monday. “We do believe they’re here illegally after conferring with the United States Immigration,” he said. Police officers responded to a report around 4:00 p.m. of a suspicious vehicle near the main Wood Duck Recreation area, located about three miles southwest of Stanton. The car was found on a field in the 629-acre wetland and when officers stopped the men they determined they had a dead North American Bald Eagle in their possession. “Further investigation revealed that the two had shot and killed the protected national bird in that area and stated they planned on cooking and eating the bird,” the release stated. Unger said they also cut off the bird’s feet, intending to “make the talons into ornaments.” Nebraska Game and Parks was contacted and took custody of the eagle and the rifle used to kill the bird of prey. Both Hernandez-Tziquin and Zetino-Hernandez were cited for unlawful possession of the eagle. Hernandez-Tziquin was also cited for not having a driver’s license. Additional charges against the men are pending as officials continue to investigate the unlawful killing, according to the release.
