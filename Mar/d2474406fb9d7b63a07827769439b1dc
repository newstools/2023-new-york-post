Everything’s coming up roses for these seniors, who have newfound fans in Jay-Z and Rihanna. After a group of ladies at the Arcadia Senior Living facility in Kentucky went viral on TikTok for their recreation of Rihanna’s 2023 Super Bowl Halftime performance, Jay-Z rewarded them with a delivery of red roses, an insider confirmed to The Post. “We Love The Tik Tok Here At Roc Nation!” the artist’s card read, as shown in photos of the beautiful bouquet posted by the facility on its Facebook page last week. The “On to the Next One” singer’s music empire, Roc Nation, previously inked a partnership with the NFL in 2019. But Jay-Z wasn’t the only one who surprised them — Rihanna herself also sent a bouquet of white roses, which they revealed on their Facebook page as well. “We were excited to receive them,” Paige Oakes, director of community relations at Arcadia Senior Living Facility, told The Post over the phone on Monday afternoon. “The fact that we know Rihanna saw the video and enjoyed seeing them dancing to her music really just blew us away,” Oakes continued. The inscription on her card said their group dance was “amazing.” Oakes explained that they received them just when they thought the video was dying down, which made them all the more excited. The video has now reached over 30 million views on the social media app. The Post has reached out to representatives of Jay-Z and Rihanna for comment. The viral video, which was posted just days after Rihanna’s initial Super Bowl show, featured the limber ladies recreating the part of the segment where she performed the 2010 hit “Rude Boy.” The TikTok opened with a handful of the women dressed in all-white — a nod to the star’s backup dancers, who wore puffy white suits during the event. As all of the ladies dressed in white moved out of the way in a domino effect, the end of the 12-second clip revealed 87-year-old Dora Martin, dressed in red from head to toe, as was Rihanna herself during the performance. Martin lip-synched into a microphone while pretending to be the famous singer. The caption of their TikTok post jokingly read, “Our halftime show > Rihanna’s halftime show 🪩.” In a previous interview with The Post, some of the ladies revealed that they were “happily roped into” making the video by two young employees who worked at the facility. The video drew a lot of attention from TikTokers and fans alike, who left funny comments calling for the ladies to make more content on the platform. “Omg I love this and these ladies make more,” one fan wrote. It looks like they may be doing just that. Last week the living center posted a short clip of resident Martin and two others chuckling and fake preening to a snippet of Chris Brown’s “Look at Me Now.” Another added, “Love the ladies and the workers who help them stay so active and creative!.”
