A Tyvek suit-wearing gunman who killed a deli clerk on Manhattan’s Upper East Side during a string of robberies has been busted, police said Thursday. The suspect, whose identity wasn’t immediately released, was wearing white coveralls when he fatally shot a clerk at Daona Gourmet Deli at East 81st Street and Third Avenue on March 3, cops said. The NYPD’s Regional Task Force picked him up at Co-Op City in The Bronx — and he still had some of the purloined items on him, as well as the firearm, police sources said. The clerk’s identity hasn’t been officially released. Police believe the fatal shooting happened during a failed robbery attempt. The gunman took off from the store riding his scooter with only a rack of lighters, police have said. The suspect is wanted for three gunpoint robberies in the past 10 days as well — and in all of them, he wore the strange getup, cops said. Police found surveillance footage of the shooter on his scooter, heading into a Bronx public housing complex, Chief of Detectives James Essig said Wednesday. “He’s seen going in there — the rear of it — on his vehicle on that scooter,” Essig said. “And when we went near the back, we found that Tyvek suit. So that’s actively being processed by crime scene (investigators).” Cops found the white suit Tuesday night behind a building near East 158th Street and Park Avenue in the Bronx. It was unclear how they caught the suspect, but were attempting to get a facial recognition match off the video, Essig had said.
