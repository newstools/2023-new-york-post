Former Chiefs receiver Otis Taylor has died at 80-years-old, his family confirmed to the Associated Press. Taylor played in Super Bowl I and starred in Kansas City’s first title three years later. The former wideout spent his entire career with the Chiefs, which selected the Prairie Valley product in the fourth round of the 1965 AFL Draft. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and dementia in 1990, per NFL.com and the AP. “The Kansas City Chiefs organization is saddened by the passing of Otis Taylor,” Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said in a statement, according to Yahoo! Sports. “My family and I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to Otis’ wife Regina, his sister Odell and the entire Taylor family as we mourn his passing… He was one of the most dynamic receivers of his era, and he helped revolutionize the position. Off-the-field, he was kind and dedicated to his community. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. Otis’ legacy will live forever as a member of the Chiefs Hall of Fame.” The Associated Press reported that Taylor was “bedridden and largely unable to talk in recent years,” adding that his family filed a lawsuit — against the NFL — in 2012 that stated the league was “legally responsible for health issues” that dated back to his playing career. Taylor was a part of the Chiefs’ organization for 10 full seasons — plus an 11th year where he played in one game and didn’t record any stats. He totaled 7,306 receiving yards and 57 touchdown receptions across those years, and according to NFL.com, Len Dawson, his former quarterback, once said “Otis made my job easy.” Taylor also made the Pro Bowl in 1966, 1971 and 1972. When his career ended, he continued to work in the Chiefs organization as a scout for 11 years.
