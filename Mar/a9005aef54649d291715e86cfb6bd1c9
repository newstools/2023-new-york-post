Three police officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call in east Los Angeles Wednesday, police said. The cops had been responding to a report of a parolee at large in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood near the intersection of Mission Road and Broadway when the suspect opened fire at around 6:30 p.m. The LAPD said the officers were rushed to LAC+USC Medical Center where they are listed in stable condition. “Following closely tonight’s violent encounter resulting in 3 officers being shot,” LAPD Chief Michel Moore tweeted. “Reports from hospital have all three in stable condition.” One of the officers was shot in the stomach, while the other two suffered gunshot wounds to their extremities, CBS News Los Angeles reported. Cops first responded to the Lincoln Heights area around 4:30 p.m. to search for the parolee and encountered the suspect about two hours later when he barricaded himself in a building. They deployed tear gas to try to force him out — at which point he exited and opened fire at the officers, striking the three, according to the local outlet. The gunman, who was wanted for an unknown felony, was pronounced dead just before 9:30 p.m. following an hours-long standoff.
