At least three suspects targeted Uber and Lyft drivers in a robbery spree that netted them more than $30,000 over several months, cops said Thursday. The “group of unidentified individuals” ordered Ubers and Lyfts at least 24 times between July 4, 2022, and Jan. 7 of this year — in each case requesting that the driver change the destination before snatching their cellphone and running out of the car, police said. With the phones in their clutches, the crooks changed the information associated with the drivers’ pay accounts — and transferred “various amounts of money” to an unknown bank account, according to cops. Those fraudulent transactions totaled more than $30,000, police said. Cops on Wednesday night released video and photos of three suspects. It’s unclear whether any additional suspects were involved in the thefts, which spanned across the city. No arrests had been made by Thursday.
