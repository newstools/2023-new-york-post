The Knicks saw their biggest nightmare briefly flash in front of their eyes. Jalen Brunson fell awkwardly on his right ankle and immediately went to the locker room in the third quarter of Friday night’s 122-120 win over the Heat after contesting Jimmy Butler’s dunk attempt. He had 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting from the field and seven assists before the injury. He finished with 25 points and eight assists. Brunson returned to the bench near the end of the quarter in Miami, however, with his ankle taped. Just one minute into the fourth quarter, Brunson re-entered the game. Brunson was coming off one of his best performances of the year, recording 39 points, six assists and five rebounds on 15-of-18 shooting in the Knicks’ rout of the Nets on Wednesday. Although Brunson has landed on the injury report multiple times this season, he’s hardly missed any games due to injury. He was briefly sidelined with a hip injury earlier in the season.
