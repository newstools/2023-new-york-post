Dressers come in an astounding number of varieties. Want a wooden one? There are hundreds that fit the bill. How about sleek, modern and white? There’s a wealth of options, too. Much like outdoor patio furniture, a quality dresser can help spruce up your bedroom or foyer and, in our opinion, our quite underrated. Not only do they double as storage for your dress shirts and leggings but they can be styled in a number of ways (hint: go to Pinterest and our guide to the best home decor from Amazon and Target for some aesthetically pleasing inspiration). To help draw your shopping experience to a close (ha!), we rounded up the eight best places to order dressers online, from Target to Wayfair — and much, much more. With a solid area rug and bed frame, you’ll be glad that your home reno project is in full swing. One of America’s most sworn-in online retailers has an impressive amount of furniture in its wheelhouse (or, in its warehouse). A healthy amount boast rave reviews and are retailer best-sellers, so Amazon is at the top of our stamp-of-approval list. One of our favorites is the WLIVE 5-Drawer Dresser ($77) that’s backed by nearly 25,000 positive reviews and massive acclaim, so much so that we can’t believe it’s less than $100. Another luxe-looking option for less is the Nicehill 5-Drawer Dresser ($70) that has a sleek dark look with gold hardware. If you’re looking for a unique option with much storage space for the size, the LUMTOK 10-Drawer Dresser ($150) is one we’re fascinated by. Additionally, you can’t go wrong with the Storkcraft Brookside 6-Drawer Dresser Chest ($200) if you’re seeking an all-white option that’s perfect for a bedroom or nursery. As soon as our eyes reached the beauty that is Target’s dresser selection, we were colored impressed. From its sleek curvatures to its unique styling options, we wish we had ten bedrooms and empty rooms to decorate with one of these accentuated yet useful furniture pieces. The Saracina Home Jones Horizontal Modern 4-Drawer Dresser ($464) is one we keep glossing over, clad with a home decor magazine-worthy design. We’re also mesmerized by the farmhouse rustic charm characteristic of the Room Essentials Mixed Material 4-Drawer Dresser ($160), ideal for smaller spaces with its vertical design. Just as good is the Costway 4-Drawer Dresser Chest ($159) that’s a match-all option with incredible styling power. Likewise, the Prepac Mid-Century Modern 6-Drawer Dresser ($298) comes in an array of solid colors that will naturally suit your space — whatever it may look like. Sing it with us: Wayfair has just what I need. As the quintessential online retailer to order furniture from — especially considering most pieces are on constant sales — we couldn’t gatekeep one of our favorite destinations for dressers. The Winston Porter Jaxden 6-Drawer Dresser ($260) has a contemporary white look that’ll match nearly any bedroom for a crisp, clean look. What’s more, the Rebrilliant Bryken 10-Drawer Dresser ($98) is backed by hundreds of reviews and boasts more storage space compared to others on the market. You’ll also appreciate the modern design of the Sand & Stable Prudhoe 6-Drawer Dresser ($680) — a luxe-looking, quality option with a lovely two-tone design. Also great: the Everly Quinn Mattheau 6-Drawer Dresser ($204) that looks like it belongs in a Hamptons home or NYC waterfront apartment (for less!) We’re practically double-tapping and commenting heart-eyed emojis on all of the Anthropologie dresser options (no joke). If the beyond stunning Moroccan Inlay Six-Drawer Dresser ($2,298) or the Mark D. Sikes Six-Drawer Dresser ($2,598) aren’t enough to draw you in — pun intended — we don’t know what will. Additionally, we’re kind of obsessed with the Zagora Three-Drawer Dresser ($1,198) that we would love to showcase in a foyer or smaller-spaced bedroom with its gleaming brass hardware and neutral charm. Another dreamy option? The Ingram Four-Drawer Dresser ($898) that has a gorgeous navy color coupled with silver and brass hardware. It also comes in other hues, too. Have you ever been inside a West Elm store? Well, we have, and we want to come home with the entire showroom. Luckily, ordering online is simpler and still houses the brand’s classic catalog of well-made furniture. Its best-selling Mid-Century 6-Drawer Dresser ($1,399) is roomy, comes in a few neutrals and made from sustainably sourced wood. For a coastal-inspired design, add the Ida Woven 6-Drawer Dresser ($1,559) to your cart, clad with its relaxed, neutral-woven caning. For a simplistic take on your average dresser (but with gorgeous and sustainable wood), the Gemini 6-Drawer Dresser ($999) is one that you can just tell is of the finest quality. Similarly, the quality make of the Wood-Tiled 6-Drawer Dresser ($1,749) would pair exceptionally well with your tile or wood flooring. If you’ve ever forayed into in-person furniture shopping, you’ve likely stepped foot inside an Ashley Furniture. It’s where our personal dresser is from that we’ve had for nearly two years — the Willowton 6-Drawer Dresser ($460) — and are satisfied with its quality and look. Most dressers are online exclusives as well, like the handsome Naoki Modern 6-Drawer Dresser ($238). Fit for a bedroom to match your white furniture, the Anarasia 6-Drawer Dresser ($380) offers a crisp-white, cottage-like design. We also recommend the Neilsville 6-Drawer Dresser ($320) if you love all things rustic style. You know the drill: save money, live better. Luckily, Walmart has a great catalog of dressers to order online, most of which have high-end looks for budget-friendly prices. The Eumyviv 3-Drawer Dresser ($200) has a light and airy look with its farmhouse-inspired rattan detailing. The eclectic nature of the Catrimown Mid-Century 6-Drawer Dresser ($190) is the star of the show as well. For a unique-toned wood and classic-dresser look, aim for the Manor Park Sonoma 6-Drawer Chestnut Dresser ($328). We also adore the open-concept design characteristic of the Queer Eye Rayburn Weathered Oak Wide Dresser ($298), especially if you’d like to display towels or other knick-knacks. Urban Outfitters isn’t just for apparel (though we’re keen on it). Its dresser repertoire is unlike any other retailer we’ve seen. With classic styles and more intrinsic ones, too, we can’t stop looking at its online furniture shop. Two of our favorites include the Akina 6-Drawer Dresser ($1,099) and the Ruby 4-Drawer Dresser ($1,299). The former has an elegant wooden look that pairs well with any faux plant decor, while the latter has an exaggerated-curve look and wistful charm. More, the Mabelle Tall 5-Drawer Dresser ($1,199) is a wise play on the neutrals, offering much space for your buck.
