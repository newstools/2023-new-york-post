A massive whale that was once thought to be in distress was soon discovered to be suffering from a deformation of the spine. The 40-ton fin whale was spotted near Cullera beach last Saturday in Valencia, Spain, located about 200 miles southwest of Barcelona. Rescuers received a call from the skipper of a passing boat who thought the whale swimming close to the lighthouse area looked entangled. Biologists and veterinarians of the Oceanographic Foundation verified that the animal was not entangled in any driftnet, but suffered from a serious deviation in its spine; a scoliosis of unknown origin that completely altered his anatomy. Whales are sea mammals that are not known to develop scoliosis spontaneously, according to a 2021 study published in Nature. Several reports on cetaceans with scoliosis exist, however, all cases have a clear cause which is mostly of traumatic origin, like following a ship collision. Due to the magnitude of the whale being in the open sea and its malformation, it was impossible for veterinarians to place a remote tracker to obtain more detailed data about its condition, biology, and trajectory. A few hours later, the nearly 56-foot whale headed out to sea and moved away from the coast. However, the wildlife officials warned that it is possible that it could appear in the next few days due to his general condition and difficulty swimming. The fin whale is the second-largest whale on the planet, behind the blue whale. During the summer, the whale can be seen in Spanish Mediterranean waters.
