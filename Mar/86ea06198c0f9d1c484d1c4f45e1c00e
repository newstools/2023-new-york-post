Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Saturday: Giancarlo Stanton clobbered a pair of pitches for hits, lining a 102.9 mph double down the third-base line in the first inning and then smoking a 116.1 mph bullet off the left-field wall in the third. That one was hit so hard he had to settle for a single. Clay Holmes hit a batter with the first pitch he threw in the fourth inning, a 94.5 mph sinker that ran in on Max McDowell’s shoulder. It was the second batter Holmes has hit in three innings this spring. Michael King continued to look sharp in his comeback from a broken elbow. He threw a scoreless sixth inning with one walk, showing off a quality changeup — a pitch he threw just 9.6 percent of the time last season — and getting two whiffs on it, including for a strikeout. King is expected to throw two innings in his next appearance. Yoendrys Gomez will get the start against the Red Sox in a 1:05 p.m. game in Fort Myers, Fla., with Anthony Rizzo, Anthony Volpe and Jasson Dominguez among those on the travel roster.
