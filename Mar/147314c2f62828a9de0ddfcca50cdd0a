Former Ranger Esa Tikkanen is reportedly facing tax fraud charges in his native country of Finland. The allegations against Tikkanen are said to have occurred from 2015 to 2019 and involve money made overseas, according to the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat. The 58-year-old, five-time Stanley Cup champion has denied the charges, Ilta-Sanomat reported. “I have not committed any offense, it is a matter of disagreement with the tax authorities,” Tikkanen said. Tikkanen recently had 168,000 euros of property seized by Finnish authorities, but that was overturned, per the report. Tikkanen played for seven teams during his 14-year NHL career. He won five Stanley Cups over that period, four with the Edmonton Oilers and one with the Rangers in 1994. Tikkanen has long been thought of as one of the best Finnish-born hockey players of all time.
