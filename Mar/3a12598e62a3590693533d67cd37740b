Do you hear that? Just past the sound of birds chirping, of daffodils and hyacinths stretching awake after a long winter, of baby deer taking their first steps, of dew bowing off of blades of grass, of hares flapping long feet and skittering from bush to bush, of the inexplicable stirring of the heart that comes with the ginger opening notes of Spring? It’s the sound of the projects that you left last fall, calling you to finish them. The birdhouse, the new cellar door, the half-finished rocking chair, left in limbo before the holidays, are waiting eagerly for you to pick them up again. This week, make sure you have the right tools to meet the budding season with this 20V Max Cordless Drill and Driver Kit from DeWalt, now under $100 on Amazon. DeWalt has long been the gold standard (or should we say the yellow and black standard) of power tools, both for home projects and worksites. Whatever project you’re working on, ensure you’re in the best hands possible by snapping up this deal on DeWalt’s powerful drill/driver kit, now over 40% off on Amazon. Handheld, lightweight, and cordless, this powerful drill/driver from DeWalt is easy to charge, easy to fit in tight spaces, and a breeze to operate. Choose from one of two operating speeds, and point your new drill in the direction of your project. In the blink of an eye, it’ll be done, and you’ll be on to the next. Like the opening weeks of spring, this deal is fleeting. Pick it up today on Amazon for just $99. For more content, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
