The Jets have one fewer option at quarterback. Derek Carr has joined the New Orleans Saints in NFL free agency, the team announced Monday afternoon. He’s getting a four-year, $150 million contract with $100 million guaranteed, according to NFL Network. “Who dat ,” Carr wrote on Twitter. The Jets met with Carr in New Jersey and again last week at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis as they are searching for a veteran quarterback after Zach Wilson’s struggles in 2022. With Carr off the board, the Jets’ next best option is seemingly Aaron Rodgers, who has not yet decided if he wants to keep playing — and if so, whether he wants to remain with the Packers. Jimmy Garoppolo could be another option for the Jets in NFL free agency with the 49ers moving on from the 31-year-old after six seasons. Carr, 31, was a four-time Pro Bowler over nine seasons with the Las Vegas Raiders, who drafted him No. 36 overall in the 2014 NFL Draft. His time with the Raiders came to an unceremonious end when head coach Josh McDaniels benched him for the final two games of the 2022 season in favor of Jarrett Stidham. “I once said that if I’m not a Raider I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way,” Carr wrote on Instagram in January when it was clear the two sides were headed for a split. “That fire burning inside of me to win a championship still rages. A fire no man can extinguish; only God. So I look forward to a new city and a new team who, no matter the circumstance, will get everything I have. Winning a championship is what I’ve always wanted and what I will continue to work towards.” Carr finished the year with 3,522 yards passing, 24 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, which matched his career-high from last season. For the Saints, they hope Carr will be the post-Drew Brees answer at quarterback that Jameis Winston and Andy Dalton weren’t.
