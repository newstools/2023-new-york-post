Lady Gaga will perform her Oscar-nominated song at the awards show after all. Just a few days after Oscars producer Glenn Weiss said that Gaga will not be performing at the ceremony, a source close to production confirmed to The Associated Press that she will actually be singing “Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick.” The addition of Gaga means all of this year’s nominees for Best Original Song will be performing at the Academy Awards. Other nominees who will perform this year include Rihanna (“Lift Me Up”), Sofia Carson and Diane Warren (“Applause”), Stephanie Hsu, David Byrne and Son Lux (“This Is a Life”) and Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava (“Naatu Naatu”). It was reported earlier that the “Poker Face” singer had to turn down the offer to perform due to scheduling conflicts, Weiss confirmed Wednesday during the Oscars Creative Team press conference. “We invited all five nominees. We have a great relationship with Lady Gaga and her camp. She is in the middle of shooting a movie right now. Here, we are honoring the movie industry and what it takes to make a movie after a bunch of back and forth … It didn’t feel like she can get a performance to the caliber that we’re used to with her and that she is used to,” Weiss said. “So she is not going to perform on the show, however, this is all, from our point of view, about someone making a movie and us completely understanding that that’s what is priority in this business, especially when we are honoring movies,” Weiss continued. Gaga is currently in the process of filming the upcoming “Joker” musical sequel “Joker: Folie à Deux” with Joaquin Phoenix, where she will play Harley Quinn. Gaga is the first artist to receive three nominations in the Best Original Song category with “Holy My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Til It Happens to You” from “The Hunting Ground” in 2016, and “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” in 2019.
