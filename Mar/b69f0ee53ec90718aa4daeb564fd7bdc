They got these Hermes bags for a steal. Thieves ransacked a Midtown auction house early Tuesday, swiping Hermes Birkin and Kelly bags — among the most coveted bags in the world and valued between $6,000 to $50,000, according to sources and authorities. The bags were among eight snatched by three men, who cops say made off with a haul totaling $242,000 in value. “It’s wild,” said a shocked neighbor. “It’s across the street from most of the investment banks and private equity firms.” Heritage Auctions declined to confirm the brands or models of the stolen wares. The company said the burglary took place between 3 and 4 a.m. when the thieves busted the storefront windows. A local auctioneer was similarly surprised by the big-ticket theft, saying it reminded him of COVID-era smash-and-grabs on Fifth and Madison Avenues. “When you look at the office location of Heritage, it’s a prime location, Park Avenue,” said Sergei Ilyashenko, co-owner of Helios Auctions on 2nd Avenue. “Who would ever dare?  It’s pretty bold.” The theft comes weeks after a trio of men brazenly yanked a handbag worth a whopping $10,200 from a Louis Vuitton pop-up shop in the Meatpacking District during business hours. In mid-February, crooks pilfered $52,000-worth of shoes, clothing and handbags from the chic Soho Givenchy location. Grand larceny for the Midtown North precinct, which includes Heritage Auctions, is up 14% year to date, compared to the same period in 2022, according to NYPD data.
