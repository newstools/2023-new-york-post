PROVIDENCE, R.I. — No. 20 Providence is searching for answers going into the Big East Tournament. The Friars flopped in their regular-season finale on Saturday, losing 82-58 to Dre Davis and Seton Hall. The 24-point margin marked the biggest home loss in Ed Cooley’s 12-year run as Providence’s coach. Devin Carter scored 14 points for Providence, which shot 40% from the field and 4 for 23 from 3-point range. The Friars (21-10, 13-7) lost for the third time in four games — with the lone victory in that span coming against last-place Georgetown. “I did not expect a team to play like that, one that had so much to play for. You’ve got to show up,” Cooley said. “Am I playing the right guys? Am I playing guys who have a will, a want, and a passion? Hopefully we can reflect and bounce back. It is a new season, the Big East Tournament, but it’s a gut-check for our men. We’re not fighting like the team I know that we have.” Davis was 9 for 10 from the field. Femi Odukale had 19 points while KC Ndefo scored 15 for the Pirates (17-14, 10-10 Big East), who had dropped three in a row. Al-Amir Dawes finished with 11 points. Seton Hall shot a season-high 63% from the field. The Pirates made 10 3-pointers and led by as many as 32 points. “Our offense was generated off our defense. When our defense is playing at a high level like it was, it makes executing on offense that much easier,” Davis said. “I thought everyone was clicking on all cylinders. Everyone who touched the ball was involved.”
