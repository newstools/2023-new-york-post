It’s a steal! The posh New York City suburb of Darien, Connecticut has completed its due diligence and is shelling out a cool $85 million for a 60-acre island located right in the town itself. The sale is due to close in May, sources tell Gimme. Great Island, which has been owned by the same family for around 120 years — descendants of baking powder czar William Ziegler — first hit the market for $175 million in 2017. It was last asking $100 million. Dubbed the largest private island for sale on the East Coast, Great Island is accessible by land and by sea. Its striking features include a rocky bluff, sandy beaches on more than a mile of Long Island Sound shoreline and a deep-water dock that can accommodate a 100-foot yacht. The picturesque paradise features multiple structures, including a 10-bedroom, 13,000-square-foot main house built around 1905 — as well as a three-bedroom stone house, a 19th-century farmhouse, a bungalow and a beach cottage, according to the listing. There’s also a world-class equestrian facility, with 18 horse stalls and an indoor heated riding arena designed by architect Rafael Guastavino, used by five-time Olympic show jumper and gold medalist William Steinkraus. (The Steinkraus family are the island-owning descendants of Ziegler’s granddaughter, Helen.) Outside, there’s also an outdoor sand dressage ring and a half-size polo field, along with paddocks and riding trails. The Steinkraus family said in a statement: “Our family has cherished Great Island for over 120 years. It is a magical place and we are saddened to see it go, however, we are also excited to pass the torch to the town. We are confident they will be top-notch stewards of the land and preserve it for all to enjoy.” Jennifer Leahy, of Douglas Elliman, had the listing.
