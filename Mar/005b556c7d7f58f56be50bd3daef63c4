These are two of the worst teams in the NBA and it probably wonâ€™t be an exciting game to watch, but I think this game presents a solid betting opportunity. San Antonio is favored by 2.5 points over Houston tonight, and I think the Spurs are the play. Even though both teams are bad, San Antonio has been playing fairly well as of late and has home court advantage tonight. The Spurs have won their last two games and have some positive momentum after recently ending a 16-game losing skid. The players on the court are still competing and rookie Jeremy Sochan has already stepped up as a contributor. Meanwhile, the Rockets are mired in an 11-game losing streak. Houston does have some young talent in Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., and Alperen Sengun, but it just has not come together in the win/loss column. In a battle of bad teams, roll with the Spurs since they are playing better at the moment. If you agree, use bonus code NYP365 to back San Antonio on bet365 Sportsbook.
