Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Thursday: First-base prospect Andres Chaparro flashed his booming power when he drilled a grand slam in the top of the ninth. The Yankees carried a combined no-hitter into the ninth inning before non-roster reliever Matt Bowman gave up a pair of hits — including a home run, and two walks. Wandy Peralta looked like he was in midseason form, striking out the side on 14 pitches in the second inning. He also worked incredibly fast, using the pitch clock to his advantage as he wasted no time starting his delivery after getting the ball back from the catcher. “It’s right up his alley,” Aaron Boone said. “Just gives him something else to mess with.” Gerrit Cole is scheduled to make his first start in Grapefruit League play when the Yankees host the split-squad Tigers at 6:35 p.m. at Steinbrenner Field.
