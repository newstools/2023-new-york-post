US Sen. Rick Scott ripped Mayor Eric Adams as an “embarrassment” for floating a $1.2 million plan to send migrants to college on the taxpayers’ dime. “New Yorkers are fleeing due to the high crime, high taxes, and woke leadership,” the Florida Republican tweeted Friday. “Now @NYCMayor wants them to pay for illegal migrants to go to school?  Mayor Adams’ leadership is an embarrassment.” The centrist Democratic mayor and retired NYPD captain fired back by accusing Scott of purposely being deceitful. “This isn’t true and you know it,” Adams tweeted. “These aren’t ‘illegal migrants.’ They’re asylum seekers, here legally. This is part of the workforce training and relocation program that will actually save taxpayers money. “Stop misleading the public and do your job,” Adams fired back. This is not the first time Scott publicly attacked Adams. During a Fox Business Network appearance last April, the senator ripped Adams for trying to lure Floridians to the Big Apple with digital billboards opposing a new law there that bans the discussion of sexual orientation in grades 3 and below. “I don’t think anybody’s moving back. What he ought to be doing is running ads in his own city to try to get people to quit moving. So many people are moving out of the Northeast down to Florida because they don’t want high taxes,” Scott said during the interview, according to FloridaPolitics.com
