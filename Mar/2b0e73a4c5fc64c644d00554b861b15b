We are a day away from Selection Sunday, but before we get to the college basketball main course, there are a few conference tournaments to wrap up. The Atlantic 10 is unique because it takes Friday off before playing its semifinals on Saturday. One of the games features Saint Louis taking on top seed VCU. Those teams met twice in the regular season and VCU won both times. Saint Louis shot the lights out in its quarterfinal romp over George Mason. (1 p.m. ET) The Billikens were never challenged in the 82-54 win, shooting a blistering 56 percent from the field. Saint Louis will find things a bit tougher on Saturday when facing a VCU defense that ranks 18th in defensive efficiency on KenPom. I like VCU in this spot laying a short number. The Rams won by eight and 12 in the first two games and don’t buy into the “It’s hard to beat a team three times” narrative. It’s a fallacy in college basketball. I’ve been backing teams that swept regular season series all week long with favorable results. One thing to watch in this game is how the officials are calling fouls. VCU lives from the foul line, ranking ninth in free-throw attempts per game. Meanwhile, Saint Louis fouls its opponents at an above-average rate. That was evident in the first two meetings, in which the Rams shot 44 free throws, compared to just 22 for Saint Louis. VCU has been the class of the A-10 all season. Look for the Rams to cover and advance to the championship game on Sunday.
