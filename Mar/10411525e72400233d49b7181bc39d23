Tyreek Hill is living up to his nickname “Cheetah.” The Miami Dolphins wide receiver, who is arguably the fastest player in the NFL, won the 60-meter sprint on Saturday at the USA Track and Field Masters Indoor Championships, posting a 6.7-second time – just a few tenths of a second shy of the world record. Video from the event showed Hill, who rocked a speed suit from his alma mater Coffee High School (Georgia), blazing his opponents in the 25-29 age division. “Never racing again had me out there looking wild,” the All-Pro receiver tweeted afterward. The event was Hill’s first track event since 2014, when he was racing as a student at Oklahoma State, according to NFL.com. Hill was a track star in high school, where he won state titles in events such as the 100-meter and long jump. He was also an All-American at Oklahoma State in long jump. The 29-year-old’s running talents translated perfectly onto the football field, where he gained popularity for his quick speed. Hill rose to football superstardom with the Chiefs, notching a Pro Bowl appearance every year during his first six seasons in Kansas City and winning a Super Bowl with the team in 2019. The receiver was traded to the Dolphins before last season, where he finished his 2022 campaign with career highs in receiving yards (1,710) and receptions (119). Hill will look to replicate, or even increase, those numbers with a hopefully healthy Tua Tagovailoa next season.
