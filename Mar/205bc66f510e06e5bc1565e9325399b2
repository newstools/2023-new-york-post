Two men in black ski masks robbed a Manhattan straphanger at gunpoint — snatching Louis Vuitton sneakers worth more than $4,000 and other pricey duds, police said Monday. The 31-year-old victim was about to get off a northbound Q train as it neared the 34th Street-Herald Square station around 6 p.m. Sunday when the muggers approached him and one of them flashed a gun, cops said. The pair grabbed the man’s shopping bag holding the $4,400 high-fashion sneakers and items from multiple other designer brands, plus an iPhone, police said. He got off the train, but the crooks — who also wore black hoodies — stayed on board, according to cops. The total value of the stolen goods was $9,300, the victim told police. No injuries were reported. No arrests had been made as of Monday afternoon.
