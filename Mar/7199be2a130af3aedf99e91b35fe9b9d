Matthew Mayer was a little too wired The Illinois guard and forward told reporters he has been sick the past two days due to “caffeine poisoning” from the six Monster energy drinks he consumed while playing video games on Sunday after the Fighting Illini’s loss to No. 13 Ohio State 60-72. Wednesday marked his first day back to practice ahead of Thursday’s night game against Michigan at Illinois’ State Farm Center. “I had six Monsters the day of the game,” he said. “I only had one before but I had five after because I like a caffeine induced euphoria to play video games. “I could barely get out of bed the next day. It was basically like a caffeine hangover. So, this is my first day of practicing since then.” Mayer’s over-caffeination likely won’t affect his playing time — good news for Illini, who sit at seventh in the Big Ten with a 19-10 overall record (.655). With one Monster in him against the Buckeyes, Mayer posted 11 points, shooting 4 of 11 from the field, along with three rebounds and one assist. Mayer made no mention of his current state and seemed ready and willing to get back out on the court in preparation for No. 4 Michigan and the regular season-ending matchup against No. 1 Purdue on Sunday. This season, the 6-foot-9 starter has averaged 12.6 points per game, with a field goal percentage of 42.4 and 36.0 from beyond the arc. Illinois is not expected to an NCAA Tournament team, but perhaps Mayer can share some of his excess energy with teammates ahead of the Big Ten tourney.
