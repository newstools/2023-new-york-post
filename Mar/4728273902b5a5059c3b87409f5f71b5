A writer put on the “Sh—ty Media Men” list settled his defamation suit with the catalogue’s creator Friday, new court papers show. New Orleans-based writer Stephen Elliot was listed on the crowdsourced spreadsheet of sexual misconduct allegations against men working in the media. Elliot sued list creator Moira Donegan for $1.5 million in Brooklyn federal court in 2019, accusing her of defaming him and seeking the names of other women who contributed to the list. Elliot and Donegan settled the suit but terms were not released, according to a filing in the case. Earlier, a judge denied Elliot’s bid to have the identities revealed for the other 30 women who anonymously contributed to the repository. Before that, Elliot’s lawyers had failed to get the information from Google. The database briefly appeared online on Oct. 11, 2017 — but it went viral after Buzzfeed published an article about it. Critics of the list said it was made up of unproven allegations and was reckless but Donegan – a freelance journalist – defended herself, saying: “I only wanted to create a place for women to share their stories of harassment and assault without being needlessly discredited or judged.” Elliot’s lawyer declined to comment. Lawyers for Donegan didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Additional reporting by Joyce Cohen
