A pair of Alabama basketball fans were spotted wearing T-shirts that said “Killin’ our way through the SEC in ’23” during the SEC tournament semifinals on Saturday. Former Alabama player Darius Miles was indicted Friday on capital murder charges stemming from the Jan. 14 shooting death of Jamea Harris. Miles admitted to police that he provided the gun his friend Michael Lynn Davis allegedly used to shoot Harris after a brief verbal spat between Davis and Harris’ boyfriend, Cedric Johnson, outside a bar. Miles texted Alabama star and projected top NBA Draft pick Brandon Miller asking Miller to bring him his gun. Miller was picking Miles up, and Miller’s lawyer said Miller was unaware Miles’ gun was in the vehicle. Miller has continued to play since the shooting. Alabama earned the No. 1 overall seed in March Madness. The Crimson Tide defeated Texas A&M 82-63 in the SEC Championship game early Sunday. Fans were warned that they faced ejections if the shirts were worn on Sunday, according to the Washington Post. The Alabama basketball team seemed to poke fun at the incident with the now infamous pat-down incident before a game late last month, when Miller was frisked by a teammate. Recently, Alabama guard Jahvon Quinnerly — a native of New Jersey who transferred in from Villanova after the 2019-20 season — was asked by a reporter if he had a gun. Quinnerly replied with a simple “no.” On Thursday, the No. 1 Crimson Tide will play the winner of Tuesday’s First Four game between Texas A&M Corpus Christi and Southeast Missouri State as part of the NCAA Tournament’s first round. The game will be played at Legacy Arena in Birmingham, Alabama.
