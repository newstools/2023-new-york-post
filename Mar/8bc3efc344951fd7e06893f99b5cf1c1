The Tua Tagovailoa era will continue in Miami. The Dolphins are picking up Tagovailoa’s fifth-year option, NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported Friday. Tagovailoa will be guaranteed $23.2 million for the 2024 season, the report said. The move by the Dolphins signals the organization is comfortable moving forward with the former first-round pick, who suffered at least two concussions last season. Tagovailoa’s long-term future in the league had come into question this offseason amid concerns about his overall well-being. Leading up to Friday’s news, rumors started to circulate linking the Dolphins to a newly retired quarterback. In fact, NFL Network’s Rich Eisen floated the possibility of Tom Brady un-retiring and called out the Dolphins as a potential landing spot. “The one place that folks are saying to keep an eye out for is Miami,” Eisen said on his self-titled show earlier this week. “If the Dolphins, somehow or some way get a doctor’s report or piece of information from a medical evaluation of Tua [Tagovailoa] that he may not be ready to go, and suddenly there’s Tom Brady sitting in Florida, where his family is located and where he can easily locate himself.” Brady has since shut down those rumors, citing his new role as a cat caretaker to his 10-year-old daughter’s kittens. Tagovailoa, the fifth overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, took a step forward in 2022. The 25-year-old quarterback threw for a career-high of 3,548 yards in 13 games, along with 25 touchdowns and eight interceptions. In Mike McDaniel’s first season in Miami, the Dolphins finished the regular season with a record of 9-8 and advanced to the playoffs.
