The man accused of killing an Upper East Side deli worker while wearing a HAZMAT suit during a string of robberies was walked out of the 19th precinct on Thursday night hours after his arrest. Kimond L. Cyrus, 39, remained silent when reporters peppered him with questions as detectives escorted him into the back of a cop car with his hands and feet shackled. Cyrus is accused of gunning down a 67-year-old employee of Daona Gourmet Deli on E. 81st  Street and Third Avenue during a botched robbery last Friday night, police said. Police identified the employee on Thursday as Sueng Choi, of Queens. Cyrus allegedly pistol whipped Choi with a gun when it went off, killing him, according to police. He was charged Thursday with murder and criminal possession of a weapon. He was also wanted for three other armed robberies at city delis and bodegas over a 10-day period. He was finally busted after police received a tip on Sunday when a citizen called and claimed they saw him at a bodega in the Bronx near Crotona Park and said the person drove off on a scooter. Police had difficulty identifying the suspect as he wore a mask and a white, full-body Tyvek suit during the robberies. Cops got surveillance footage from the alleyway at 1700 Crotona Park East that captured a man on a scooter in a Tyvek suit leaving just over an hour before the March 3 murder in Manhattan. Video then shows the man returning without the hazmat gear around 20 minutes after a second robbery later that night in The Bronx, Chief of Detectives James Essig told reporters at a press conference Thursday morning. Police identified the suspect as Cyrus after reviewing the footage. Cyrus previously served a two-year sentence in state prison in June 2003 after he was convicted of second-degree assault in Manhattan, according to state records. He was paroled in July 2005 and released from supervised parole in March 2006.
