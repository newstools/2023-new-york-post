The new Daisy Jones & The Six series on Amazon Prime is reigniting everyone’s love for music. If you’re anything like die-hard music fans, you love to reminisce by collecting and playing vinyl records from your favorite artists. 43.5 million records were sold in 2022 but only 50% of vinyl buyers own a record player. The Mbeat Hi-Fi turntable brings quality to music lovers wanting to dive into their nostalgia at a fair price. This classic turntable with built-in bluetooth speakers is now just $249.99 (reg. $369.95). Vinyl collecting is a fun hobby, and you should be able to play your records without draining your hard-earned money or settling for a low-quality player. This turntable has excellent sound quality and several features to reduce noise while playing 33 and 45 RPM albums from your collection. Enjoy crystal-clear music without those unwanted vibrations that sometimes happen with vinyl records. Connect to the built-in bluetooth speakers to play digital playlists or even podcasts. You can also connect the turntable to a larger stereo setup or speakers with the RCA audio output. This means you can completely customize your listening experience and use equipment you already have. One unique feature of this turntable is the full-sized platter to spin your records smoothly and securely. Other turntables at similar price points suspend your record over the edges of the player and produce low sound quality and potential damage to your cherished albums. This turntable adds a vintage vibe to your space with the American walnut veneer-like finish and the sepia tone lid. It could be the life of the party at your next gathering or the perfect way to play some soft music in the background while you work. Travel back in time with the Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable with Bluetooth Speaker for only $249.99 (reg. $369.95). Prices subject to change.
