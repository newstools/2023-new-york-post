After interviewing celebrities, athletes, and politicians for the past two decades, there was one notable person Jimmy Kimmel hadn’t interviewed: himself. On the 20th anniversary of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the late-night host used advanced technology to have a conversation with his 2003 self. Kimmel, 55, asked for side-by-side photos of his present self and from his first episode as the younger Kimmel came to life greeting his future self. “Nice beard, Grandpa” the clean-shaven host began. “Why are you so skinny? Oh no, am I dying?” the younger Kimmel added. “No you’re not dying, this is what you look like in 20 years,” Present day Kimmel said. “Gross.” The duo later discussed how ridiculous it was for the show to remain on the air since its premiere on January 26, 2003. “Speaking of ridiculous,” the older Kimmel said, “take a guess on who was president up until a couple of years ago?” “Uhh, Flava Flav,” the younger Kimmel answered before guessing Michael Jackson and Matt Damon, a nod to the on-screen feud the host has with the actor. After talking about their longtime nemesis, the younger Jimmy asked how it was possible for the two of them to be talking to each other. “We have amazing technology now,” Kimmel said. “We’ve got 3-D printers, we got electric cars, we got electric cigarettes now. Marijuana’s legal.” “Get the f–k out of here! Are you high right now?” younger Kimmel said in disbelief. “I am baked out of my mind right now,” present-day Kimmel added. I’m so high right now, it feels like I’m talking to myself.” The rest of Thursday night’s show featured the same line-up of guests who graced Kimmel’s stage in his first show, including George Clooney, Snoop Dogg, and a performance from British rock band Coldplay.
