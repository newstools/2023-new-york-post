Three people were shot across the Big Apple late Tuesday — including one man who was killed in Brooklyn, authorities said. Philson Andrews, 36, was blasted multiple times in the torso and right arm at East 56th Street and Church Avenue in East Flatbush around 9:30 p.m. by a man who then fled, cops said. Andrews was rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. The motive for the shooting was unclear Wednesday morning. Cops described Andrews as “known to the department,” but he hasn’t been arrested in more than 15 years. A 31-year-old man was then struck in the head on Lexington Avenue near East 109th Street, on the grounds of the Governor DeWitt Clinton Houses in East Harlem around 10 p.m., cops said. At least five shots were fired, police sources said. The victim went by private means to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. The motive was not immediately known. The victim is also “known to the department,” cops said. About an hour earlier, a 28-year-old man was shot in the right leg at Beach 36th Street and Rockaway Freeway, cops said. He walked into St. John’s Episcopal Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The circumstances leading to that shooting are also unclear. No arrests have been made in any of the incidents.
