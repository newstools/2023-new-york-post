A prisoner made two grand escapes from incarceration and went on a two-month crime spree spanning three states — which only ended when he crashed a stolen Porsche during a high-speed police chase in Texas. The rampage started in November when Tyler Payne, 31, and Thomas Cofer, 41, escaped from the Choctaw County jail in Oklahoma through the roof, according to WBAP. The duo then made their way to Frisco, Texas. Two women who were out shopping had their purse stolen by the runaways on Nov. 14, police said. One 71-year-old had her bag strap around her neck and was dragged to the floor as the thief tried to take it from her — leaving her with cuts and bruises, Frisco police said. Payne and Cofer’s luck ran out in Mississippi and they were arrested after police say Payne car-jacked a grandparent who was dropping a child off at school, as reported by WAPT-TV. But it was a short incarnation for Payne, who was miraculously found to be missing during the prison headcount on Christmas Day, according to KLTV. He and another inmate, Treverro McElroy, 36, fled the Hinds County jail in Raymond. His original partner in crime, Cofer, was not part of the second jailbreak. The wanted men went to a nearby church where they stole a van and made a getaway. The vehicle was later recovered from “a body of water” in Texas, the Hinds County sheriff said. “A witness reported a [white male] pushing the van into the water,” the sheriff stated. On Jan. 10, Payne returned to Frisco where police say he stole a Cadillac SUV, then upgraded, stealing Porsche in Dallas the same day. As several police agencies tracked him, a police pursuit ensued down I-35 — ending when the sports car crashed on the highway. Now detained again, Payne is currently in the hospital in Texas facing multiple new charges, and law enforcement also plan to extradite him to Mississippi. McElroy, his crime spree partner in the second, escape remains on the run as of Friday.
