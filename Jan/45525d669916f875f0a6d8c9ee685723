“Pirates of the Caribbean” star Johnny Depp was reportedly by Jeff Beck’s bedside along with “some other rock stars” before his friend’s death Wednesday. A source told People that the star is “devastated” by the loss of Beck, with whom he recently toured with and collaborated on an album. “They had a really tight friendship, they were extremely close, and he got even closer over this past summer when they were touring together,” said the unnamed source. “The sickness came on really quickly and it all deteriorated rapidly in the last couple weeks.” The Post has reached out to Depp for comment. Depp, 59, and Beck released an album entitled “18” in July and later released a music video for one of the songs off the album. “Johnny is still processing this news. He’s devastated,” a source told The Post. “It’s an extraordinary honor to play and write music with Jeff, one of the true greats and someone I am now privileged enough to call my brother,” Depp said at the time of the music video’s release. Depp also allegedly used the album to slam his ex-wife Amber Heard. At the time, Beck had also released a statement at the time stating how privileged he was to work with the “Sweeney Todd” actor. “I haven’t had another creative partner like him for ages,” said Beck. “He was a major force on this record. I just hope people will take him seriously as a musician because it’s a hard thing for some people to accept that Johnny Depp can sing rock and roll.” The guitarist’s death was confirmed by family members on Twitter. “On behalf of his family, it is with deep and profound sadness that we share the news of Jeff Beck’s Passing,” read the statement. “After suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis, he peacefully passed away yesterday. His family asks for privacy while they process this tremendous loss.”
