Industry bigs who had foot cramps after the Real Estate Board of New York’s annual gala last year can relax: they’ll have a place to sit next time. A REBNY rep confirmed our tip that the event, which became a floor-roaming, walkaround affair in 2022, will be a seated dinner again, “although not a full return to banquets of yore.” An on-foot networking portion will follow the dinner. REBNY moved the stuffy, mid-winter bash at the Hilton ballroom to West Side event space Glasshouse last June. The cloutful likes of Douglas Durst, Scott Rechler, Mary Ann Tighe, Bruce Mosler, Woody Heller and Joanne Podell nibbled snacks supervised by Daniel Boulud. Not everyone loved the new format. One dealmaker told me, “There was no place to put dishes down except for some tiny table stands. For $1,400 a ticket I want a place to sit.” Our source said the tab would be $2,000 this year, which REBNY wouldn’t confirm. The retail malaise just claimed another legendary New York institution. Hammacher Schlemmer will close permanently at 147 E. 57th St. on Jan. 14 after 97 years there. The store famous for cutting-edge electronic and mechanical  gadgets — even once a miniature submarine — will continue to sell its products online.
