A 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in East Harlem on Sunday – the latest teen to succumb to gun violence in the city, cops say. Dominick Allen was blasted in the chest on East 105th Street near First Avenue around 5:15 p.m., authorities said. The motive for the killing is unclear. When cops responded to the scene for a “shots fired” call, Allen had already been taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. Police found “numerous” shell casings at the scene, police said. No arrests have been made. The shooting comes weeks after NYPD data reviewed by The Post revealed that a growing number of teens are getting shot in the Big Apple — and that other youngsters are the ones pulling the trigger in the majority of the cases. NYPD statistics show that youngsters pulled the trigger in 98 shootings in the five boroughs from Jan. 1 through Sept. 1 of last year, with 119 of their targets also under 18. “Unfortunately, we are seeing the highest levels of youths under the age of 18 involved in gun violence,” NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said on WABC-770 radio’s “Cats at Night Show” last month. The chief pointed to “the availability of guns” as a possible reason for the spike. “And in certain circumstances, there are no repercussions for when people get arrested for guns,” he told host John Catsimatidis. “They’re coming right out [of court.]”
