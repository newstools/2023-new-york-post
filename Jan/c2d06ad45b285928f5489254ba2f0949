First Marilyn, now Diana: Kim Kardashian continues to plunder cultural icons for clout. The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star reportedly bought Princess Diana’s iconic diamond necklace, known as the “Attalah Cross,” during an auction Wednesday at a Sotheby’s auction, according to TMZ. According to a rep for the company, the historical piece was sold for a whopping $197,453. The beautiful bauble was worn by the late Princess of Wales — it was loaned to her by Garrard & Co. jewelry — when she attended a 1987 London charity gala. The Post has reached out to Kardashian for comment. This apparently isn’t the first time the reality star has bought herself a piece of culture. The 42-year-old also has items that once belonged to Elizabeth Taylor and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, according to TMZ. Last year, Kardashian created a stir when she arrived at the Met Gala in the sheer gown that Marilyn Monroe wore when she sang “Happy Birthday” to John F. Kennedy. “I’m extremely respectful to the dress and what it means to American history,” Kardashian said to Vogue. “I would never want to sit in it or eat in it or have any risk of any damage to it and I won’t be wearing the kind of body makeup I usually do.” Allegations arose, however, that the dress — declared a “national treasure” — may have been damaged because of the night out. The bedazzled dress appeared to be “missing” crystals, according to the Marilyn Monroe Collection Instagram account, which claimed that others seemed to be “hanging by a thread.” A representative for Ripley’s previously told The Post that Kardashian showed “the utmost respect” for the garment, saying that “no damage” had occurred to the dress. “I tried it on and it didn’t fit me,” Kardashian had stated on the red carpet about her first fitting. “It was such a challenge. It was like a role — I was determined to fit in it.”
