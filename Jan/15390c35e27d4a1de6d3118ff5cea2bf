Bathing suits have become increasingly skimpier over the years — but one woman’s vintage piece has inspired followers to want the 1950s-style swimsuit to return. TikTok user Gabrielle “Gabi” Jones often posts videos of herself wearing vintage clothing, showing off her favorite looks and quirky style. While her followers love her beautiful dresses and stylish hats, it was a blue-purple ballerina-style swimsuit from the ’50s that left users clamoring for more information. “This swimsuit is 70 years old. My amazing grandma just sent me this, and it is her grandma’s swimsuit from the ’40s and ’50s in the ‘ballerina style,'” Jones says in the 23-second clip that has attracted 1.7 million views. According to Jones, the style was popular because it was flattering on plus-size body shapes and mature women. “The skirt hung loosely around the hips in a swing style,” she added. The TikToker showed off the features of the swimsuit, including the buttons on the bottom of the skirt and the ties on the back of the suit. “I wish we wore this kind of swimsuits to the beach,” one user mused. “It’s so modest and super cute, I love it!” gushed another. “I wish that style of swimsuit would come back.” “That is literally my dream swimsuit because it just seems like it’d be more comfortable,” agreed another. However, there is at least one drawback to the fabulous suit: It’s not as water-resistant as the swimmers of today are used to. “I think it is safe to say that this might be more for looks than practicality,” Jones joked after giving the rayon fabric a test run in the shower.
