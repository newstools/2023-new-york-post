Now this is serving up heartbreak with a twist. Next month you can shake — or stir — it off with your cocktail of choice at a Taylor Swift-inspired pop-up bar called Bad Blood in Chicago. Catering to those down-on-love drinkers who are anti-Valentine’s Day this year, the “heartbreak bar” — which will be open from Feb. 3 to 26 in Chicago’s West Loop area — is of course named after Swift’s 2015 No. 1 hit “Bad Blood” from her “1989” album. “Got a long list of ex-lovers?” Hop on the waitlist for this exclusive (anti) Valentine’s pop-up and get ready to plot your post breakup comeback,” reads an Instagram post from @ChicagoBucketList. A $22 general admission ticket — for a 90-minute slot that can be reserved in advance — will get you a free themed welcome drink, karaoke for you to belt out your favorite breakup songs, fun photo ops to make your ex jealous on Instagram and a chance to spin the Shake It Off Wheel of Cocktails. “Whether you want to sing about your lover, those who were never yours, those you’re never getting back together with, or those who still have your scarf, this is the perfect place for you,” reads the event page on Chicago Bucket Listers. Of course, Swift herself is currently drunk in love with actor Joe Alwyn, who she has been dating since 2016. And she has good reason to raise a glass to her success these days: Her single “Anti-Hero” just became her longest-running No. 1 hit, spending eight weeks and counting at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Meanwhile, the pop superstar is up for four Grammys on Feb. 5, including Song of the Year for “All Too Well (10 Minute Version).” And Swift’s “The Eras Tour,” which kicks off in March, has been such a hot ticket that it caused Ticketmaster to crash.
