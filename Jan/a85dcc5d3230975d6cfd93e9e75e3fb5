Bryan Cranston is ready to head back into the middle. The “Breaking Bad” star revealed Friday that he would love to reprise his iconic character Hal Wilkerson, exclusively reported E! News. “There was some talk about the possibility of doing like a reunion movie of ‘Malcolm in the Middle’,” Cranston, 66, told E! “We had such a great family on that and I certainly would be open to that if there was a good idea that came up like, ‘Oh, that would be fantastic to explore what happened to this family 20 years later.’ I can’t believe it’s already that, but that would be fun to do.” The Fox sitcom ran from 2000 to 2006 with a total of 151 episodes and seven seasons and starred Cranston, Frankie Muniz, Jane Kaczmarek and several others. Back in October of 2022, Muniz said that he knew of Cranston’s wish to revisit the show. “I know Bryan Cranston is really into the idea, and he’s kind of heading writing the script and getting everything rolling,” said the “Agent Cody Banks” actor. “So, there might be something. I would be down 100 percent.”
