Gracie Hunt — the daughter of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt — decided to wear a bikini in the snow to show support ahead of the team’s playoff game against the Jaguars on Saturday, posting a picture of the getup to her Instagram on Friday. “Thinking warm thoughts and hoping for a Chiefs WIN!,” Hunt said in the post, which featured her in a Chiefs red top and bottom along with a silver jacket as she leaned back against a tree in the snow. “Who’s ready for game day?!” Hunt is no stranger to bikini poses. She is a beauty pageant veteran who was also named Miss Kansas USA in 2021. That same year she finished in the top 15 in the Miss USA contest. The Chiefs play the Jaguars as the first contest in the NFL’s divisional round, with kickoff at 4:30 p.m. ET.
