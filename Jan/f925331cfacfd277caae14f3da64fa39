When your mother-in-law is such a legendary diva that she is known as “The Boss,” it can be one hard act to follow. Just ask Ashlee Simpson, 38, who’s been happily hitched to Diana Ross’ 34-year-old son Evan since 2014. Even though the “Pieces of Me” singer found pop stardom long before she married into the Ross family, she still gets intimidated when it comes to playing her music for the supreme Supreme. “It’s nerve-wracking at first, playing music: A, for anyone, when it’s new, but definitely her,” Simpson said during an appearance with her husband on “The Jennifer Hudson Show” Tuesday. “You’re like, ‘Oh, please like it.’” But while Jessica Simpson’s younger sister admits to getting “butterflies” from her 78-year-old mother-in-law, she and her husband got plenty of “Baby Love” from the Motown icon when they made their 2018 EP “Ashlee + Evan.” “She’s such a wonderful mother-in-law,” said Simpson. “So she’s very encouraging. And she helped us on the album too.” Still, it’s been five years since “Ashlee + Evan” — and 15 years since Simpson’s last solo album, 2008’s “Bittersweet World.” But after making a surprise appearance to perform with Demi Lovato in concert last September, Simpson is itching to get back onstage. “I keep saying, ‘I’m coming out with an album, I’m coming out with an album,’ and now I have to,” she told Hudson. “But then I keep having babies!” Simpson shares two children with her actor husband — daughter Jagger, 7, and son Ziggy, 2 — as well as a 14-year-old son, Bronx, with her ex Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy fame. But while juggling mommy duty, Simpson is ready to rock again. “Now my baby’s 2,” she said, “so it’s time.”
