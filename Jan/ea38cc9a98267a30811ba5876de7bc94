How the “Gossip Girl” stars dressed while filming was one secret they’d never tell — until now. TikTokers spotted an error during an episode of the beloved show where Blake Lively as Serena van der Woodsen is all dressed up, but only from the knees up. Lively is seen in the episode wearing a long, pink dress with fashionable earrings and a handbag. But as the shot zooms out, she’s seemingly wearing sweatpants on top of her dress not pulled up all the way, riding from her knees down. It’s assumed the cast would wear sweatpants and Uggs during filming to keep warm. “Gossip Girl was so real for letting the whole cast wear sweats and uggs just out of frame,” TikTok user @blairwaverly captioned the video — which has 2.9 million views and 274,300 likes as of Tuesday morning. Fans were shocked that the error made it into the final cut. “How did that make it into the shot lmao,” one person commented. “I’ve watched this a zillion times and never noticed this,” another said. “They got real lazy during that last season lol,” someone pointed out. “Serena would actually do this,” one user quipped. “It’s giving Zoom call outfit,” another said. “Gossip Girl” ran from 2007 to 2012, and recently got the reboot treatment with a new “Gossip Girl” on HBO Max, but the streamer recently announced it will not renew the series. The Season 2 finale of the reboot will be available to stream on Jan. 26 on HBO Max.
