They hit the ground running. Rappers 50 Cent and Eminem revealed Friday that they are in the process of developing an “8-mile” television show, according to BigBoyTV. “We’re in motion,” said 50 Cent, who’s real name is Curtis Jackson. “It’s gonna be big … You know I ain’t got no duds.” “8 mile” tells the story of an up-and-coming rapper — played by Eminem — in Detroit as he attempts to jump-start his career. Since its release, the soundtrack has dominated the billboard charts. According to the 50 Cent, it took very little convincing for the “The Real Slim Shady” singer to get on board with the idea for a TV series. “I think it should be there for his legacy, because if you don’t see … it’s important to me that they understand it,” said Jackson. Jackson also said that the television series will not be an exact copy of the 2002 film, comparing his upcoming series to the reimagined “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” reboot that aired in 2022. “I wanna be able to show and offer a lot more details — things that you would say in an interview or different things that you’ve already used that you put out there and stuff like that,” said Jackson. “You’ll see those things kind of surface in the temperament of the characters.” An official release date for the series has yet to be announced.
