Ex-Islanders goaltender and current Golden Knight Robin Lehner filed for bankruptcy in late December, according to a report from SinBin.Vegas. Lehner and his wife, Donya, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy with liabilities between $10 million and $50 million, a bankruptcy filing dated Dec. 30 in the District of Nevada states. The bankruptcy stems from an exotic snake farm the veteran goaltender purchased in 2017. That year, Lehner bought a $1.2 million collection of exotic snakes from a man named Ben Renick. A few months later, Renick was murdered by his wife and her ex-boyfriend. He made an initial $200,000 payment to Renick, but after his death, Lehner stopped making payments, KMIZ in St. Louis reported last January. The filing lists the Golden Knights, the NHL and Sure Sports Lending, the same company that is being sued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee for its role in the Evander Kane bankruptcy, as interested parties. Lehner owns RL Exotics LLC, which operates an exotic reptile farm with three employees in Missouri. Lehner estimated the value of his assets at between $1 million and $10 million. The 31-year-old is currently on Vegas’ long-term injured reserve list while he recovers from hip surgery. The Sweden native was selected by the Ottawa Senators in the second round of the 2009 draft. In addition to the Islanders and Senators, Lehner spent time with the Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks before heading to the Golden Knights at the 2020 NHL trade deadline. Lehner has posted a 152–141–49 record with a .917 save percentage over 12 seasons. In 2020, Lehner signed a five-year, $25 million contract with the Golden Knights.
