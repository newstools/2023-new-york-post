The 49ers’ WAGs had a blast celebrating the team’s 19-12 win against the Cowboys in the Divisional Round on Sunday. George Kittle’s wife, Claire Kittle, enjoyed a PDA moment after the game, while Christian McCaffrey’s girlfriend, Olivia Culpo, shared a sweet tribute to the running back. Claire, who wore a sparkling gold top and pants with feathers, jumped into Kittle’s arms while celebrating in the back hallways of Levi’s Stadium. Her red and gold Nike sneakers matched Kittle’s Nike cleats he wore during the game. “I’m so happy for you @gkittle,” Claire wrote over a photo of the couple smiling and hugging on her Instagram Story. “See you in Philly with this energy @gkittle,” she added in a separate post. Claire also shared photos with Kyle Juszczyk’s wife, Kristin Juszczyk, who was seen doing the Griddy in the stands after the 49ers’ win. Culpo was celebrating with friends in a private suite, where she posed for photos in an all-black ensemble. The model and actress shared a series of videos cheering on McCaffrey, including a postgame tribute to the star running back. “When your best friend is living his dream,” Culpo wrote over a video of the field after Sunday’s game. “@christianmccaffrey I love you so much.” Kittle and McCaffrey’s efforts contributed the 49ers’ 12th straight win as they advanced to the NFC Championship game for the second straight season. It’s their third NFC title game in the last four seasons. Kittle had an epic juggling 30-yard catch with 5:30 left in the third quarter that set the tone for San Francisco. The Niners will face the Eagles in the NFC Championship game next Sunday in Philadelphia after losing in that round to the Rams a year ago.
