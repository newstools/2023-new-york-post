Comedian Andy Dick was arrested Friday for public intoxication and failing to register as a sex offender in the wake of his conviction for grabbing an Uber driver’s crotch in 2018, according to police. The disgraced funnyman was thrown in jail again after a caller reported him drunk or possibly high on a lakeside street in the Los Angeles suburb of Lake Elsinore, Calif., at around 12:30 a.m., according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s office. Cops did a routine records check and found that Dick, 57, wasn’t up to date on his sex offender registration, which stemmed from the groping in April 2018. The former “NewsRadio” star’s most recent run-in with the law comes after he was arrested for felony sexual battery in May.  In that case, a man named “JJ” accused Dick of molesting him in his sleep. The charges were dropped, however, when the alleged victim stopped cooperating. In 2010, he was charged with sexual abuse for allegedly fondling a man in West Virginia — after a 2008 bust for allegedly pulling down a teenage girl’s top. Dick was also busted in October for allegedly burglarizing a home in Santa Barbara and stealing power tools. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.
