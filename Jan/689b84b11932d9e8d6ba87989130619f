A plane with 72 people on board crashed in Nepal Sunday morning — killing at least 68 people, according to an army spokesman and reports. The Yeti Airline plane was carrying 68 passengers and 4 crew members when it crashed near Pokhara International Airport, the Kathmandu Post reported, citing an airline spokesperson. Two infants and 10 foreign nations were also on board. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal called an emergency meeting of cabinet members after the crashed, and ordered security personnel to immediately assist with rescue efforts, the news outlet reported. Dahal said the plane was flying from the capital, Kathmandu, to Pokhara in central Nepal when it went down. A rescue team has been sent to the crash site via helicopter, the Kathmandu Post said. “We expect to recover more bodies,” army spokesman Krishna Bhandari said. “The plane has broken into pieces.” Videos of the crash on social media show flames and smoke billowing from the mangled twin-engine ATR 72. Crowds quickly could be seen gathering around the wreckage as responders attempted to rescue any survivors. It’s not clear if there are any survivors. Weather can change suddenly in Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, making for hazardous air conditions. With Post wires
