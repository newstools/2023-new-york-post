The heartless thief who allegedly shoved an 85-year-old woman to the ground and snatched her purse inside a Queens parking garage last month was identified by the NYPD. Sidiky Gassama, 32 – shown in a mugshot released by cops late Wednesday – is wanted in connection to the violent Dec. 9 robbery of the elderly victim, who was using a walker when she was pushed in Jackson Heights, police said. The callous crook snuck up behind the woman at around 7 p.m., shoved her and grabbed her handbag, containing her credit cards and personal ID, from inside the walker, according to cops. The senior was using a walker when Gassama allegedly sneaked up behind her and mugged her. The thief then sprinted out of the 74th Street and 35 Avenue residential lot to the Roosevelt Avenue subway station two blocks away, authorities said. The victim suffered injuries on the right side of her body, but did not need to be treated at a hospital. Surveillance footage captured the suspect as he entered the garage, and again when he made his escape. He was still on the loose Thursday.
