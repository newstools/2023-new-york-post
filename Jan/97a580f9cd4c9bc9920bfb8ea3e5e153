Two 16-year-old boys were shot and injured, one critically, when gunfire erupted outside of a Police Athletic League recreation center in the Bronx on Thursday night, cops said. The critically injured teen was shot in the head and the other 16-year-old was hit in the leg when bullets flew in front of the facility on Longwood Avenue near Fox Street around 8:50 p.m., according to police. Both teens were taken to nearby hospitals, authorities said. No arrests have been made. They were among a crowd of people leaving the recreation center when they were shot, sources said. Another group was passing by around the time of the shooting, though it’s unclear if that’s where the gunfire came from. Sources said investigators are looking into whether the shooting stemmed from a fight between two groups earlier Thursday or Wednesday. A worker at a nearby bodega said he heard three gunshots one after another. “Really loud boom, boom, boom — consecutive,” he told The Post. The staffer was unfazed by the shooting, saying it’s just a normal day in the Bronx. Thursday’s gun violence follows another shooting involving teens a day earlier. On Wednesday, a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot a 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy outside Campus Magnet HS in Cambria Heights. The girl took a bullet to the ankle and the boy to the leg. The wounded teens from the first shooting were expected to recover and the 13-year-old alleged gunman was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. Teens at the school told The Post they fear for their safety after Wednesday’s shooting. “It’s terrifying because it could happen to any one of us,” said Dahlia Chaperon, an 18-year-old senior at Campus Magnet.
