Lisa Marie Presley, who died Thursday at the age of 54, will be laid to rest next to her late son, Benjamin Keough, at Graceland. “Lisa Marie’s final resting place will be at Graceland, next to her beloved son Ben,” a rep for Presley’s oldest daughter, Riley Keough, confirmed to The Post on Friday. Elvis and Priscilla Presley’s only child, Lisa Marie, lost her own son, Benjamin, to suicide in 2020. The 27-year-old shot himself in the head in Lisa Marie’s Calabasas home just three months after she bought it. Benjamin is buried at the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s Memphis estate, marking the first on-site burial in 40 years, since Elvis’ grandmother died in 1980. A source told The Post that Lisa Marie was “never the same again” after the tragic loss of Benjamin. She reportedly suffered a cardiac arrest Thursday, two days after appearing unsteady at the Golden Globes. A cause of death has not been announced. “Her world really stopped in the last few years, and she has tried everything to cope, so that she could be there for the rest of her children,” the source said of Lisa Marie. In an emotional essay for People, Presley wrote about the grief and devastation she felt after losing Benjamin. “I already battle with and beat myself up tirelessly and chronically, blaming myself every single day [for Benjamin’s death] and that’s hard enough to now live with, but others will judge and blame you too, even secretly or behind your back which is even more cruel and painful on top of everything else,” she penned in August. “Nothing, absolutely NOTHING takes away the pain, but finding support can sometimes help you feel a little bit less alone,” she added. Presley is survived by her 14-year-old twin daughters, Harper and Finley Lockwood, 14, in addition to Riley Keough, 33.
