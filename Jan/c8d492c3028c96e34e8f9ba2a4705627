They’re kissing cousins — but she says it’s not for the money. It was love at first sight for Debora Peixoto, 30, when she first laid eyes on her second cousin, Anderson Alves Peixoto, 59, at her dad’s house. Peixoto, a model from Brazil, says she and her now-husband hit it off immediately and moved in together after just four days of dating — insisting the age gap doesn’t affect their relationship. “I’ve been criticized because he is older than me and for marrying my cousin, but it was love at first sight,” Peixoto told NudePR, gushing they met on a Thursday, had their first kiss three days later and were married within a mere three months. “As soon [as] I got his name tattooed, and he asked me to move in with him,” she continued. “He went to my father’s house to ask for my hand in marriage, and four days later, we were living together. Just three months later, we were planning our wedding.” The stunning model, who started making a living off saucy snaps on an adult platform in August 2021, says her husband is supportive of her career and even helps behind the scenes to film her stripping. “At first, it was supposed to be just sexy photos, but in the middle of rehearsal, my husband told me to take the top off,” she recalled. “I confess that I was surprised, but I took it off.” The couple, who have been married for six years, say they do receive backlash from people over their untraditional relationship — but they don’t let it get to them. ”In the beginning, people would say that I was just with him for a sugar daddy,” Peixoto reflected. “Other people would comment on how much younger I am than him, and he wouldn’t be able to perform sexually at my level.” But Peixoto loves her husband and job, despite what people may say. “This is the first time I’ve dated an older man, but it’s the best thing,” she gushed. “He has so much more life experience.”
