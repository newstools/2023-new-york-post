The iconic New Jersey house that served as a stand-in for the real haunted homestead in the 1979 film “Amityville Horror” has found a new owner, The Post has learned. In September, the four-bedroom, five-bathroom Toms River property listed for $1.7 million, asking that any interested buyers submit their best bids by Oct. 24. The home went into contract two days later and officially sold for $1.46 million on Jan. 24 —  $240,000 less than the asking price. Over the years, the riverfront home has seen several renovations since it was first built back in 1920. Described as a home with “timeless appeal,” the custom kitchen features an eat-in area with a bar and a center island. Additional features include a finished basement a wet bar, a movie theater, a den and recreation area, a laundry room, formal dining and a top-floor recreation room, the previous listing notes. Occupying roughly 4,000 square feet, the home has also been repainted since the film was released. It is unclear who the buyer is at this time. The home last sold in 2013 for just $350,000. Jeffrey M. Childers with Sotheby’s International Realty held the listing. “The Amityville Horror” is based on the true crime story of Ronald “Butch” DeFeo Jr., who spread terror across Long Island — where the real home of the murder is — following the gruesome 1974 slaying of his family. On Nov. 13, 1974, DeFeo — who was 23 at the time — shot and killed his parents, Ronald and Louise DeFeo, both 43, and his two brothers and two sisters, ranging in age from 9 to 18. DeFeo Jr. died in prison in March 2021. The actual Long Island home at 108 Ocean Ave. — it was originally 112 Ocean Ave. but was changed to deter tourists — last sold in March 2017 for $605,000. It was previously owned by George and Kathy Lutz, who moved in one year after the murders. But they ditched the property after only one month due to alleged paranormal activity, which inspired a 1977 book and the 1979 movie.
