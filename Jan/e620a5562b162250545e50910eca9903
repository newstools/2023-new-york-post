He’s flipping out! After sinking some $500,000 into making improvements to this California estate’s security system and air conditioning, “Black Panther” star Michael B. Jordan is now attempting a modest flip. The actor purchased the property less than a year ago. Indeed, just eight months after Jordan shelled out $12.51 million for this Encino crib, he’s now trying to get $12.99 million for it, according to the Wall Street Journal. The house, constructed in 2021, is set on just over a half acre in the tony Royal Oaks neighborhood. It has eight bedrooms and 14.5 bathrooms spread over its 12,300 square feet —  and features a clean, minimalist look. There’s inset lighting, black sills and light wood flooring galore in the main house — as well as multiple outbuildings, including a stand-alone massage room, a fireplace-equipped cabana and a two-story guesthouse. The “biggest ‘wow’ factor,” however, comes from the primary bedroom, Andrew Mortaza — who holds the listing with fellow Agency rep Bryan Castaneda — told the Journal. The main sleep suite has a connected bath, as well as not one but two “boutique store-sized” walk-in closets, as described in the listing. Amenities of the palatial, three-story home include a gym with its own hot tub, a wine room, a plush soundproofed home theater, a 20-foot-tall front door, a gated entry, an outdoor kitchen, a motor court and a decadent number of indoor-outdoor spaces throughout. The “stunning private celeb-owned compound” also has a wet bar, multiple laundry rooms and a kitchen with two islands. There’s also a pool. As for why Jordan has decided to sell after such a brief stint calling the opulent abode home, Mortaza told the Journal he doesn’t know.
