She’s sticking with it. Tessica Brown, also known as “Gorilla Glue Girl,” survived the first two rounds of Food Network’s “Worst Cooks in America: Viral Sensations.” “I want to learn how to cook because my grandma always said, ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach,’ and ‘I want a ring,'” she quipped on the TV show, per NOLA.com. Though the judges could barely stomach her signature dish of shrimp linguine, fried cod and glazed asparagus, Brown impressed them with a plant-based meal the following week. She’s now a few hairs closer to the $25,000 prize. The TikTok star‘s claim to fame came in 2021 when she plastered Gorilla Glue on her hair after running out of hair spray. She was hospitalized, and the glue left her hair stiff for a month. A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon resolved the situation after failed home remedies. Brown may have claimed the title of “worst hair disaster,” but she’s trying to redeem herself by being the best “worst cook.” The viral sensation is competing against 11 social media personalities, including comedian/actor Michael Judson Berry (@mjudsonberry) and K-pop TikToker Tina Kim (@kdramalogic). To prevent kitchen fires, the contestants prepare meals under the supervision of chefs Darnell Ferguson and Anne Burrell, who teach the wannabes how to make essential dishes. On the premiere episode, which aired Jan. 1, Brown cooked shrimp linguine, fried cod and glazed asparagus. “This is the only thing that I cook that people can hold down,” she admitted. Yet Ferguson could barely hold it down, claiming, “It needs its own ‘Worst Cooks in America’ episode.” Brown was able to strike back on her next dish, cooking potatoes that were called “a home run.” She made a black bean and mushroom burger with American cheese, pickle, mayo, lettuce and tomatoes on the second episode. If Brown wins the competition, she could use the prize money to fuel her music career and hair-care line. Or she could buy lots and lots more glue.
