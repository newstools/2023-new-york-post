Keke Palmer revealed the gag to cure acne … and it’s pregnancy! “There’s no more of the bumps. There’s no more of the raise. So I’m here to let you all know that I found the secret,” she shared on Instagram Thursday. “I found the secret to clearing up my acne, and guess what it is? You need to get knocked up. Period point blank period.” The “Nope” actress, who said she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, has been vocal about her health and skincare journey. She claims she tried everything to clear her skin, including two Accutane treatments. The 29-year-old mommy-to-be shared a makeup-less selfie Wednesday night, showing off the pregnancy glow that has her beaming with clear skin. “The reason my skin is clear is because I’m pregnant with a baby right now. Do you all understand? The baby has cleared my skin up. Get into the pores! It ain’t never laid flat like this … I’m about to be pregnant for the rest of my life!” Palmer proclaimed. While basking in her flawless skin glory, Palmer was honored with the New York Film Critics Circle’s best supporting actress award Wednesday for her performance in Jordan Peele’s “Nope.” Palmer ended 2022 by announcing her pregnancy with boyfriend, Darius Daulton, while hosting NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” in December. The multihyphenate from the Chicago area recently finished celebrating her babymoon in an undisclosed tropical location before the newborn arrives, which many fans speculate could be a girl from Palmer’s recent tweet. As the days get closer for the bundle of joy to arrive, Palmer is kicking work into full gear with her recurring role in the “Proud Family: Louder and Prouder” and two films, “Sister Act 3: Kicking the Habit” and “Being Mortal,” for her platform, the KeyTV Network. One thing is clear: Palmer is due for a big year.
