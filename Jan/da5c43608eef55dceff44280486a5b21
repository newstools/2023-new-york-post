Brandon Thomas Lee, one of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s two sons, said he “wishes” his mom “made money” off of the couple’s infamous stolen sex tape. In Anderson’s Netflix documentary, “Pamela, A Love Story,” which drops on Tuesday and was produced by Brandon, the 26-year-old claimed “things would have been different if she had made money on that tape,” but said she chose not to in an attempt to protect her family. Anderson, 55, and Lee, 60, married in 1995 after just four days of dating. That same year, their tape was stolen from a safe in their garage by electrician and carpenter Rand Gauthier, who then sold it off. That fiasco was the subject of Hulu’s 2022 series “Pam & Tommy” which Anderson claimed to know nothing about until she saw an advertisement for it. “But people made millions of dollars and she was like ‘no’ because she 100% cared about her family being OK and me being OK,” Brandon said in the doc, according to Entertainment Tonight. “I wish she would have made the money. She would have made millions of dollars if she had just signed the paper,” he said. “Instead she sat back with nothing and watched her career fizzle into thin air. She was in debt most of her life.” Brandon continued to explain that growing up, he “always thought everyone knew things about me and my family that they really shouldn’t have known, and everyone had this dirty little secret about my family.” He added that he would “fight” any one of his peers that mentioned his mother. Anderson claimed that she wanted to tell Brandon and their other son Dylan, 25, about the tape when they were “age-appropriate,” but Brandon beat her to it when he came home from school and questioned why she made the tape. “Really, we didn’t make a sex tape,” she recalled telling him, while also understanding that “a tape of your parents having sex is a whole new level.”
