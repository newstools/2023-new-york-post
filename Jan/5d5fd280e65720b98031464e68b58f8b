Celebrity photographer Waring Abbott and his wife, neuroscientist Sara Denning, are listing their Orange County residence for $5.5 million. The cozy, light-filled home — at 15 Cox Drive in Monroe, NY — sits on 38 wooded acres with scenic views, trails, creeks and ponds. The main house is more than 6,000 square feet with a library, a music room and a home office with a private entrance. It features lots of windows and glass doors on the main floor, as well as an open kitchen overlooking a koi pond. There’s also a barn that serves as an art studio space and an additional workshop. Waring has had a celebrated career, photographing everyone from Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones to Yo-Yo Ma, Oprah Winfrey, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Nixon. He’s also known for his photos of KISS — as well as Michael Jackson, ABBA, Debbie Harry, Patti Smith and Divine with John Waters. That said, one wing of the home is where Abbott keeps his 30-year-plus archive of photographs, along with a studio for his staff who work on current projects. After buying the property in 1999, the couple then spent $1.8 million developing it, building a road, a bridge, a well, the house and the barn. Now that they’ve fulfilled that dream, they are building something new on 68 acres west of the property. “My wife and I are ready to buy a fresh parcel of land and design a new house. Our creative minds need change and 68 acres on a hilltop is the new inspiration,” he said. The listing brokers are Douglas Elliman’s Nancy Strong and Jeffrey Hoffmann.
