The property where actress Sharon Tate was killed — and where screenwriter Jeff Franklin has long lived — is now available at a steep discount. The opulent Beverly Hills abode, known as “The Cielo Estate,” first listed last January for an eye-watering $85 million. After a year on the market, the price tag remains jaw-dropping, but is now $25 million less. Franklin, 68, is best known for creating the hit ABC sitcom “Full House” and purchased the property in 2007 for $6 million, The Post reported last winter. At that time, the 18-bathroom mansion was not yet completed. The previous home atop the 3.6-acre plot was demolished after Tate, the coffee heiress Abigail Folger, the celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring and the aspiring writer ​​Wojciech Frykowski were murdered inside by members of the Manson family in 1969. The new, Andalusian-style dwelling that now sits at the site of the grisly killings is palatial, measuring in at 21,000 square feet — with nine bedrooms, a detached guest house and what the broker says he’s told is the longest pool in Beverly Hills. (It measures 75 yards.) “There’s a koi pond in it,” Douglas Elliman’s Joshua Altman, who holds the $59.99 million listing, added to The Post. “It’s almost like you’re swimming with the fishes.” Other water features include a waterfall, a grotto, multiple hot tubs, a 35-foot water slide, a lazy river and a shark tank in the dining room. Dryer amenities include a home movie theater, a spa, a gym, a hair salon, an underground 16-car garage, a billiards room, a bar and a custom photo booth built into the house “because the owner entertains so much,” Altman explained. The compound is set behind double gates and a stone motor court, and entered through front doors. They lead to a two-story foyer complete with a custom staircase and a dome ceiling.
