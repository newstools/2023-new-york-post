Things got ugly between the 49ers and Eagles at the end of Sunday’s NFC Championship game. With 4:13 left and the Eagles dominating their eventual 31-7 win, 49ers offensive tackle Trent Williams slammed Philadelphia safety K’Von Wallace to the ground during a skirmish, causing both benches to clear as officials tried to keep things from escalating further. Both Williams and Wallace were ejected from the game. It was a long afternoon for the 49ers, who initially lost Brock Purdy in the first half with an injury to his throwing elbow. However, fourth-stringer Josh Johnson suffered a concussion, and Purdy had to come back into the game in the second half. Purdy attempted just four passes in the game, going 4-for-4 with 23 yards.
