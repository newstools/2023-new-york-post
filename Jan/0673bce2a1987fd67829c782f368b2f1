Erin Andrews has a bone to pick with some media members. Andrews was speaking with Charissa Thompson on their iHeart podcast, “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa,” and talked about reporters grandstanding in press conferences with athletes and having inhuman interactions. “I just have to get this off my chest,” Andrews said. “There have been a few instances or circumstances lately and also during the year that I find myself getting on the phone with athletes after they happen. You don’t have to be an a–hole. How about this? Stop worrying about trying to make a name for yourself or be clickbait with these questions that tie these guys down or put them in a bind or you want to be the person [who gets attention] in the press conference. Don’t do that.” Andrews has the opportunity to interact with athletes on a more personal level as the sideline reporter on the top Fox Sports NFL crew and she wishes other reporters would treat them more as people. “They’re not animals. They’re not pieces of meat. They are human,” Andrews said. “And I am just so frustrated with some of the s–t I’m seeing. I know people out there, they want to make a name for themselves as reporters. And I know they want to kind of stick out. You stick out in a really bad way when you treat these guys like s–t.” It is not clear which specific reporters and press conferences Andrews was referring to, but there is an archetype of what she is describing that engaged sports observers can imagine.
