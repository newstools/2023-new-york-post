The Idaho jail holding accused college student killer Bryan Kohberger will attempt to accommodate his vegan diet, but won’t buy any new kitchen equipment to cook his prison meals, according to a report. Latah County Sheriff Richard Skiles told NewsNation Latah County Jail staff is trying to satisfy the quadruple homicide suspect’s dietary needs, “but we are not going to buy new pots and pans or anything like that.” The sheriff’s comment comes almost a week after an exclusive report in The Post where a former aunt said relatives of Kohberger had to purchase “new pots and pans because he would not eat from anything that had ever had meat cooked in them.” The former aunt told The Post that Kohberger’s dietary restrictions were “very, very weird” and “it was above and beyond vegan.” The woman, who declined to identify herself, said she was previously married into the family. “His aunt and uncle had to buy new pots and pans because he would not eat from anything that had ever had meat cooked in them. He seemed very OCD [obsessive-compulsive disorder].” Besides touching on Kohberger’s jailhouse meal plan, the Latah lawman also told NewsNation the high profile suspect’s time behind bars has been nothing out of the ordinary so far. Kohberger landed in Idaho late Wednesday from Pennsylvania to face murder charges tied to the gruesome slaughter of University of Idaho students Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and her boyfriend Ethan Chapin in the early hours of Nov. 13. More details about how authorities zeroed in on Kohberger came out Thursday after an affidavit was unsealed in the case. He faces four first-degree murder charges.
