A Florida woman shot and killed her terminally ill husband at a Daytona Beach hospital Saturday and then refused to leave his room, according to police. The shooting took place around noon at AdventHealth, where Daytona Beach police said they negotiated with the woman. She surrendered around 3 p.m., the police said in an update. Patients and staff surrounding the room were evacuated, and police said they did not believe the woman was a threat to others. “No one else has been injured,” police said. The names and ages of the woman and her husband were not immediately released, but police referred to her as an “elderly female.” Daytona Police were slated to hold a press conference later Saturday to provide more details.
