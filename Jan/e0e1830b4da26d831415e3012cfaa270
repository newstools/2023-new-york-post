Think the Eagles are savoring their win over the Giants? Here was Ndamukong Suh on Twitter Sunday morning in the wake of Philadelphia’s 38-7 decimation: “Anyone seen the Giants? Couldn’t find them yesterday.” Fletcher Cox got in his shots, too. “Take over what trap,” he tweeted, with eight crying-laughing emojis attached. It figures that the Eagles heard a lot of the talk coming from East Rutherford this week about how the Giants could pull off the upset. And after beating their rivals for the third time this season, and with ease, some of them felt at liberty to rub it in. Lincoln Financial Field, which has been a house of horrors for the Giants, turned into a party as the Eagles jumped out to a 28-0 lead by halftime, putting a torch to the Giants’ upset hopes and proving that Brian Daboll’s squad still has a long way to go if it is to contend for a Super Bowl. It was the biggest margin of the three Eagles wins over the Giants this season, with the closest game being in Week 18 when the Giants rested their starters. Cox and Suh helped a defensive line that sacked Daniel Jones five times and stymied the Giants’ run game, as Saquon Barkley had just 61 yards rushing in a game where New York needed him to take over. The trash talk is, at least, well earned.
