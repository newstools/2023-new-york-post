A Florida man repeatedly bludgeoned his co-worker in the head with a sledgehammer, leaving him to die in a pool of his own blood, police said. Bryan Menocal, 31, was arrested Wednesday and charged with second-degree murder for the brutal killing that took place at his place of work in Hollywood, Florida. Police said they responded to the offices of Wärtsilä North America, a marine and energy technology company located in the 2900 block of SW 42nd Avenue before 7 a.m., where they found a worker lying face down on the floor of a fuel room, reported the station Local10. The man had visible head trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene. He has not been publicly named as of Thursday. By the time police arrived, Menocal had fled, but his colleagues said he allegedly confessed to killing the victim, reported NBC6. Witnesses also reported seeing Menocal walking around with the sledgehammer after their morning staff meeting. Cops tracked down the murder suspect in Deerfield Beach and took him into custody. According to an arrest report, Menocal is accused of “repeatedly striking (the victim) in the head with a large sledgehammer.” Police officials have not revealed a motive but described the killing as “an isolated incident between two people that did know each other and worked together.” According to his LinkedIn page, Menocal has worked at Wärtsilä North America as a diesel technician since Feb. 2022. Broward County court records indicate that Menocal has an extensive criminal history going back a decade, which includes multiple felony counts of cocaine possession.
