Patrick Mahomes’ high-ankle sprain might be a good thing for the Chiefs on Sunday. That’s according to former NFL QB Michael Vick, anyway. Vick, a four-time Pro Bowler who spent 13 years in the league, said this week that injuries helped him stay more locked in than he would otherwise. “I know this from playing at a high level and playing against high-level competition,” Vick said in an interview with TMZ Sports. “Sometimes when you play hurt, you’ll be a little bit more focused. A little bit more dialed in. Because you know you can’t really get off script.” Kansas City head coach Andy Reid confirmed Friday that Mahomes would be the starter under center against the Cincinnati Bengals in Sunday’s AFC Championship. Mahomes suffered the injury against the Jaguars in the divisional round last Saturday. While many have questioned his health heading into Sunday, the former NFL MVP has seemed confident in his condition. “Obviously, I feel like I can still do a lot of things,” Mahomes said Thursday. “You can’t fully do exactly what you’re going to be in those moments during the game, but all I can do is prepare myself the best way possible, and then when we get in the game you hope adrenaline takes over and you can make those throws when you need to.” The Chiefs are 1 1/2-point home favorites against the Bengals.
