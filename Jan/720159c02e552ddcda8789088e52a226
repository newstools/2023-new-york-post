Did you know that every year, there is a Coachella for the coolest tech products on the market? That’s right. In case you haven’t heard, an annual event called the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) happens every January, and this 2023, it finally made its much-awaited face-to-face comeback. Of course, it did not disappoint, as both small-time makers and big manufacturers alike showcased their latest innovations. The 2023 CES saw things like toilets with pee sensors, touchless faucets, AC units with a digital photo frame, and more. Functional home tools were shown, too, including the EcoFlow Delta Portable Power Station, which can power nearly your entire home in case of blackouts. With the weather becoming unpredictable by the day, you never know when you’ll find yourself dealing with an unexpected power outage. Now makes it the perfect time to invest in a power hub like the EcoFlow Delta, and luckily, it’s on sale in honor of the recently concluded 2023 CES. A trailblazer in the field of battery-powered generators, the EcoFlow Delta is designed to power up a wide range of devices, allowing you to stay powered not just in your home but even off the grid, too. It can power 13 devices simultaneously with its multiple ports, and its large inverter load enables it to power home appliances and heavy-duty DIY tools under 1800W. Thanks to its EcoFlow patent X-Stream technology, it can take your devices from 0 to 80% within an hour, or ten times the speed of most portable power stations in the market. And when it comes to recharging the hub itself, it only takes four hours for a full recharge with solar power, or roughly ten hours through a 12/24V carport. You’ll never run out of power with the EcoFlow Delta in tow. Formerly retailing for $1095, you can grab it on sale for only $999 for a limited time. Prices subject to change.
