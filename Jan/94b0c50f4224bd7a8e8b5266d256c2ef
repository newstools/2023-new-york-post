Oh poo! A toddler accidentally got a toilet seat stuck on her head during a potty-training session. TikTok user Hannah shared a clip of her daughter Autumn’s potty-training mishap. The viral post, which has since amassed almost 4 million views since being shared Thursday, shows Autumn with a child-size, white-and-red toilet seat around her neck. “POTTY TRAINING GONE WRONG,” Hannah captioned the video. Autumn seemed flushed with anxiety as Hannah attempted to pry the plastic seat off of her head. Since her attempts were unsuccessful, Autumn’s mom eventually called the fire department for help. “Calm down, wait, mommy do it,” Hannah says in the video in an attempt to soothe Autumn. “Oh lord, it’s stuck, it’s stuck,” she lamented. “I need some help guys … this is stuck on her head.” Hannah kept on trying, but the training seat still wouldn’t budge. “I’m honestly really serious, I can’t get it off,” she said. Hannah continued: “I’ve just tried to get her earrings out, it won’t come off. I don’t know how she’s got it on! Doubt she’ll do this again.” Once the firemen arrived and the potty was safely removed from Autumn’s head, she ran to hug the men that saved her life. Amused social media users commented on the video and suggested that Hannah save the footage to show to Autumn when she is older. “Please make sure you have this backed up a thousand times to make sure this is an 18th birthday gift to share with her friends and partner haha,” someone wrote. Another guffawed: “They need to show this to couples before they decide to have kids because this a 100% accurate daily life as a mom.” “I can’t imagine what you had to say to [the firemen]  like ‘hello my child has the toilet seat stuck on her head,’ ” one giggled. One added: “She’s gonna be terrified of the toilet now. she’ll never get potty trained!”
