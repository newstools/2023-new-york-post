They’re putting in more than just the tip. A Mexican couple has come into a wad of money — saving over $1,300 simply by placing $6 into a piggy bank every time they have sex. Fanny Castellanos, 26, and her fiancé Jesús, 29,   shared their frisky financial secret in a recent TikTok clip which has racked up 25 million views. The lusty lovers set themselves the kinky cash-saving challenge last January after experiencing money woes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Within one year, they saved $1,320 — meaning they got hot and heavy 220 times in 12 months. “We were surprised, filling three piggy banks was incredible,” Castellanos cooed in an interview with NeedToKnow.online, saying saving was much easier when they were enjoying “every delicious moment together.” The couple didn’t initially have a plan for what to do with their sexy savings, saying they were simply putting the money aside for unexpected bills and emergencies. However, after becoming engaged last September, they now plan to put the cash towards a lavish honeymoon. Castellanos and her husband-to-be are continuing the practice in 2023 — and they’ve now inspired other young lovers to do the same. TikTok went into overdrive after the pair shared their video, with several commenters saying they’d start copying the practice. Others, however, reacted with jealousy over the couple’s sizzling savings hack, saying they were both poor and sex-starved. “My piggy bank would be empty,” one lamented. Others said the video incited nothing but “envy,” with one frustrated viewer observing: “How lucky are some.”
