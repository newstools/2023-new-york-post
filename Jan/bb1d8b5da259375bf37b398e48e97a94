A pig appears to have got the ultimate revenge at a Hong Kong slaughterhouse — knocking over and killing a butcher with the cleaver about to be used on him. Police told CNN that the pig had been shot with an electric stun gun at the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse on Friday when it suddenly woke and pounced on a 61-year-old worker. The swine knocked over his would-be slaughterer — who seemingly dropped his 15-inch meat cleaver onto his own foot. Another worker found the butcher — named by local media as Cai — with the cleaver in his hand and his left foot bleeding profusely from the wound, police said. He was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital, but was pronounced dead, the local reports said. Hong Kong’s Labor Department confirmed Friday that it was investigating “a fatal work accident.” Police stressed to CNN that the cause of death has yet to be officially determined. The reports did not say what happened to the apparent killer pig. “The Labour Department is saddened by the death of the person and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family,” the department also told CNN. “We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. “We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation,” a department spokesman said. The city’s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department — which manages slaughterhouses — said it was “very concerned about the work accident.” “The department expressed its deepest condolences to the deceased’s family and has requested the contractor to provide all necessary assistance to his family,” the department said. It noted, however, that “the slaughtering service remains normal and the supply of fresh meat is not affected.”
