Jalen Brunson returned to the Knicks’ lineup on Monday, but recent fill-in Derrick Rose sat out their game against the Suns with a knee injury. Brunson missed the team’s entire three-game Texas trip last week with a sore right hip suffered on Christmas Day against the 76ers. Rose appeared in all three games with Brunson sidelined, but the veteran guard was ruled out of Monday’s game with what the Knicks said is a contused left knee. RJ Barrett remained sidelined for the Knicks for a third straight game with a lacerated right index finger. “He’s doing what he can, when he’s cleared, he’s cleared,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said before the game. “He’s in a similar place to where Jalen was. Each day, a little bit more. And when he’s ready, he’s ready.”
