A deranged stranger struck a 70-year-old MTA dispatcher in the face with an umbrella in an unprovoked attack at a Manhattan subway station, police and transit officials said Monday. The worker — an MTA employee of 35 years — was inside the 34th Street-Hudson Yards No. 7 train station around 8:10 p.m. Sunday when a man randomly came up to her and hit her, authorities said. “It’s my understanding that the dispatcher was leaving for lunch and she was struck by an [emotionally disturbed person] on the platform,” Subway Surface Supervisors Association President Michael Carrube told The Post. “The perpetrator hit her over the head with an umbrella.” The victim — who has worked as an MTA dispatcher for the last 12 years — was shaken up, but was not badly injured, Carrube said. Her glasses were broken during the random attack, he noted. She was treated at the scene, cops said. The suspect was still on the loose. Last week, a man struck a female conductor in the hand with a stick at the 34th Street-Herald Square station. Earlier this month, an assailant sprayed an unknown substance at another female conductor at the 81st Street-Museum of Natural History station, cops said. “The crime in the subway is out of control,” Carrube said. “We’re calling on the District Attorney to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law….It’s not an easy fix but something’s got to give here.” “The majority of our offices where my members work are on the platform,” he said. “My members are right there out in the open. It poses a bad risk.”
