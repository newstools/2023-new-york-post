According to an erroneous graphic on the CBS halftime show, Super Bowl 2023 will be played on a date that doesn’t even exist. The graphic attempted to show the bracket of teams that could advance to Super Bowl 2023, pending results from the AFC Championship game. That part was correct, but then the graphic said it’d be played on Feb. 29, 2023. Feb. 29, a date that only occurs during leap years, won’t appear on calendars again until 2024. But that day will fall on a Thursday, and as one Twitter user noted, the next time Feb. 29 falls on a Sunday — when Super Bowls are held — will be in 2032. Super Bowl LVII — which will be held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. — will actually be played on Feb. 12 at 6:30 p.m. Fox holds the rights to this year’s broadcast, and it’ll feature the Eagles and the Chiefs, who defeated the Bengals Sunday evening. Cincinnati scored two touchdowns in the second half — on a rush from Samaje Perine and a catch from Tee Higgins — to overcome a difficult first half, where their offense struggled to move against Kansas City’s defense. Travis Kelce, who dealt with a back injury and uncertainty about whether he’d even be active, caught a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes. Marquez Valdes-Scantling recorded a touchdown reception, too. The Eagles advanced earlier Sunday afternoon. They defeated the 49ers, 31-7, and capitalized on San Francisco’s quarterback uncertainty. Brock Purdy suffering an elbow injury and Josh Johnson, their fourth-string quarterback, exited due to a concussion. That meant Purdy had to return, although he couldn’t throw the ball downfield and felt “shocks.” Philadelphia’s defense shut out San Francisco in the second half, and its offense generated four rushing touchdowns to build a commanding lead.
