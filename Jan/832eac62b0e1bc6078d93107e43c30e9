Bernie Madoff’s Hamptons pad is finally getting new owners, The Post has learned. The 3,000-square-foot oceanfront estate in Montauk — which receives mentions in the recently released Netflix docuseries “Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street” — entered contract on Tuesday after spending four years on and off the market. It last asked $16.5 million; it first listed for $21 million. The final sale price is not yet known. The late disgraced Ponzi schemer was ordered to sell the property at the start of his 150-year prison sentence. It sold to its original developers — Vornado Realty Trust honcho Steven Roth — for $9.41 million in 2009, the year Madoff received his sentence. The sale partially helped repay swindled investors in Madoff’s colossal $65 billion scam. The bungalow had not changed hands since that years-ago forced sale. Situated on 1.5 acres, the residence features 180 feet of water frontage. It was fully renovated in 2011. It also comes with a heated swimming pool, the listing notes. Madoff purchased the home for $250,000 in 1980 — nearly $1 million today — The Post previously reported. Tim Davis of the Corcoran Group held the listing in a co-exclusive with Bespoke Real Estate. It’s also unclear who the new owner will be. The Post has reached out for comment. Meanwhile, Madoff’s former Manhattan penthouse was recently taken off the market after failing to secure a buyer, The Post reported. On April 14, 2021, Madoff died in a prison hospital of natural causes at age 82 — just two weeks shy of his 83rd birthday.
