Marvel actor Jeremy Renner was in “critical but stable” condition on Sunday after getting into a snow plow accident, a report said. A spokesperson for Renner told Deadline that the “Hawkeye” star was injured in Nevada “after experiencing a weather-related accident while plowing snow.” The 51-year-old actor, also known for his starring role in the Paramount+ series “The Mayor of Kingstown,” was reportedly airlifted to an area hospital near Reno. His spokesperson said he is “receiving excellent care” and his family was by his side. Renner has a home close to Reno near Mt. Rose-Ski Tahoe, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. The area along with much of northern Nevada was slammed with a winter storm on New Year’s Eve that caused 35,000 homes to lose power, with thousands still in the dark the next morning. Renner is best known for playing the superhero Clint Barton, or “Hawkeye,” in multiple Marvel movies and Disney+ television shows. The actor has been nominated for an Academy Award for his performances in “The Hurt Locker” in 2008 and “The Town” in 2010.
