A heartless Long Island carjacker tried to toss a dog he found in a stolen ride out the window — but instead dragged it along the road, leaving the poor pooch seriously injured, police said. The ski mask-wearing thief jumped behind the wheel of a 2020 white Range Rover at a BP gas station in Mineola on Monday afternoon while the owner, a 60-year-old woman, stood outside it on the passenger side, authorities said. He drove off on Jericho Turnpike — and then noticed the woman’s small white Cavachon Bichon dog was still inside the car, nestled in the woman’s handbag, Nassau County cops said. He tried to ditch the pup by throwing it out of the car at Jericho Turnpike and Mineola Boulevard. But the dog’s collar somehow got caught, causing it to get dragged along the roadway, police said. The pooch eventually managed to free itself as the car continued speeding off, police said. A passerby spotted the dog, tended to it and called 911. The animal was taken to a nearby veterinary hospital, where it was treated for serious injuries, cops said. The Range Rover was later found about 45 miles away, parked in front of 500 N. Walnut St. in East Orange, New Jersey, cops said. But the thief was still in the wind Wednesday, cops confirmed. The owner of the car was unharmed, authorities said. Cops released a photo of the suspect as he approached the car near the gas pumps, in hopes of tracking him down. Police described him as having a thin build. In addition to the ski mask, he wore gray sweatpants, a black hooded sweatshirt, white, black and gray sneakers and black gloves.
