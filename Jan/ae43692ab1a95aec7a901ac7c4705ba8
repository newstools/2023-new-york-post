Sal Bando, the captain of the Athletics’ dynasty that won back-to-back-to-back World Series championships in the 1970s, died on Friday night after a battle with cancer. He was 78. The former third baseman was a four-time All-Star who also played with the Brewers and Royals before serving as Milwaukee’s general manager from 1991-1999. “It is with a heavy heart, the Bando family is sad to announce the passing of its beloved husband and father, Sal, who last night lost his battle with cancer that began over five years ago,” the Bando family said in a statement on Saturday. “Sandy, Sal’s wife of 54 years, and sons Sal Jr., Sonny and Stef, send their love to family, friends and fans who mourn the loss of a humble and faithful man.” Bando was a career .254 hitter who recorded 242 home runs and 1,039 RBIs during his 16 seasons in the major leagues from 1966-1981. His most impactful years came in an Athletics uniform during the Swingin’ A’s era between 1971-1975 that included three straight World Series titles and two other trips to the ALCS. During that stretch, Bando finished second in MVP voting in 1971, fourth in 1973 and third in 1974. “Our hearts are broken by the passing of our Captain and our friend, Sal Bando,” Wendy Selig-Prieb and Laurel Prieb, the daughter and son-in-law of former Brewers owner Bud Selig, said in a statement. “Sal was a pillar of strength who also had a huge heart. He was unwaveringly loyal and beloved by his teammates and those who worked with him when he moved into the front office. We cherish the times we had together and the many wonderful memories he leaves us with. Our hearts and prayers are with Sandy, Sal Jr., Sonny, Stef and their families.”
