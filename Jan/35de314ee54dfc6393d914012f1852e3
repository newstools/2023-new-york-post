Damar Hamlin is headed home! The Bills announced Wednesday that the 24-year-old safety, who suffered cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during a game against the Bengals last Monday night, has been discharged from the hospital. “Damar Hamlin has been discharged from Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute, a Kaleida Health Facility in Buffalo, NY,” the Bills wrote on Twitter. “Hamlin was admitted on Monday and went through a comprehensive medical evaluation as well as a series of cardiac, neurological and vascular testing on Tuesday.” The Bills added a statement from Jamie Nadler, MD, who is a critical care physician and the Chief Quality Officer at the hospital. “We have completed a series of tests and evaluations, and in consultation with the team physicians, we are confident that Damar can be safely discharged to continue his rehabilitation at home and with the Bills,” Dr. Nadler said. Hamlin collapsed on the field last week during the first quarter of a game after making a seemingly routine tackle on Bengals wideout Tee Higgins. He was administered CPR and shocked and eventually transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center by ambulance. The game was canceled and ruled a no contest. Hamlin’s first communication upon waking up last week was to ask, in writing, whether the Bills had won the game. Doctors answered him that he had won the game of life. Earlier this week, Hamlin was transferred from the hospital in Cincinnati to the one in Buffalo.
