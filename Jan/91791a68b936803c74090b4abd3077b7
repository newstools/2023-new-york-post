A 15-year-old boy died after an argument with his stepfather at his Bronx apartment this week, cops said Tuesday. Police were called to the home on Doris Street near Lyon Avenue in Westchester Square around 4:20 p.m. Monday. By the time cops arrived, young Corde Scott had already been rushed to Jacobi Medical Center by EMS. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, police said. Investigators found the boy had suffered traumatic injuries to his neck, cops said. He had gotten into an earlier argument with his 28-year-old stepdad, but the nature of the clash was not immediately known, police said. The stepfather was questioned following Scott’s death. Cops could not confirm whether the questioning was ongoing Tuesday afternoon. No charges have been filed, and it is unclear whether criminality is suspected. The city medical examiner’s office will determine an official cause of death, police said. A spokeswoman for the ME’s office said she did not have any information by Tuesday afternoon.
