This Tiktoker won’t let it go. One eagle-eyed social media sleuth has allegedly found an Easter egg connecting Disney’s “Frozen” to James Cameron’s “Titanic.” Posted by Chloe Hutchon last month, the TikTok has since gained nearly 5 million views. “I have NEVER seen anyone find this before & i wouldn’t of either if it wasn’t for my gran watching it when i was over  I LOVE DISNEY EASTER EGGS,” wrote Hutchon. The video shows a scene in the 1997 flick “Titanic” where Jack (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) introduces himself to fellow poker players Sven and Olaf. Hutchon then plays the scene in Frozen where Olaf the talking snowman (played by Josh Gad) introduces himself to Anna, Kristoff, and the reindeer Sven. “Did Disney copy the Titanic with their character names!!???” reads the video text. Several TikTokers were left speechless. “Jack and rose are the parents of elsa and anna,” commented one user. “One of the writers from Frozen was a big fan of Titanic,” clarified one user “I think it was addressed in the BTS of Frozen 2 documentary that’s on Disney+!” “I’ve ALWAYS noticed this but wasn’t sure if they actually did copy or if it was a total coincidence,” a third person said. Some users disagreed, saying the names were simply a coincidence. “Nope. they are named after Hans Christopher Anderson… Hans /Christoff /Sven,” commented a user. “Olaf and Sven were pretty common names back then so maybes it’s that. Although this is a good theory,” pointed out a second person.
