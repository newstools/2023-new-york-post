A man whacked an MTA subway conductor with a stick in a Midtown hub early Tuesday, cops said. The female conductor, 35, was looking out the window of a northbound Q train at the 34th Street-Herald Square station around 6 a.m. when the male assailant hit her in the left hand with the stick, cops said. The attacker, who wore all black, fled on foot. No arrests have been made, cops said. The conductor was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center with minor injuries. The incident comes less than a week after a cops say a female MTA conductor was sprayed in the face with an “unknown liquid” in an unprovoked attack at the 81st Street-Museum of Natural History station.
