Heroes, zeros and the full blitz from the TCU’s 51-45 win Fiesta Bowl win over Michigan in Saturday’s College Football Playoff semifinal game. Some Heisman Trophy voters may be regretting overlooking TCU quarterback Max Duggan. After 225 yards and two touchdowns on 14-for-29 passing in the program’s biggest-ever win, he will be a forever legend at TCU and might be even more than that soon. Michigan’s offensive line has won two Joe Moore Awards in a row and has been manhandled for two College Football Playoff games in a row. The Wolverines were expected to win the trenches, and instead struggled to gain a foothold in the run game. TCU linebacker Dee Winters was at the heart of a great day on the Horned Frogs’ defense. Winters finished the game with an interception, two tackles for loss and seven solo tackles. 2 touchdowns scored by Michigan on seven trips into the red zone. TCU scored four of five times inside the 20. “There’s a winner. There’s a non-winner. But the winner was football.” — Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh
