LeBron James nearly confronted a heckler who insulted his hairline during the Lakers-Clippers game on Tuesday. The 38-year-old James had to be held back by security as he made his way to the tunnel in Crypto.com Arena at halftime, with the Lakers down 77-54, when a man began shouting expletives at him. “Hey Bron! Hey Bron!” the man, who appeared to have floor seats, said. “You better get this s–t together! With that receding-a– hairline! “Look, he mad! Look at him! You sick!” James stopped in his tracks when he heard the man, but a security guard intervened before things could escalate further. Other videos from the altercation show Lakers center Thomas Bryant and point guard Russell Westbrook standing near James while staring in the man’s direction. It’s unclear if the heckler was confronted by arena security, or removed from the game. James finished the contest with 46 points as he moves closer to passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer — but the Lakers ultimately lost to the Clippers, 133-115, dropping to 22-26 on the season. The Lakers went on to defeat the Spurs Wednesday on the second night of a back-to-back. The fan incident came after James was at the center of a separate scuffle at Crypto.com Arena on Friday during a win against the Grizzlies. Fox Sports personality and former NFL tight end Shannon Sharpe, who’s a known James supporter, had to be separated from Grizzlies star, Ja Morant’s father, Tee, at halftime when the two exchanged words court side. Sharpe later said that the situation started with Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, whom he said was “too small to guard LeBron.” James defended the “Undisputed” host — who issued an apology on the show Monday. “I ride with Shannon 365 days — 366 on a leap year — 24/7. So that’s my guy,” James said after the game. “I always got his back and he’s got mine. He can talk with the best of them, for sure.” The Lakers (23-26) visit the Celtics (34-14) on Saturday.
