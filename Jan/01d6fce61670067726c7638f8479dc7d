Coney Island’s Luna Park has some air-conditioned competition. A giant new playground for kids has cut the ribbon in Brooklyn. National chain Urban Air Adventure Park opened its first New York City location on New Year’s Eve, and the 40,000-square-foot venue was an immediate hit. (New Jersey, meanwhile, currently has six locations.) “We wanted to bring our form of family fun to Sunset Park,” owner and Bronx native Michael Karlewicz told PIX11 of his extensive fun house. The most recent installment of the national chain — which has more than 175 locations across the country — opened to a blocks-long line on Dec. 31. Its popularity was no doubt helped by a massive discount on annual membership for the first 200 guests, but initial reports were still extremely positive. “The LED is beautiful and I think it is amazing,” one 8-year-old told PIX11, further noting that “the rides are so much fun.” Tiered entry starts at $43.99 for deluxe ticket holders and goes up to $53.99 for platinum tickets. A 50%-off “Parent Pass” is also available. Attractions include trampolines, bumper cars, virtual reality, a ropes course and a climbing hill. There are also various group activity-based amusements, including a “Battle Beam,” in which children fight each other with foam bars over a plush pit. The play space brands itself as the “ultimate indoor adventure park and a destination for family fun,” according to its website, which adds, “Our parks feature attractions perfect for all ages and offer the perfect destination for unforgettable kids’ birthday parties, exciting special events and family fun.” It’s located at 4422 Second Ave.
