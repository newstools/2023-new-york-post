Chicago police officers who were executing a search warrant reportedly discovered a man who works as a violence interrupter naked under a bed with cash, drugs, and a gun in the home. Jerel Taylor, 30, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, possession of heroin and possession of a controlled substance after police raided an apartment in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago and found a loaded pistol on the kitchen window ledge along with bags of suspected crack cocaine, according to CWB Chicago. Taylor was reportedly hiding under the bed and police saw his feet sticking out from beneath the bed after a woman told them there was no one in the house. Police say they found $50,000 cash on the floor and that they also found heroin on the floor next to Taylor’s pants when they asked him where his clothes were. Taylor, a high school graduate, works full time for a safe street patrol in the area and also works with the CeaseFire anti-violence group in Chicago, according to CWB Chicago. Judge Mary Marubio reportedly ordered Taylor to pay $500 toward his bail in order to be released. Taylor has been convicted of five narcotics-related felonies since 2018, according to prosecutors. Taylor’s attorney stated that he lives in the home with several family members and therefore may not be responsible for all the items found by police. Taylor is scheduled to appear in court on Friday.
