Here’s one club 50 Cent won’t be found in anytime soon. “I think depression is a luxury,” the New York rapper, born Curtis Jackson, said on syndicated hip-hop radio show “Big Boy’s Neighborhood.” “Where I’m from, you can’t afford to be depressed.” For the 47-year-old “Candy Shop” emcee — who grew up in the tough South Jamaica section of Queens — it’s a matter of survival. “You gotta pay the bills, right? So you gotta go to work,” he said. “You gotta get up, gotta go do what you gotta do. You got people right now that’s at work that don’t feel like being there. But they got responsibilities.” Indeed, taking mental health breaks for depression is unfathomable for Fiddy, who once opined that “Sunny days wouldn’t be special, if it wasn’t for rain,” on his hit track “Many Men (Wish Death).” “When these guys get in a slump and they just decide they’re not gonna do anything — I’m like, ‘Where they do that at?’ ” he said. “I think the things you go through make you who you are.” The rapper — who became a hip-hop sensation 20 years ago with his 2003 debut “Get Rich or Die Tryin’ ” — also revealed that he’s working with producer Dr. Dre on a new album. The talented twosome, who appeared on last year’s Super Bowl halftime show together, hooked up again after 50 Cent shared that he was planning on releasing new music in 2023. Dre has been part of 50 Cent’s recording “process” going all the way back to the beginning of his career.
