A car rammed into a metal barricade outside the California home where Sam Bankman-Fried is serving out his house arrest in an intentional and malicious crash, his lawyers said Thursday. Three men hopped out of the car and told a security guard looking after the Palo Alto property, “You don’t be able to keep us out,” Bankman-Fried’s attorneys said in a Manhattan federal court filing. The trio, who haven’t been identified, got back into the car after making the threat and drove off. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, has been living at his parents’ $4 million house in Palo Alto since he was released on bail — after coughing up a whopping $250 million bond. The family hired a $10,000-a-week, armed security detail to guard the house after the accused cryptocurrency fraudster received death threats. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, didn’t provide a specific date of the alleged threat, but said it happened recently. The attorneys mentioned the incident in an attempt to shut down media requests to unmask the identities of two people who helped put Bankman-Fried’s bond, alongside his parents. In a letter to US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the lawyers said the individuals’ names should remain private due to the “significant privacy and safety concerns” they would face given the case’s notoriety. They also said the prosecutors in the case have not requested the two sureties’ identities and have no strong feelings either way. Earlier this month, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and campaign finance violations in Manhattan federal court. The alleged crypto crook has been accused of swindling investors and customers of  FTX by diverting $1.8 billion invested in the platform to his hedge fund and towards lavish personal purchases. He could face up to 115 years behind bars if convicted of all charges. With Post wires
