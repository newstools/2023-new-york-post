If you’re a Mega Millions player, this Friday the 13th could be the luckiest day of your life. The winning numbers pulled Friday were: 30, 43, 45, 46, 61. The Mega Ball was 14. The $1.35 billion prize is the second-highest jackpot in Mega Millions’ history. It was not clear late Friday whether there was a lucky player. Officials usually take a few hours after the drawing to confirm that there is a Mega Millions jackpot winner. There hasn’t been a grand prize winner since Oct. 14, over 25 drawings ago, allowing the winnings to swell to a staggering $1.35 billion. If another drawing goes by without a winner, the jackpot could surprise the Mega Millions game record of $1.537 billion, which was won in South Carolina in 2018. Six players have struck the jackpot on Friday the 13th since 2008. The chances of hitting the jackpot are slim; players have a 1 in 302.6 million chance of winning the pot of gold. Tuesday night’s numbers were: 7, 13, 14, 15, 18   Gold Mega Ball: 9   Megaplier: 3X While nobody matched all the numbers to win that jackpot, there were sixteen winning tickets sold that matched five numbers, worth $1 million each. Three tickets were Megaplier winners and were worth $3 million each. The odds of winning the jackpot is 1 in 302.5 million. There was a staggering $1.337 billion won in Illinois on July 29. Two people on one winning ticket in Des Plaines, Illinois, claimed the winnings of the jackpot in July. They chose to receive the cash option of $780.5 million.
