Ten people were shot outside of a Miami Gardens restaurant during the filming of a French Montana music video on Thursday night, a report said. The gunfire erupted in the parking lot of The Licking, a soul food joint off Northwest 27th Avenue and 177th Street, around 8 p.m., WSVN reported, citing police. Witnesses told the news outlet that French Montana was making a rap video when the chaos unfolded. Purported video of the shooting’s aftermath shared on social media showed several victims lying on the bloodied pavement as first responders and bystanders tried to assist. “Apply pressure!” a woman can be heard yelling in the background. Police confirmed to WSVN that multiple people were injured in the shooting, but did not provide a number of victims. Eyewitnesses said at least 10 people were injured. At least four victims required air rescue and were flown to an area hospital. Other victims drove themselves, police said. “We’re still working. There’s multiple shots, there’s multiple cases,” Miami Gardens detective Diana Gorgue told press at the scene. Witness Ced Mogul told WSVN the insanity escalated after someone else in the crowd was robbed of his watch. “It was like at least 13, 14, 15 gunshots. It was very rapid, it sounded like an assault rifle,” said Mogul. “I took off running, and I was looking back, but I was like, ‘You know what? Let me just duck first,’ and then people started asking me, you know, ‘Can you help me?’ When I realized people were asking for help, there was nothing you could do about it when you got shot.”
