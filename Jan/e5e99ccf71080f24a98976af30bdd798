Former Knicks forward Jared Jeffries had an exciting start to the new year. The 41-year-old Jeffries appeared on Monday’s episode of “The Price Is Right,” where he kicked off the show in winning fashion by correctly guessing the price of a car during the “One Away” game, scoring the vehicle in the process. “What a good win to start the show! Way to go!” host Drew Carey exclaimed as Jeffries excitedly ran about on stage. The internet soon joined Jeffries in his victory lap, including his Indiana University teammate, Jarrad Odle. “Dude still makes me laugh,” Odle tweeted in response to Jeffries’ “The Price Is Right” win, to which the latter replied, “Man that was so funny!!!! Life long dream. Miss ya buddy.” Elsewhere online, fans joked about Jeffries and his 6-foot-11 frame being able to drive comfortably in his new ride. “Imagine being this excited about a car you can’t even fit in?” one user remarked on Twitter, per the Daily Mail, while another quipped, “At 6’4 I cannot comfortably fit inside a Corolla .. he’ll find out.” The 11th overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft, Jeffries spent the first four seasons of his career with the Wizards before signing with the Knicks in 2006. He was traded to the Rockets in early 2010 and rejoined the Knicks a year later. Jeffries last played for the Trail Blazers before retiring in September 2013. The former athlete now hosts the series “Modern Fishing” on the Outdoor Channel.
