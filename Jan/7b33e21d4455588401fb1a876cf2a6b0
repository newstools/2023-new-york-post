It’s important to find a partner who can support you — both figuratively and literally. A viral TikTok video of a woman giving her boyfriend a piggyback ride home has gone viral, with users both amused and impressed by her actions. The 11-second clip — posted to TikTok earlier this week to kick off the new year — has been viewed over 3.9 million times. In it, a young woman tries to help her presumably drunk partner to walk in a straight line after what looks like a night out during New Year’s Eve celebrations. As they walk along the unidentified bustling street, the man — more resembling a giant ragdoll at this point — slowly halts and begins to heavily lean against the woman. Not missing a beat, the woman hoists the man onto her back and continues walking — or stumbling, really — down the street, much to the delight of laughing onlookers. Thousands of people commented on the video, many in disbelief over her quick movement and no-nonsense attitude in dealing with her inebriated partner. “What a beautiful and valuable woman,” one person said. “Blessings for that lady,” one person wrote, while a user said they could see the “pure and sincere love reflected in the action.” Others were unimpressed with her partner’s drunken state. “She deserves better,” one user proclaimed, while another said: “I hope he appreciates it.” The video was one of the latest in a growing string of clips featuring women helping their inebriated mates. TikTok searches for “Girl carries drunk boyfriend” and “girlfriend carrying drunk boyfriend” have topped an astonishing 930 million views on the platform. It’s unknown whether the user who posted the video knows the couple and where it was filmed.
