The kid from Ohio wasn’t happy to be a Buckeye Saturday night. LeBron James, noted native of Akron, had been rooting on his Ohio State football squad in the College Football Playoff semifinals, where they ultimately were dropped by the Georgia Bulldogs, 42-41. After trailing 38-24 heading into the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs outscored the Buckeyes 18-3 in the final stanza leading to a potential game-winning 50-yard field goal with a few seconds on the clock. The field goal, attempted by Ohio State kicker Noah Ruggles was not even close. And King James wasn’t pleased, immediately reacting to the miss in what will go down as his first tweet of 2023: “WTF was that!!!!!!” James then quickly pivoted by ringing in the new year by playing Madden, which his wife, Savannah, caught and posted on Instagram. He does have a point about wanting to start off the year on a high note. While he ended 2022 with 47 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists on his 38th birthday in a win over the Atlanta Hawks, his 15-21 Lakers could use some good fortune if they’re going to make the playoffs. For his sake, and seemingly his family’s, hopefully, he led Kirk Cousins and the Vikings to victory over the Colts in Madden, though.
