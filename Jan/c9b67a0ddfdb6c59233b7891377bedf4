Someone said: “Congrats my guy!!” “Hardest Gender Reveal I’ve ever seen ,” one person commented. It’s been a month of celebration as Goodman recently celebrated Anderson’s birthday on Jan. 7, penning a sweet tribute to her partner on social media. Alongside a gallery of photos of the two together, Goodman wrote: “SCREAMING AT THE TIP TOP OF MY LUNGS: HAPPY 32ND BIRTHDAY TO MY LOVE, my rock, my heart, my happy place, my goofball, my person – you are everything I’ve ever dreamed of and more.” “Thank you [for] being such an incredible boyfriend, the sweetest daddy, the hardest working man, and the most dedicated to our new life,” she continued. “You have provided me with my biggest life dream this year — to become a mommy, and I am so incredibly grateful! Im lucky to do life with you! I love you endlessly,” she concluded her post.
