A new A-list neighbor is moving into the building. Meryl Streep will join series stars Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez — as well as Paul Rudd and Jesse Williams — in the upcoming third season of Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building.” Gomez, 30, announced the casting in a TikTok video on Tuesday, where she sat among the show’s original cast while on the set of the Emmy-winning, Golden Globe-nominated series. “Could this honestly get any better?” Gomez asked, panning to Rudd. “Well, I do think it could get a little bit better,” responded the “Ant-Man” actor, whose own addition was announced in August. That’s when Streep, 73, popped up behind Gomez, jokingly offering Martin, 77, a pillow to sit against. “Marty, anything you need?” three-time Oscar-winning actress Streep asked Short, 72. “Just the tea that I had asked for a half an hour ago,” he quipped. “Meet our new and old crew! Excuse me while I scream in a pillow,” Gomez captioned the clip. Martin also shared a black-and-white photo with the new additions to Twitter, writing, “The filming of Season 3 of ‘Only Murders in the Building’ has begun! A cast to dream of.” While details of Streep’s role in the series are unclear at this point, this will be her first TV series since Season 2 of HBO’s “Big Little Lies” in 2019. Nevertheless, she still has three Emmys: Outstanding Narrator for Netflix’s 2017 documentary “Five Came Back,” Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for HBO’s 2003 show “Angels in America,” and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series for 1978’s “Holocaust.” The premiere date for “Only Murders” Season 3 has yet to be released.
