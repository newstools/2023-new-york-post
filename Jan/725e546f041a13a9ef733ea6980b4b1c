She said yes! Indianapolis Colts running back Jake Funk and former “Bachelor” star Hannah Ann Sluss are engaged after less than two years of dating. Sluss shared the exciting news in a TikTok video on Wednesday, showing off her massive emerald-cut engagement ring, which Andrew Brown, the CEO of jeweler myGemma, estimates to cost about $80,000. “The surprise at the end he had for me,” Sluss wrote in the video’s caption, referring to the words, “She said yes!” projected onto a nearby rock. The clip also features Funk smiling during the couple’s candlelit dinner. Adele’s song, “Love In the Dark,” can be heard in the background of the video, which captures the intimate setting of string lights and candles spread out in the sand. The proposal occurred during the couple’s vacation, which Sluss had recently documented on social media. Earlier this week, Sluss — who rose to fame as a contestant on Peter Weber’s season of “The Bachelor” in 2020 — shared on Instagram that the couple nearly canceled their trip due to an issue with their dog. Sluss and Weber got engaged during the Season 24 finale of “The Bachelor,” but called it quits a short time later. He briefly moved on with runner-up Madison Prewett and is currently seeing fellow contestant Kelley Flanagan. Sluss, a 26-year-old influencer, confirmed her relationship with Funk last February in a TikTok video that showed her hugging him on the field after the Rams’ Super Bowl win. They made their romance red-carpet official at the ESPY Awards in July. Funk, a former seventh-round pick out of Maryland, was signed to the Colts practice squad in November, two days after being released by the Saints. The 25-year-old running back was promoted to the active roster on Jan. 3, which came five days before the Colts’ loss to the Texans in their final game of the season.
