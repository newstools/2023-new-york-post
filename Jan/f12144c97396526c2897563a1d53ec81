In the words of SpongeBob SquarePants, it’s time to use your imagination. One user on TikTok is sharing a theory about the characters on Nickelodeon’s hit cartoon “SpongeBob SquarePants” — and viewers are shook. In the video, @asheleyspam explained that she believes that each character on the show represents a certain “disorder.” The viral 16-second clip has already racked up over 2 million likes. For example, she thinks that SpongeBob was meant to represent having ADHD, while his friend and neighbor, Squidward, may have suffered from depression. “It took me 10 years to realize that SpongeBob characters represent disorders,” she wrote in white text over the top of the video, while a narrator repeated the words in a booming, ominous voice. The TikTok creator also shared that she thinks that Patrick, who was SpongeBob’s sidekick on the show, had Down Syndrome, and that Mr. Krabs, who owned the restaurant SpongeBob worked at, suffered from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. She also added that Plankton, who was everyone’s arch-nemesis, could have had Bipolar Disorder. The Post has reached out to reps at Nickelodeon about the mind-blowing theories. “SpongeBob SquarePants” is an animated cartoon series that chronicles the adventures of the yellow sponge and his friends as they enjoy life in Bikini Bottom, where they live underwater. The series has been made into several animated movies, the first premiering in 2004, and even had a Broadway run from 2017 to 2018. Some longtime viewers were shocked when they saw the TikTok. “Now it makes sense ,” one viewer wrote in the comments section of her post. “I will never be able to watch SpongeBob the same way again,” another person wrote, complete with a crying-face emoji. One user agreed that the show had been tainted for them as well. “You really didn’t have to you know,” they said. However, not everyone was buying it. “Did you ever consider… that SpongeBob… is in fact… a sponge?????” one user wrote. Another agreed, writing, “I think there’s a chance you’re overthinking this.” “Or maybe it’s just a TV show,” one person commented. Others compared the characters to other fictional children’s creations. “Just like the characters from Winnie The Pooh,” someone wrote.
