A body was discovered in a parking garage attached to the Los Angeles Film School in Hollywood early Thursday, police said. The grim find was made around 2 a.m. when officers from the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the municipal parking structure in the 6300 block of Sunset Boulevard, news station KTLA reported. Cops said the body was found next to a gray 2020 Nissan Kicks. The car had damage to its exterior and its airbags had deployed. An LAPD spokesperson told The Post the fatal incident was related to a traffic collision, but he would not elaborate further. Contrary to earlier reports suggesting that it was a hit-and-run, the LAPD rep said the driver remained at the scene and no suspect was being sought. The person who died has not been identified, and it was not immediately known whether they had any connection to the film school. The college did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Los Angeles Film School is a private institution offering associate’s and bachelor’s degrees in show business-related majors. Noteworthy alumni include Oscar-nominated film editor Martin Pensa, Kyle Newacheck, co-creator of the TV series “Workaholics,” and David Eischen of the techno band Transoverload.
