A young man was knifed on a NYC subway train by an attacker who made an apparent anti-white comment in a spate of stabbings and a shooting in the Big Apple, cops said Sunday. The 24-year-old victim boarded a southbound N subway with three friends at Chambers Street in lower Manhattan around 10 p.m. Saturday, cops said. While on the train, a man in another group said “Oh, white people,” a police spokeswoman said. The men in the group were black and Hispanic, cops said. A fight broke out when one of the victim’s friends asked the man what he meant by the comment, cops said. One of the males then displayed a knife and stabbed the victim in the right hip, police said. The other two men punched him in the face. The victim, whose identity wasn’t released, was taken to Methodist Hospital in stable condition. When the train reached the Pacific Street Station, a 17-, 18- and 24-year-old were taken into custody with charges pending, cops said. In another bloody incident, a 58-year-old man was stabbed in the chest with a large kitchen knife after a verbal dispute at 38-33 29th Street in Astoria, Queens, around 8 p.m., cops said. He was taken to New York-Presbyterian in stable condition. There were no immediate arrests, cops said. Just before midnight in Manhattan, a 33-year-old man was found with a stab wound to his back at West 125th Street and Morningside Avenue in Harlem, cops said. He was taken to St. Luke’s Hospital in stable condition, cops said. Police were looking for video and a weapon. Four men were being sought. A shooting left a 28-year-old man wounded in the right leg in Harlem after gunfire broke out in the Frederick Douglass Houses around 6 p.m. for unknown reasons, cops said. The victim was taken to St. Luke’s Hospital in stable condition.
