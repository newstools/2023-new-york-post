He was paid a high price. John Larroquette revealed Thursday that he and the director of the 1974 slasher film “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” made a deal that Larroquette would narrate the prologue of the film in exchange for marijuana, reports Parade. “Totally true,” confirmed Larroquette, 75, “He gave me some marijuana or a matchbox or whatever you called it in those days. I walked out of the [recording] studio and patted him on the back side, and said, ‘Good luck to you!'” According to the “Night Court” actor, he and Tobe Hooper struck up a friendship when Larroquette was working as a bartender in 1969. “Tobe heard I was in town and asked for an hour of my time to narrate something for this movie he just did,” Larroquette recalled. “I said, ‘Fine!’ It was a favor.” Laroquette did eventually get paid — in cash this time — as he went on to narrate several “Massacre” sequels. “You do something for free in the 1970s and get a little money in the ’90s,” he said. “It’s certainly the one credit that’s stuck strongly to my resume.” “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” killed at the box office making $30 million out of its $100,000 budget and has since produced several spinoffs. In a twist, Larroquette revealed that he had never seen any of the “Massacre” films. “I’m not a big horror movie fan,”  explained the 75-year-old.
