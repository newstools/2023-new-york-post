The “Peach Bowl Girl” has some competition. A different female fan went viral Monday during the Cotton Bowl, when ESPN cameras caught her nervously biting her nails as Tulane trailed USC in the fourth quarter, 45-39. Meet Ellie Fazio, a Tulane student who became the talk of Twitter as the Green Wave pulled off a historic comeback win over the Trojans, 46-45, in their first bowl victory since the 2019 season. Fazio took to TikTok to share a side-by-side video clip of herself smiling and a screen recording of her biting her nails while in the stands at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. “That game was a real nail biter,” Fazio wrote in her caption, adding the hashtag, “tulanegirl.” Fazio reposted the video, which was initially shared on TikTok by Jack Mac of Barstool Sports. “One of the best decisions in college sports history was today by an ESPN producer putting this individual on my television screen,” Mac can be heard saying over in the video. “Oh my goodness gracias, look at those eyes.” Fazio joins the ranks of Catherine Gurd, a Xavier University athlete who became an internet sensation Saturday during the College Football Playoff semifinal between Ohio State and Georgia. Gurd was featured on the broadcast in the game’s final seconds, when the Buckeyes missed what would have been the winning field goal. The Bulldogs won the game, 42-41, and advanced to the national championship.
