Prince Harry’s explosive new memoir has accidentally gone on sale in Spain, five days ahead of its official launch date – and people and the press have been snatching up copies of the salacious tome. The hotly anticipated “Spare” is due to hit the bookshelves on Tuesday, but some Spanish-language copies are already in readers’ hands, Reuters reported. “A very clear launch protocol was established and communicated to all customers so that the book would not be marketed before that date,” a rep for Barcelona-based publisher Plaza y Janes Editores told the outlet. “Everything points to the fact that some customers have breached their commitment to the publisher and have put the book on sale before the agreed date,” added the spokesperson for the Spanish outfit, part of Penguin Random House. One shopper picked up two copies for a total of about $24, according to the Sun. In Spain, the 557-page book is titled “En La Sombra,” or “In the Shadow,” with “Príncipe Harry” written on the top. It is dedicated: “Para Meg, Archie y Lili… y, for supuesto, mi madre” — “For Meg, Archie and Lili… and, of course, my mother.” The customer who bought the two copies told the Sun, on condition of anonymity: “I was shocked when I saw them selling it. “They didn’t seem to know how big this was. They’re not as high-profile here. It must’ve been some kind of mistake,” the shopper added. Images published by the Sun show the book open on a page showing a young Harry with his smiling mom, Princess Diana. The page includes the caption: “Primera parte – Desde la noche que me envuelve,” or, “Part one – Since the night that surrounds me.”
