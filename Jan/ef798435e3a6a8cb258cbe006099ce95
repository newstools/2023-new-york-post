One of the suspects grabbed a knife off the deli counter as the crew demanded money from the register, cops said. Then mayhem ensued,- with the suspects throwing and knocking over entire racks of snacks and tossing random items, including kitchen knives, toward a worker at the counter, footage released early Monday shows. No one was hurt in the fracas. Police were still looking to track down the suspects Monday.
