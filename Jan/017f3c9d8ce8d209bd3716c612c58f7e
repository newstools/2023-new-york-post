It’s a busy month for Dennis Sprung, the president of the American Kennel Club. He’s gearing up for the Meet the Breeds event on Jan. 28 and 29 at the Javits Center for dog lovers and the pet-curious. It’s the largest in-person dog breed educational showcase in the country and its goal is to teach responsible pet ownership. More than 130 dog breeds — from affenpinschers and Yorkshire terriers, to crowd favorite Labrador retrievers and the more exotic like Bergamasco sheepdogs and Xoloitzcuintlis — are slated to attend. All the while, Sprung is also listing his own Murray Hill apartment — a two-bedroom, 2½-bath condo at 211 Madison Ave. — for $1.99 million. The home opens from a semi-private landing into a wall of panoramic glass windows showcasing city landmarks like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and One World Trade. There’s a great room that serves as an open living/dining room, as well as an eat-in kitchen with a separate breakfast nook, and a laundry area with a washer/dryer. An interior spiral staircase leads to the lower-level bedrooms with ensuite baths. The New York-based American Kennel Club, according to one study, ranks Big Apple dogs as the most spoiled in the country. Sprung tells us that for many years he’s owned Afghan hounds, greyhounds and Pekingese — and, fittingly, there are no pet restrictions at his building. He tells Gimme he’s selling to “move uptown and be closer to Central Park.” The listing broker is Kirsten Jordan of Douglas Elliman.
