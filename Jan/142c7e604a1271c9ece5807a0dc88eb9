Three people were killed and four others injured after a gunman opened fire rental home in a ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood Saturday — marking the city’s fourth mass shooting this week. Cops responded to calls of a shooting in the Beverly Crest neighborhood at 2:30 a.m. to find seven people struck by gunfire, the LAPD said. Three victims were found dead inside a vehicle. Four others — two in critical condition and two in stable condition — were taken to nearby hospitals. The ages and genders of the victims were not immediately released. Investigators were trying to determine if there was a party at the lavish rental home, which is worth an estimated $3 million. Police did not know if the home — located on a cul-de-sac and described on online real estate profiles as modern and private with a pool and outdoor shower — had a history of noise or other party-related complaints, LAPD Officer Jader Chaves said. Authorities have no information on suspects but are collecting surveillance footage of the area and had scoured the block for evidence. The early morning mass shooting is the fourth in Los Angeles this week and the sixth in the state this month. “This is the eleventh mass shooting in the United States and the fourth in California this week. THIS. WEEK. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action,” LA mayor Karen Bass tweeted. On Monday, gunman Huu Can Tran, 72, slaughtered 11 people and wounded nine others celebrating the Lunar New Year inside a Monterey Park ballroom before turning the gun on himself. That same day, “disgruntled worker” Chunli Zhao, 67, allegedly killed seven of his co-workers and injured another in shootings at a pair of nurseries in the Northern California city of Half Moon Bay.
