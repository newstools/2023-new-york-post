She’s never kissed a boy — but she still likes him. A 23-year-old woman went viral last month after posting a series of TikToks — which gained more than 7 million views — claiming that she and her boyfriend have never kissed and that they are waiting for marriage. Kyndel Grove posted the first of the series last month, saying that this is the first man she has dated and, because of their shared faith, would not kiss him until they’re married. “So I’m almost 24 and my boyfriend and I — he’s my first boyfriend — we’ve been dating for almost two years and we’ve never kissed,” said Grove in the video. “And before y’all call me weird and all that nonsense, because I get that all the time, we’re Christian. “We are saving ourselves for marriage, and we have boundaries,” she continued. “For me, I never want to kiss anybody unless he’s my husband because I feel like that’s a special thing.” Grove said that she loves how her relationship doesn’t “rely on anything physical.” “I think that’s neat,” said Grove. “And I don’t give a frick what any of you guys think, because I get hate all the time about it, but the only person I’m pleasing is God, OK? “And our marriage will be blessed, let me just say that,” added Grove. The second video of the series shows the couple acting out one of the comments. Several commenters praised her commitment to her boyfriend. “This is beautiful,” commented one user. “As a Muslim; I respect this,” commented another. “Girly we are all doing it wrong! THAT is an actual relationship,” quipped a third person. One person asked Grove what they did when they said, “Hello.” “Do you shake hands when you see each other,” joked one user, to which Grove responded, “No usually do a cartwheel.” Grove and her boyfriend are not the only couple who practice this. In July of 2022, Kaytlin O’Neall posted a similar video on TikTok, saying that she and her boyfriend were waiting until marriage to kiss.
