Australia’s favorite scientist has revealed a shocking fact about one of the country’s favorite beverages. Many of us love nothing better than to relax with a nice hot cup of tea, but now Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed in a TikTok clip that there are DNA traces of up to 400 insects that can be found in every teabag. “This is known as environmental DNA and can be left by something as simple as when an insect bites a tea leaf,” he said. “This DNA is usually fairly fragile, and can be destroyed by ultraviolet light and can be washed away by the rain.” He said, however, it can survive if conditions are dark and dry – like the inside of a tea bag. “Well, what does this mean?” he told his followers. “Firstly, there has been a push for people to eat insects instead of meat, and maybe we tea drinkers are part of that push. “Secondly, tea fields are a hive of biodiversi-tea.” Social media users were shocked, with many saying they would switch to loose-leaf tea instead. “Another reason to not drink bagged tea,” one person said. “Dr. Karl, stop blowing my mind,” wrote another.
