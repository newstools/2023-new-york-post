It was the mile-high fight club. New York real estate agent Eric Goldie was just plane fed up with a fellow passenger reaching into his row to open the window shade on a flight — so he took matters into his own hands. In a now-viral TikTok, which has gained nearly 6 million views, a frazzled-looking Goldie slapped away a person’s hand — twice — as they tried to open the shade behind them. Goldie posted the video in response to a comment on a previous video in which he detailed a list of annoying things people do on airplanes. Many TikTok users agreed with Goldie’s handling of the situation. “Can’t they open their own window,” questioned one user. “Who has the audacity to try MULTIPLE TIMES after being told no,” said another. “I’d just hold her hand. I have hyperhidrosis and we’re both gonna be miserable,” joked a third person. “I think this would be unlocked dormant violence in me. like broken fingers,” commented a fourth person. One user questioned who should make the decision based on the position of the window. “I get so confused when the window is 50/50 between seats,” remarked the user. “Who owns it?” Goldie later posted another follow-up video explaining the location of the window justified his actions. “I see how this can be confusing but there is no confusion on whose window this was,” he said in the video. This is hardly the first time a passenger’s behavior on a plane went viral and raised eyebrows. One couple recently detailed how their flight to their honeymoon was interrupted when they caught a whiff of the feet of the woman sitting across from them.
