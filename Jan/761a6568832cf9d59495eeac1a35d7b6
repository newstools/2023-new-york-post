The King of Pop’s story is coming to the big screen — and he’s being played by his own flesh and blood. The iconic role of Michael Jackson in a forthcoming biopic will be played by his 26-year-old nephew, Jaafar Jackson. Jaafar, who is the son of Michael’s brother Jermaine Jackson, confirmed the news in an Instagram post, writing that he’s “humbled and honored” to bring his “Uncle Michael’s story to life.” “To all the fans all over the world, I’ll see you soon,” he captioned the picture. The biopic — titled “Michael” — will be directed by Antoine Fuqua, who helmed “Training Day” and “Emancipation,” and is produced by Graham King, whose credits include the Oscar-winning film “Bohemian Rhapsody,” based on the rise of Queen in the 1970s. The script was written by John Logan, who was behind the blockbusters “Gladiator” and “The Aviator.” Michael rose to fame as a child star as a member of the Jackson 5 and later became one of the biggest stars in the world as a solo artist. The studio hasn’t disclosed how the film will address the many controversies that swirled around the pop star in his later years, including allegations of child sexual abuse. Michael was tried and found not guilty of child molestation in 2003. He died from acute propofol intoxication in 2009 at age 50. According to the studio, the film will explore all aspects of his life, “including his most iconic performances that led him to become the greatest entertainer of all time.” Michael’s son, Prince, also took to Instagram after the casting was announced, writing he “couldn’t be happier and prouder” of his cousin. “He’s been working his ass off and I know he’s going to do an amazing job,” the 25-year-old gushed in a post. “Just being himself, he embodies so much of my dad and I’m confident we are all going to do our best to show the world a part of my father they’ve never seen and that they deserve to see.”
