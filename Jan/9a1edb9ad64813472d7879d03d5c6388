Turner Sports’ Chris Haynes and former ESPNer Marc Stein are starting a podcast about the NBA, according to sources. The iHeart-produced pod, which will be called “#thisleague UNCUT” is scheduled to debut later this month. Haynes and Stein have huge social-media presences with nearly two million combined followers on Twitter. The two worked together at ESPN before leaving in 2017. Stein joined the New York Times after being let go by ESPN, but was blocked by the network from doing video or audio work as he was still being paid by ESPN for three-and-a-half more years. He runs in his own newsletter on Substack. Haynes is a sideline reporter for TNT and an NBA columnist for Bleacher Report.
