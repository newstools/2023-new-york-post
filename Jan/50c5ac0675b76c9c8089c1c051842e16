One Red Sox player has refuted reporting that Trevor Story waited to have offseason elbow surgery and tried to avoid it with rest. Boston outfielder Kiké Hernández quote-tweeted a report from USA TODAY’s Bob Nightengale — which cited an anonymous teammate and said Story was “quite aware” of the need for elbow surgery — by starting with “Full of” and then inserting the poop emoji. Story underwent an “internal bracing procedure” on his right UCL, the Red Sox announced Tuesday, and that elbow procedure usually leads to a four-to-six month recovery timeline, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan. The procedure can be viewed as “modified Tommy John surgery” with a quicker return date, per Passan. Because of the operation, the Red Sox will be without their shortstop for most of the season, and will have to adjust the left side of their infield. Story was expected to slide back to short, where he began his career with the Rockies, after spending the 2022 campaign at second base. He joined Boston ahead of last year on a six-year, $140 million deal. Next to him at third base would’ve been Rafael Devers, who just signed a 10-year contract extension to remain with the team. Story was pegged as the replacement for Xander Bogaerts when the shortstop departed for the Padres and an 11-year deal. The Red Sox finished last in the AL East in 2022 with a 78-84 record. Story played in 94 games and hit .238, and missed time at different points with left heel and right hand contusions. His best campaigns came in 2018 and 2019 — years that included MLB All-Star Game selections — with the Rockies. Story hit .291 and .294 with 108 and 85 RBI across those two seasons, respectively. Hernández, meanwhile, logged his second season with Boston in 2022 after spending the bulk of his career with the Dodgers. Across 93 games, Hernandez hit .222 with a .629 OPS. He spent most of his time in center field, with brief stints at second base (87.0 innings) and shortstop (44.2 innings).
