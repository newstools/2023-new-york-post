Aroldis Chapman has a new team after fizzling out with the Yankees. The 34-year-old left-handed reliever is signing a one-year, $3.75 million contract with the Royals, The Post’s Jon Heyman confirmed. In the winter of 2016, Chapman signed a five-year, $86 million contract with the Yankees, the largest contract ever for a relief pitcher at the time. That contract was extended by another year for an additional $18 million following the 2019 season. The seven-time All-Star had 153 saves and a 2.94 ERA with 453 strikeouts over seven seasons with the Yankees — which includes half a season in 2016 before he was dealt to the Cubs at the trade deadline and then re-signed during the offseason. Chapman struggled in 2022, however, pitching to a 4.46 ERA. His Yankees tenure came to an ignominious end when he was left off of their playoff roster for missing a team workout, for which he was fined. “It was surprising at first [that he missed the workout], a little shocking, but after the shock wore off, when you add everything up, it’s not surprising,” Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said at the time. “There’s some questions about whether he’s been in all-in or not for a little while. He’s maintained verbally that he’s in, but at times, actions don’t match those words.”
