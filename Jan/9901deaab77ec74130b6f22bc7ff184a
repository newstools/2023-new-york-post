Ja Morant was toying with the Hornets on Wednesday. With three minutes and 35 seconds to go in the third quarter, the Grizzlies point guard took full advantage of NBA rules as Memphis led Charlotte, 96-67. After a 3-pointer from Hornets guard LaMelo Ball, Morant ran 27 seconds off the clock without touching the ball in a bizarre sequence that had the Bally Sports broadcasters perplexed. Morant had Grizzlies guard Jon Konchar inbound the ball at his feet before he walked behind it as it rolled slowly up the court. He then stood over the ball with his hands on his knees with the clock running and not one Hornets player coming to defend him. “You can do this,” one broadcaster for the Hornets said, laughing. “The ball hasn’t been touched. He theoretically could do this until midnight tonight.” Another added, “I mean, we’ve seen a lot of basketball, but I don’t think I’ve seen this.” Meanwhile, on the Bally Sports Grizzlies broadcast, one broadcaster said, “Nobody’s moving up on Ja Morant so the game clock just continues to run… I don’t know what the Hornets are doing.” Another chimed in, “And the eight-second count doesn’t start until he picks it up.” Per NBA rules, the eight-second count won’t start until the ball is touched while the shot clock remains at 24 seconds. It’s a tactic that Morant has done many times prior. As Morant stood over the ball, coaches on the Hornets’ bench appear to aggressively signal for someone to run up and guard Morant. Hornets guard Terry Rozier eventually ran up the court to guard Morant, but lost his footing and fell to the floor on a screen by Steven Adams. Morant recorded 23 points and eight assists in the Grizzlies’ 131-107 victory in Charlotte, where he had relatives and friends in attendance. It marked the fourth straight win for Memphis (24-13), which is tied with the Nuggets for the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference. The Grizzlies visit the Magic on Thursday.
