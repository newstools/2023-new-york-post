University of Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett was released Sunday morning after he was arrested for public intoxication. Bennett, who engineered the Bulldogs to their second consecutive national championship earlier this month against TCU, was shown in a video taken by WFAA walking with his head down. When asked why he was in Dallas, a disheveled Bennett didn’t respond while he got into the passenger seat of a black Chevy Tahoe. Todd Shapiro, Bennett’s attorney, told WFAA the quarterback was in the Texas city training for the NFL combine. The 25-year-old quarterback was arrested at around 6 a.m. on Sunday after Dallas police responded to reports of a man banging on doors. At the scene, cops found Bennett walking inside a gated area and “determined he was intoxicated” – with police noting Bennett smelled of alcohol, according to a report. He was later taken to a city detention center and released from custody shortly before 11 a.m., WFAA reported. Bennett, who is projected to be picked up in the middle of the 2023 NFL Draft, started his college football career as a walk-on for the Bulldogs in 2017 before transferring to a junior college. After transferring back when he was offered a scholarship in 2019, Bennett waited for his chance to start, an opportunity he gained in 2021. The 25-year-old skipped out on a presser the day after he quarterbacked Georgia to its back-to-back title victory against TCU. Javon Bullard laughed at the presser when asked how the quarterback “was feeling” that morning. Former NFL scout Glenn Smith told WFAA he believes the public intoxication arrest will have an impact on Bennet in the draft. “He’s a 5’10” guy so you’re already going to have scouts start knocking him. He’s not tall enough, now he’s out drinking till the world looks flat, now he’s out till 6 in the morning, now all of a sudden things start stacking up against him,” Smith said. “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Someone will take a shot on this young man.”
