Action Network NFL analyst C Jackson Cowart is in his first season in The Post’s Bettor’s Guide. Here are his best bets for the divisional round. All lines and odds courtesy of BetMGM. Are we really buying back into the Cowboys after one good performance in a string of bad ones? Call me picky, but it’ll take more than that to convince me that Dak Prescott’s turnover woes are behind him. I suspect we’ll see a less polished Prescott against the 49ers, who have a much more fearsome pass rush than Tampa Bay and are coming off a dominant second-half showing in last week’s rout of the Seahawks. Rookie Brock Purdy has looked like a seasoned vet on such a talent-rich roster, which will have had eight days to prepare for Dallas in a matchup that already favors Sunday’s hosts. Sorry, Giants fans. As much as I want to buy into Daniel Jones as a playoff hero, I can’t get past the clear gap between these two teams heading into Saturday’s matchup. The Eagles’ rushing attack tore through New York’s overmatched front when these teams faced off in Week 14, which was also the Giants’ worst performance of the season by far. Conversely, Jones’ impressive playoff debut last week came against one of the worst defenses in the league, and now he’ll face arguably the best secondary in football — one that certainly knows him well at this point. This could get ugly. Last week: 2-0. Jaguars (W), 49ers (W) Season: 20-15-1.
