The Red Sox are keeping one of their own home long term. Boston agreed to a massive 11-year, $331 million contract with third baseman Rafael Devers on Wednesday, The Post’s Jon Heyman confirmed. Former Met Carlos Baerga was first to break the news of Boston’s extended pact with Devers. The extension, which includes a $20 million bonus, will begin in 2024, but does not have a no-trade clause. The two sides had already agreed earlier this week to Devers making $17.5 million in 2023 to avoid arbitration. Devers, 26, slashed .296/.358/.879 this past season with 27 homers and 88 RBIs. The deal allows the Red Sox to keep one of their young superstars for the long haul after losing shortstop Xander Bogaerts to the Padres in free agency.
