The family of a Manhattan mom who was killed by a stray bullet last month is calling on police in the Dominican Republic to quickly arrest the teen suspect, who is believed to have fled there. “The authority over there, they have to apprehend him because this was done to a Dominica Republic citizen so he could pay for what he did because this was an innocent person,” said Rosa Ortega, a 59-year-old cousin of the shooting victim, Valeria Ortega. Ortega, a 64-year-old mother of three, was fatally struck by a stray bullet on Dec. 26 while walking to the food store near Dyckman Street and Vermilyea Avenue in Inwood. NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Thursday they had identified who pulled the trigger in her death as Manuel Ramos — but the 17-year-old had fled to the Dominican Republic. Rosa Ortega said she believed the teen also must have had help getting to the Caribbean island nation. “The people that sent him there, they should go to jail, too, because they should have turned him in,” she fumed. Ramos was allegedly riding in a car with two others just after 11:30 a.m. on the day after Christmas when he fired out of the window at a scooter, police officials said. One of those bullets struck Valeria Ortega in the head. Ortega’s husband, Vincent Garcia who is Dominican broke down in tears Friday when The Post told him that his wife’s alleged killer was on the run in the DR. “He is from my country?” he said through a translator. “I want them to catch him.” Their son was confident authorities would catch up to his mother’s killer. “Of course, they are gonna catch him,” he said. “What he did, he is going to pay for it.”
