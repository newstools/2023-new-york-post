The 49ers edged out the Raiders on Sunday, but for the family of Las Vegas quarterback Jarrett Stidham, it was a win all around. Taking to her Instagram Stories on Sunday, Kennedy Stidham posted a touching message to her husband, who made his first career start after Raiders coach Josh McDaniels benched veteran quarterback Derek Carr earlier in the week. “So. Beyond. Proud. No matter what. We love you,” Kennedy posted, also referencing the couple’s baby girl. Kennedy, who has been married to 26-year-old Stidham since 2019, cheered on the former fourth-round pick at Allegiant Stadium, where he threw for 365 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions in the Raiders’ 37-34 overtime loss. She was featured on the CBS broadcast during a questionable call. Despite the outcome, Stidham received plenty of love from his Raiders teammates, including wide receiver Davante Adams. “I think every single person on the team said, ‘Man, get out of here with that. You balled out and you did your thing,’ ” Adams said, according to ESPN. McDaniels also lauded Stidham, whom he acquired in May 2022 following a trade with his former Patriots team. “I thought Jarrett put in a great week of work,” McDaniels said postgame. “He knows what to do, he’s been in our system a long time and has that grasp of it. Understands what to do. I thought he executed a lot of things the right way today. Gave our guys a chance to make some plays down the field.” The Raiders will close out the season on Saturday against the Chiefs. From there, it’s been reported the team will explore trade options for Carr in the offseason. Carr, who has been with the Raiders since 2014, stepped away from the team in the wake of his benching.
