Boats are meant to float, but a new concept from Italy’s pioneering Lazzarini Design Studio would also have them soar — sort of. The company has released renderings for its latest creation: Plectrum, a futuristic, 242-foot superyacht capable of traveling at speeds of 86 miles per hour above the water line — similar to a hoverboard. The seven-bedroom, helipad and swimming pool-equipped luxury cruiser is set to debut for a price of $99.31 million. “We like to remember that in 1964, shipbuilding was already capable of similar vessel construction,” the studio — which is led by designer Pierpaolo Lazzarini — said in a statement, according to Robb Report. The studio was referring to the first use of what’s called a hydrofoil, a fin- or wing-like technology that lifts a ship above the water’s surface, giving it the appearance of levitating. “This different superyacht configuration will allow much faster travel than conventional ships of a similar size,” the statement continued. The Plectrum will measure 314 feet tall, making it nearly the same height as Big Ben, and will be divided into four floors. The primary suite will compose the main body of the behemoth boat, with six guest bedrooms below. Elsewhere, there will be a helicopter hangar and a central garage, built to store either cars or water vessels, depending on the owner’s preference. In terms of outdoor amenities, there will be extensive deck area prime for sunbathing or a dip in the pool. Hydrogen-powered motors will power the beast. In terms of truly flight-worthy vessels, Lazzarini’s helium-based Air Yacht concept is capable of not just skimming the water line, but using two “floating balloons” to soar above it. “With the Air Yacht, there is a way to sail the sky without emissions damaging the future,” the studio said of the vessel, Boat International previously reported.
