For f’s sake! An artwork installation at the MTA’s brand new, $11 billion train terminal extension for the Long Island Rail Road beneath the historic Grand Central complex misspelled the name of one of America’s most famous painters, Georgia O’Keeffe. That’s one more ‘f’ than was included in her last name when it was spelled out beneath her famous quote — “One can’t paint New York as it is, but rather as it is felt” — on a wall panel mounted down on the mezzanine level deep inside of Grand Central Madison. It’s the latest, and maybe the funniest, foible to affect the massive train hall, which was beset with so many delays and budget overruns it took more than two decades and $11 billion to finish — and raised painful questions about the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s management and competence in the process. MTA officials said that the embossing was done in vinyl and can be easily fixed — but declined to provide a price tag or timeline for the typo fix. “We clearly F-ed this one up and it’s being fixed,” said MTA spokesman Tim Minton. The MTA is currently running limited service between Grand Central and the LIRR’s Jamaica hub as it continues the new station’s shakedown cruise. Officials say they will introduce an expanded schedule in the next few weeks. Bloomberg News first spotted the misprint.
