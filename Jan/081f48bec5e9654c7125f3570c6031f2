Playing for the Patriots doesn’t sound enjoyable, at least according to Rob Gronkowski. During an appearance on FanDuel TV’s “Up & Adams,” the former All-Pro tight end who spent nine years playing for New England and won four Super Bowl rings alongside Tom Brady, said that he felt depressed at times, even when the team was winning. “A regular-season game with the Patriots actually, throughout my 20s, if we won a game, the next day it felt like we still lost a game,” Gronkowski said. “And if we lost a game, it felt like you were in super depression for like two days … or like for the whole week. “So that’s what made you really want to win the games when you were with the Patriots, because you didn’t want to ever feel that depression feeling for the two days after the game. You’re like, ‘We have to win the game. We have to win the game so we have a good week so we feel good tomorrow.’” Gronkowski, a second-round pick by the Patriots in 2010, retired in 2019. He then returned to the NFL to reunite with Brady for a final Super Bowl run with the Buccaneers in 2020 before retiring a second time in June. The 33-year-old has also been open about his post-playing days, revealing on “Up & Adams” last month that two teams reached out after he tweeted, “I’m bored.” Last month, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that “the door is open” for Gronkowski to return in 2023 when Brady is a free agent. Rapoport added that he wouldn’t be surprised if Gronkowski followed Brady, if the quarterback decides to return for a 24th season. Brady and the Buccaneers were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday in a loss to the Cowboys in the wild-card round.
