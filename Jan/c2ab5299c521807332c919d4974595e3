Dolly Parton is celebrating her 77th birthday in style. The country legend gave her fans a present Thursday in the form of a brand-new single, titled “Don’t Make Me Have to Come Down There.” The singer released it in conjunction with an Instagram post of her singing the “happy birthday” song to herself. “Somebody said, ‘What are you gonna get on your birthday?’ I said, ‘I’m not gonna get, I’m gonna give.’ I’ve got a song that I’m dropping today on my birthday,” said the “9 to 5” singer. “It’s a song that came to me in a dream and I felt like it was worth putting out there. Something special — well, it’s special to me.” In the strummer — heavily featuring stringed instruments — Parton sings of an experience with the Almighty. “I had a dream about God standing on a mountain, looking down on us, saying, ‘Don’t make me have to come down there,'” explained Parton in the social media clip. “And then it woke me up. I got up — I started writing this song over a period of weeks, months. I finished it as things would come to me, and I just felt like I should drop it on my birthday. So, I hope you enjoy it.” The single’s artwork also has the feel of the song, using a black-and-white photo of a city glistening in sunlight. “Don’t Make Me Have to Come Down There” marks Parton’s first single since releasing “Bets On Us” with Cheat Codes last month. Parton also revealed Tuesday that she is collaborating with Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, Pink, Brandi Carlile, Steve Perry and Steven Tyler on an upcoming rock album.
