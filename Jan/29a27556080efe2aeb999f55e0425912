A human skeleton was discovered in an abandoned, graffiti-covered building on a University of California, Berkeley campus, officials say. School officials last week notified students that what appeared to be a human skeleton was found in a building on Clark Kerr campus, located about a mile south of the university’s main site, the university police department said. The building were the bones were discovered “has not been occupied for many years,” officials said. Authorities said the remains were “skeletonized” and that it is unclear how long they may have been there. There are no outstanding cases of missing individuals from the school, officials said. Authorities have yet to at least publicly identify the remains, and officials have not even said if the skeleton belongs to a man or a woman. A man working near where the body was found told KTVU there was a shocking amount of police activity in the area after the gruesome discovery. “We saw a lot of police activity. There was a construction site. They were like demo-ing everything out of this building and all of a sudden just stopped. The next day we saw the coroner come. A lot of police activity,” he said. The unidentified man added, “It doesn’t surprise me that much. “There’s a lot of homeless activity here, so it was an abandoned building.” The Alameda County Coroner’s Office is investigating, and the cause of death will be shared following an autopsy, officials said.
