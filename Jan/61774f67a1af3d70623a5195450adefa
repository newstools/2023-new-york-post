In case you hadn’t noticed, winter weather is here in full force and ready to wreak havoc on much of America for at least several more weeks. When braving the outdoors along the way, it’s crucial to dress in the right clothes, and few items matter more than the kind of coat you rely on. For a limited time, the HELIOS Heated Coat for Men can provide an ideal winter solution well below its standard price. Normally sold for $229, this coat is currently available at only $89.99 with no coupon necessary. Coming in a size large and colored navy, this coat earned a rating of four out of five from The Great Outdoors Magazine, which described the coat as “comfortable and non-restrictive” and noted “I’ve worn the Helios on camps in frosty weather and for walking in temperatures well below zero and in blizzards and it’s kept me warm.” Featuring four heating panels that can be controlled individually, this coat still delivers the sleek style you count on for day-to-day use. It is equipped with a covered zipper and detachable hood, features front pockets, and provides adjustable Velcro closures at the wrist to cut off access for chilly airflow. Users have precise control over their temperature settings without affecting the graphene fabric that is comfortable and durable. This warm and cozy coat can be machine-washed normally, making this a product that remains relatively low-maintenance considering the technology involved. You can also access a USB power supply via a built-in port within an interior pocket. That’s a great way to keep your phone charged up while on the move without stalling on a cold day. Beat the winter weather in 2023 and well beyond by picking up the HELIOS Heated Coat for Men for only $89.99 (reg. $229). Prices subject to change.
