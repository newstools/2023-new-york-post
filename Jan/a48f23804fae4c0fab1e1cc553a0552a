The real-life Shiv Roy has bought herself some new digs. Aussie actress Sarah Snook is starting the year off in one of New York’s most hip neighborhoods. The 35-year-old, who plays the Roy family’s only daughter on the hit HBO series, recently dropped $1.83 million on a Williamsburg two-bedroom pad. According to city records, the Emmy-nominated celeb closed on the unit in a four-story, recently constructed building on Jan. 5, Crain’s first reported. Located just off the Metropolitan Avenue L subway stop, the eight-unit residence was completed in 2022 and describes itself as a “new luxury boutique condominium located in trendy Williamsburg,” according to its StreetEasy bio. The flat, reclaimed brick facade’s symmetrical paned window design was “inspired by the neighborhood’s industrial roots,” the bio continues, adding that all of the units are “loft-like” and offer private outdoor space. Photos of previously listed units there show fully modern apartments outfitted with high-end appliances, wood floors, white walls and inset lighting. Although changing nabes, Snook isn’t going far; she had previously been renting in Greenpoint. It was in that home’s backyard that she reportedly married Aussie comedian Dave Lawson in a 2021 wedding, Crain’s noted. Although Snook herself may be content with her humble-enough north Brooklyn condo, her TV character most certainly would not be. On the show’s upcoming fourth season, Shiv Roy is set to reside in the penthouse of Tribeca’s 270 Broadway. A unit directly below Roy’s top trophy unit recently hit the market for $5.99 million and boasts over 3,500 square feet of space, four bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and sweeping skyline views, The Post previously reported.
