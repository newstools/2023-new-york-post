There continues to be smoke about a potential Sean McVay retirement. The Super Bowl-winning Rams coach has reportedly told his assistants that they can seek other employment without resistance, ESPN reported on Tuesday. And one of his most important assistant coaches — offensive coordinator Liam Coen — did just that. Coen, who spent 2021 as the offensive coordinator at University of Kentucky, is returning to the school to serve in the same role in 2023. It’s at best a lateral move and arguably a downgrade for Coen, going back to college from the NFL. It’s a clear sign that McVay is at least seriously considering walking away. There were rumors that he might do so last year after the Rams won Super Bowl LVI over the Bengals, with The Post reporting he had received a five-year, $100 million offer to join the Amazon broadcast booth. It’s unclear if he will opt to go down the broadcast path this year, but it appears more and more likely he will not be on the Rams’ sideline in 2023. The Rams finished 5-12 this season, the worst record for a defending Super Bowl champion in NFL history. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, receiver Cooper Kupp, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and a handful of key offensive linemen all had their seasons cut short with injury. To make matters worse, the Rams don’t have their first-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft (which would be No. 6 overall) after trading with the Lions for Stafford. It could be a long road back to relevance for the Rams if they don’t get healthy — which could make it easier for McVay to walk away. If he does, Sean Payton — who left the Saints after the 2021 season — was rumored to be interested in one of the Los Angeles jobs.
