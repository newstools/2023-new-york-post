A grass fire broke out at Arrowhead Stadium following the Chiefs’ AFC Championship game victory over the Bengals on Sunday. The fire seems to be at Gate 6 of the Truman Sports Complex, which includes both Arrowhead and the Royals’ Kauffman Stadium. The Kansas City Fire Department is working to extinguish the flames, though traffic getting out of stadium parking lots has increased as a result. Details on how the fire started are not immediately available. The Raytown Fire Department was reportedly on the scene as well as the Kansas City fire department. A reported 73,426 fans were on hand to witness the Chiefs beat the Bengals 23-20 to make their third Super Bowl in four years. A 45-yard field goal from Harrison Butker just before time expired sealed the win for Kansas City after Joseph Ossai’s penalty for a late hit on Patrick Mahomes got the Chiefs within range. Kansas City will face the Eagles in Super Bowl 2023 in Arizona on Feb. 12.
