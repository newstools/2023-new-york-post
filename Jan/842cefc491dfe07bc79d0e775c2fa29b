Sebastian Croft is casting a protective charm over himself. The “Heartstoppers” actor is addressing the backlash he has been receiving from fans of the Netflix series after it was revealed he would voice one of the characters in the upcoming “Hogwarts Legacy” video game. “I was cast in this project over 3 years ago, back when all ‘Harry Potter’ was to me, was the magical world I grew up with,” the 21-year-old actor said in a tweet. “This was long before I was aware of JK Rowling’s views. I believe wholeheartedly that trans women are women and trans men are men.” “I know far more now than I did 3 years ago, and hope to learn far more in the next 3,” continued the “Heartstoppers” actor. “I’m really sorry to anyone hurt by this announcement. There is no LGB without the T.” “Hogwarts Legacy” is an open-world video game that takes place nearly a century before Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series. Rowling, 57, has come under fire since 201 8 for her views regarding the transgender community forcing “Harry Potter” stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson and “Fantastic Beasts” star Eddie Redmayne to speak out against the author. “Hogwarts Legacy”  is set to be released into game stores in early February and April.
