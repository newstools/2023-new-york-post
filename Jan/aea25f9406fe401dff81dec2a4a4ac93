St. John’s season is spiraling out of control — and quickly. The Red Storm were torched by Creighton in a 104-76 loss on Wednesday night in Omaha, Neb. It was the first time St. John’s had given up at least 100 points since a 108-67 loss to Villanova in the 2017 Big East Tournament. But that Wildcats team was No. 1 in the country. Creighton is 12-8 overall, 6-3 in the Big East. The Red Storm fell to 13-8 overall, 3-7 in conference play. St. John’s showed signs of life a week ago with an 85-74 at Connecticut, then ranked in the top 10, but have lost two straight and seven of nine since starting the season 11-1. AJ Storr led St. John’s with a game-high 23 points, and Joel Soriano chipped in 18. But all five Bluejays starters were in double figures and a total of 12 players scored for Creighton. Baylor Scheierman led the Bluejays with 17 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 16 points and added five rebounds and three blocks. St. John’s actually led 15-12 early, but Creighton turned it on from there, pulling out to a 52-39 lead by halftime and putting up another 52 points in the second half as the game was never in doubt. — with AP
