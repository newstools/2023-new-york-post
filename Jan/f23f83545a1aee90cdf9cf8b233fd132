Sports betting is officially live in Ohio and New York Post readers can grab a great offer from BetMGM on launch day. Let’s review how you can claim your $1,000 in first bet insurance for Ohio sports betting and preview this SEC showdown. New BetMGM bettors in the state of Ohio can claim a $1,000 first bet insurance bet on January 1st. That’s right, you first bet placed can be fully refunded if it loses for up to $1,000 If you like defense, then this is the matchup for you. The Tennessee Volunteers come in boasting the top spot in terms of adjusted defensive efficiency. However, their opponents, the Mississippi State Bulldogs, are not far behind at No. 5. While each of these clubs is stout defensively, there has not been much to write home about on the offensive end of the court. So with those two factors in mind, the strongest way to play this matchup is to take the under at 115 or better at BetMGM. 21+. NY, CO, DC, IA, IN, MI, NJ, NV, PA, TN, WV, IA, VA, WV, and WY only.
