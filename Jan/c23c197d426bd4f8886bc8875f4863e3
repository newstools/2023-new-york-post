Isaiah Hodgins and the Giants have a “fan for life” after a sweet gesture to a 9-year-old boy living in Philadelphia. Cassandra Miller took to Twitter on Wednesday, revealing a package that her son, Thomas Miller, received from Hodgins and the Giants organization ahead of Saturday’s NFC Divisional Round game against the Eagles. “To say that Thomas’s first NFL game two weeks ago was an experience is an understatement,” Miller wrote. “That being said, the excitement just kept on coming. (For he and I both)… Last Tuesday Isaiah Hodgins (#18 of the NYG and literally one of Thomas’s favorite players) reached out to me via DM on Twitter to say he’s sorry he didn’t see us at the game and he would love to send Thomas some signed gear. “Now, I will be honest, I hesitated to post or say anything until the package truly came, and today it did. This huge NFL sports athlete truly doesn’t understand the impact of what he just did for a little 9 year old boy who simply loves football and his team. The New York Giants organization and their players truly know how to create a fan for life.” Miller included a screen grab of the direct message from Hodgins on Instagram that read: “Sorry I didn’t see your little boy! If you send me your address I’ll have some signed gear sent to him.” In her tweet, Miller also said that Giants placekicker Graham Gano played a part in the kind gesture. “Take a second to read, I promise it’s worth it,” Miller wrote. “@IsaiahHodgins – what you have done for this little 9yo @Giants fan living in @Eagles territory is priceless. @GrahamGano – you kicked it off and #18 took it to the end zone! Thank you, thank you, thank you!” In a separate tweet, Miller added: “The gravity of what he’s done as a pro-athlete isn’t lost on myself or my son. Definitely memories my son will never forget!” The Giants face the Eagles in the divisional round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Saturday night.
