The boyfriend of a Texas elementary school teacher who was shot dead in her backyard last week has been captured more than 260 miles away in Louisiana and arrested for her murder, police said. Charvas Thompson was apprehended in Shreveport, Louisiana, on Wednesday in the fatal shooting of Wendy Duan, 28, the Western District of Louisiana Violent Offenders Task Force said. Duan, 28, a language arts teacher with the Alief Independent School District, was discovered dead from multiple gunshot wounds at her home in the 1100 block of Oxford Mills Lane in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land Saturday night. Police said at the time that she was killed during a domestic incident, and that they have identified a male suspect in her killing and were looking for him. Police said Duan started dating Thompson only a week before her slaying, which followed an argument between the couple. According to Sugar Land Police Department, detectives quickly identified Thompson as a suspect after interviewing witnesses, reviewing surveillance video and confirming his vehicle from license plate readers in the area. An arrest warrant was issued Sunday charging Thompson with murder and setting his bond at $500,000. Thompson is expected to be transferred to the Fort Bend County jail. Duan had worked at Alief ISD since 2017, teaching third-grade reading and language arts at Boone Elementary School. In December 2021, Duan was named English as a Second Language (ESL) Teacher of the Year, according to a post on her Facebook page.
