Good news for FiDi families: CompletePlayground, a nonprofit family activity center, signed a 15-year lease for 40,000 square feet of retail space at Tribeca Associates’ 30 Broad St. The facility founded by CompleteBody CEO Alex Reznik will fill space that was last occupied by a New York Sports Club. The asking rent was $250 per square foot for 3,500 square feet on the ground floor and $60 psf in the basement, mezzanine and second floor. The landlord was represented by Colliers’ David Tricarico and Jake Horowitz, who commented, “FiDi retail continues to gain momentum.” Tribeca Associates principal Bill Brodsky said his team “understood that CompletePlayground had many options. We were thrilled to accommodate their needs.” CompletePlayground offers programming for children through classes in gymnastics, martial arts, rock climbing, dance and other activities.
