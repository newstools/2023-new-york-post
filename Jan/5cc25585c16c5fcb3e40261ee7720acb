The Wildcat returns for his 26th NFL season in The Post. Including the 1997-2022 seasons in the Bettor’s Guide, Cat’s record in print stands at 624-582 (53.87 percent) against the spread. The action has largely drifted one way in this affair, not particularly unusual at the time of year when the broad public often sees things similarly. Given Jacksonville QB Trevor Lawrence’s less-than-optimal toe issues, coupled with Jags wideouts’ aches and pains, we will vault to the optimal experienced side behind ace QB Justin Herbert against this beatable foe. This Monday nighter offers greater opportunity than usual for the portion of the football fan base which likes nothing better than seeing an underdog at market which should be favored. The broad football public is inclined to favor the Cowboys, which gives us greater opportunity than usual to gain significant value. Bucs QB Tom Brady is 45, but he can handle this task, and Bucs are healthier. Hav-A-Tampa, and enjoy your head start. Last week: 0-2. Raiders (L), Packers (L) Season: 17-17-1.
