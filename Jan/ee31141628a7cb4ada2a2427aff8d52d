The NBC peacock has nabbed the gold once again. The beleaguered Golden Globe Awards have returned to the network after a prolonged pause due to ethical allegations and a lack of diversity within the voting body of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The red-carpet spectacle and lavish ceremony, hosted by comedian Jerrod Carmichael, airs Tuesday, Jan. 10, on NBC and streams on Peacock. This live blog below will be updated as winners are announced.
