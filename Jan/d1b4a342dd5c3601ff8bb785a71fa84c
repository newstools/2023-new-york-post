University of Alabama basketball player Darius Miles allegedly provided the handgun that was used in a shootout near campus that left one woman dead, a report said Tuesday. Miles, 21, admitted to police that he gave 20-year-old Michael Lynn Davis the weapon that Davis used to open fire on a car in downtown Tuscaloosa — leaving Jamea Harris dead in the passenger seat, according to TMZ. Citing court documents, the outlet said witnesses have identified Davis as the gunman and cops obtained Ring doorbell footage of the tragic slaying. Miles, who was quickly sacked from the Crimson Tide basketball squad, has been charged with capital murder for the shooting. The victim — a 23-year-old mother of one — was visiting her cousin who attends the university when she was fatally shot on “The Strip” near campus. The woman’s mother called her “a humble soul” who loved her 5-year-old son, Kaine. The shooting apparently took place after an altercation early Sunday. “It appears at this time that the shooting was the result of a minor argument that occurred between the victims and suspects after they encountered each other along The Strip,’’ Tuscaloosa police Capt. Jack Kennedy said. Miles could be seen sobbing as he was hauled away by police after his arrest. “I swear I love you more than you can imagine,” he could be heard telling someone in footage from a local news outlet. The hoops player was a reserve on the team and was ruled out for the season on Saturday due to an ankle injury.
