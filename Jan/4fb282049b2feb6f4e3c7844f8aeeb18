Pete Alonso, fresh off another standout season with the Mets, will be getting a sizable raise this year, as the first baseman and the team avoided arbitration and settled on a contract worth $14.5 million before Friday’s deadline. Alonso made $7.4 million a year ago in his first year of arbitration and isn’t due to hit free agency until after the 2024 season. He led the team in most offensive categories, including homers (40), RBIs (131) and OPS (.869). Luis Guillorme and Tomas Nido also agreed to deals to avoid arbitration, as did right-handers Drew Smith, Elieser Hernandez and Jeff Brigham. Jeff McNeil did not agree to a deal, though the team and McNeil can continue to negotiate before a hearing.
