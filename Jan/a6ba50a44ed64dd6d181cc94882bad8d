Cameron Craig had a weekend that we all dream about. Not only is Craig a Bengals fan, who just watched his team smash the Bills, 27-10, on Sunday, but he also won a massive four-leg parlay – turning a $5 bet into $72,795. With a $5 free bet, Craig placed a parlay wager on four players to score the first touchdown in all four Divisional Round games – Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert, Bengals receiver Ja’Marr Chase and Cowboys TE Dalton Schultz. After hitting the first three, he was offered $1,393.56 by FanDuel Sportsbook to cash the bet out. He said he thought was a bit low, considering Schultz’s first TD price came in at +1500 – the longest odds of all four bets. He opted not to cash out. The Cowboys barely did anything on offense during the 19-12 loss, but down 3-0 – with no touchdowns scored yet – Dallas was at the goal line. All Craig needed was a Schultz touchdown. “I am going to be so weak if they give it Zeke (Ezekiel Elliott),” Craig said in a video his friend recorded as the Cowboys lined up on first and goal.. Dak Prescott faked it to the running back, leaving Schultz to roam free to the flat. He threw it to the tight end. Touchdown. “Life changing money!! Can’t believe that just happened!!!” Craig wrote in a Twitter post. Perhaps a luxurious vacation is upcoming, or even a brand new car. Or could he just be plotting out another big payday on the conference championship games? “My loans are now paid off and I’m debt free,” Craig wrote in a later post, responding to critics who seemingly didn’t see his nearly-$73K payout “life changing.”
