The Mets are still in the market for a fourth outfielder and are interested in Andrew McCutchen, sources told The Post’s Jon Heyman. It’s unclear if McCutchen is interested in a role as a spare outfielder, since the Mets have Starling Marte and Mark Canha and brought back Brandon Nimmo this offseason. Darin Ruf is also on the bench as a potential right-handed DH, but he was dreadful after coming from the Giants in a trade last season and McCutchen could be used there on occasion. McCutchen, 36, is coming off an inconsistent season with the Brewers and has lost some power since he was a five-time All-Star with the Pirates. He finished with an OPS of .700, a career-low, but was still a league-average hitter and remains solid as a corner outfielder. Khalil Lee is the only other outfielder on the Mets 40-man roster. Other available outfielders still on the free-agent market include Adam Duvall, David Peralta and Jurickson Profar.
