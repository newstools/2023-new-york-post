As Leon Rose nears the three-year anniversary of being hired as the Knicks’ president, he still has the approval of his boss. James Dolan said Friday he believes Rose has done a good job, despite the Knicks having yet to win a playoff series under his watch. “Yes, absolutely,” Dolan said on WFAN’s “Carton and Roberts” when asked if Rose was doing a good job. “Why did I bring Leon in? I’ve been doing this for like 20-something years and in my experience with the NBA … There’s things you can do as an owner that create an environment where everybody, you give them enough money to do their job, give them more money than they need to do their job [and] you can stay out of the way, which is usually the best course of action. “But you do end up picking the one guy who’s going to make all the strategy, who’s going to execute for you. I picked Leon because I believe after you look at the NBA and the game that we play, that the team with the best talent wins. You want a guy who can get you the best talent. I believe that Leon Rose is still the best out there.” Rose made his biggest splash this past offseason, when the Knicks landed point guard Jalen Brunson on a four-year, $104 million contract to lure him away from the Mavericks. “My deal with Leon and Thibs (Tom Thibodeau), I get to speak,” Dolan said. “Their deal is, they don’t have to listen.” Dolan also defended beleaguered former Mets owner Fred Wilpon and claimed New York fans have outsized expectations when it comes to their teams spending money. With Brunson playing at a high level, the Knicks entered Saturday at 27-23.
