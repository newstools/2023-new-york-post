Will Jessie James Decker and her husband, former NFL wide receiver Eric Decker, be adding another member to their roster in the future? At the moment, “it’s probably a no,” the country singer, 34, recently told Us Weekly but added that the 35-year-old Decker, with whom she shares three children, “refuses” to get a vasectomy. “I keep asking him, ‘Go make that appointment’ and he won’t. He just won’t do it,” Jessie said. “He says it takes, like, his manhood away from him. So he’s just gonna leave it, I guess.” Married since 2013, the Deckers are parents to 8-year-old daughter Vivianne and sons Eric Jr., 7, and Forrest, 4. On the possibility of potentially welcoming another child without Decker undergoing the procedure, the “Dancing With the Stars” alum told the outlet: “I mean, you know, if it happens, it’s always a blessing. “We’re not doing anything to truly prevent that.” The Deckers have long been candid about their personal lives and often get cheeky with one another on social media. For Decker’s 35th birthday last March, Jessie posted a nude photo of the one-time Jets wideout on Instagram to celebrate. “The birthday boy In his birthday suit lookin like a statue from Greece,” she captioned the snap at the time. Back in October 2020, the couple got playful with a “motorboat” shot, when Decker appeared to bury his head in Jessie’s chest. “When he motorboats me, it just shows me how much he really cares,” Jessie quipped of Decker. A third-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, Decker began his career with the Broncos before signing a five-year, $36.25 million deal with the Jets in 2014. He was released by the Jets three years later and signed a one-year deal with the Titans in June 2017. Decker announced his NFL retirement in August 2018.
