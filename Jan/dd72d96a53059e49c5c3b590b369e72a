She will always love him. Dolly Parton joined the cast of the Fox sitcom “Call me Kat” in a filmed segment Thursday to pay tribute to the late Leslie Jordan during the show’s season premiere, reports Entertainment Weekly. “Usually at a memorial, people talk about somebody. Well, I’m going to talk to you, because there is that place on the other side, and I’m certainly going to see you there, little brother,” said the 76-year-old. “You left a lot of people here with a lot of precious, precious memories. Everybody loved you, but I doubt many of them loved you more than I did.” Parton then struck up a tune to “Where the Soul Never Dies,” a song she and Jordan recorded for his 2021 album “Company’s Comin’.” Jordan died on October 24, 2022 at the age of 67 after suffering a medical emergency and crashing his BMW into a building. “I just want you to know that we all love you, we all miss you, and I bet you’re having a big laugh over all of us being sad and sorrowful,” Parton continued. “And I know that would be the last thing you would want us to be. You made us happy while you were here, and we’re happy that you’re at peace. I just want you to know that I will always love you. Goodbye, my sweet Leslie. See you over there.” The cast of the TV show paid their respects to Jordan in their own way as well. “What we’ve done here is given Phil a happy ending. What we’re really doing is mourning the loss of our dear friend, Leslie Jordan,” said star Mayim Bialik addressing the audience. “He is irreplaceable. We will miss him very much. Love, light, Leslie.”
