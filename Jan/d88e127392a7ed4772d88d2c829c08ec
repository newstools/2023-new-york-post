A British mom is schooling those slamming her adventurous school drop-off get-ups. Mom-of-one Charlie Hayes, who posts under the username Church of Strawberry on TikTok, often shares her colorful outfits of the day — but not everyone is a fan of her quirky clothing collection. The UK-based influencer, 22, responded to one of her 114,000 followers asking her thoughts on wearing revealing clothing during school runs. The mom said she doesn’t see an issue with it — and people should be teaching their children to embrace their bodies, not be embarrassed by them. “I think it’s really weird when people make it weird that body parts are on show,” she says in the clip, which has been viewed 69,000 times. Although the mom is known for pushing boundaries with her fashion choices, she’s adamant she would never cross any lines. “I’m not going to rock up on the school run with nipple pasties on,” she says indignantly in the clip. “But I feel. like, that even if I did, would it be so bad? Kids don’t give a s–t.” The mom added it’s parents who feel uncomfortable with her risqué outfits — not kids. “They are f–king kids,” she lamented. “Who is teaching them to think like that?” In other TikToks, the mom has displayed comments from users who have told her that her son will be bullied for the way she dresses. Despite some negative feedback, the TikToker has many fans in her corner. “It’s important to teach kids to protect their bodies, but not to be ashamed of them,” one user declared. “It’s almost always the parents that are judgey, not the children. They won’t even think twice most of the time,” offered another. The young mom was recently under fire for showing off her look — which included a bright red gun painted on her face — that she sported dropping her 4-year-old son, Jasper, at school. “I love this and wearing what you want to run your kid to school, but justttt maybe the wrong place to wear guns LMAO,” one user advised.
