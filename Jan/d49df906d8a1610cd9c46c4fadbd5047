Business is booming at a luxury bunny resort in Hong Kong as China rings in the Year of the Rabbit on Sunday. Bunny Style, a place where rabbits are pampered with parties, spa treatments, exercise and countless carrots, is completely booked for the Lunar New Year, owner Donna Li told HuffPost. “I think rabbits understand what people say,” Li told the outlet. “And so when I look after them, I talk to them a lot, telling them how beautiful and cute they are.” The fee to board is around $15 a night, which includes half an hour of supervised playtime. Beauty treatments cost extra. Owners are also provided with access to a live stream and video clips so they can check on their bunnies from afar. The fuzzy creatures are popular pets in the city, where apartments tend to be small, and Li herself has two. When she launched Bunny Style in June, it consisted of just a playroom where the animals could cool down from the city’s hot and humid temperatures. “To begin with, my idea was mainly about setting up a safe indoor play space with a suitable temperature for rabbits,” she explained. However, once COVID restrictions started lifting in September, she saw the need for boarding facilities and pivoted her business model.
