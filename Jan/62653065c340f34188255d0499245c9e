‘SNL’ was graced by Pawnee, Indiana’s two leading ladies — Amy Poehler and Aubrey Plaza. “Saturday Night Live” alum Poehler surprised audiences on Saturday by appearing as her iconic “Parks and Rec” character Leslie Knope on “The Weekend Update” portion of the show, reports Entertainment Weekly. Plaza, host of this week’s episode, also appeared as an apathetic April Ludgate during the segment — which was fittingly centered on local governments. “If you’re young you should get a job as a garbage man or something,” intoned Plaza. “Work for the water department, you can drain the reservoir and find all the bodies and murder clues.” “Be a dog catcher and just say you couldn’t find any,” said Plaza. It was then Poehler decided to field questions from those who “actually wanted to work.” “Parks and Rec” ran on NBC from 2009 to 2015. After the segment was concluded, the 51-year-old star remembered her own time as a co-anchor on the show. “I used to watch this when Seth Meyers did it by himself with no one else, and he made it look really easy,” she quipped. Poehler — who was on Saturday Night Live from 2001 and 2008 — later helped read the satirical headlines. Poehler was not the only person to make a surprise appearance on the program. President Biden cameoed in the “White Lotus” star’s opening monologue as well as Sharon Stone, who stunned the audience during Sam Smith’s musical number.
