Her manicurist didn’t seem to nail it. A Denver woman is going viral on TikTok for the shockingly bad acrylic nails she said she got professionally done ahead of her engagement photos. TikToker @shesaraceli posted the video Oct. 31, but the sight of her “Humpty Dumpty” nails are just now gaining traction — and sympathy — from thousands of viewers. She starts the 19-second clip with the reference photo she claims she provided the nail tech, showing a simple, elongated almond-shaped nail polished with a modern french tip. She says she left the salon with unappealing circles that were almost half white and pink, rather than delicately tipped in white. “The worst thing ever! Especially for my engagement announcement,” she captioned the  video. While the TikToker referred to her botched job as her “Humpty Dumpty nails,” other users likened them to googly eyes and baby spoons. “You asked for almond shape and straight up got pistachios,” one astounded viewer cracked. “Girl, I gasped out loud,” another wheezed. Others questioned why she didn’t stop the nail tech if she was unhappy with the result. “You sat there for 10 whole fingers,” one person laughed. “Okay, but what do your natural nail beds actually look like? LOL it might be your nail beds,” another suggested. She responded to the blame in a follow-up video with a montage of her previously well-done trips to the nail salon. “I love how invested people are. I went to sleep and came back to people blaming my nails,” she wrote. Luckily, the bride-to-be said she was able to get her claws fixed before they were forever documented in her engagement pictures. “I went back the next day but they still looked a hot mess! I had to get them fixed by my usual nail tech! Never cheating on her again!” she declared in the comments. Nail fails seem to be all the rage these days, from a bizarre nipple design to the controversial Russian manicure.
