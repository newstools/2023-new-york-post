A 13-year-old boy was killed in a fire that erupted inside his Brooklyn apartment building Sunday, officials said. The teen, Dillon Waldren-Dickson, was found gravely injured inside the seven-story building on Snyder Avenue near East 25th Street in East Flatbush following the blaze that broke out on the fifth floor around 10:30 a.m., according to the NYPD and FDNY. He was rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. A 50-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man also injured in the fire were taken to the same hospital, where they were listed in stable condition. The relationships between the victims were not immediately known. A firefighter suffered serious injuries, and two other firefighters sustained minor injuries, the FDNY said. Twenty-five FDNY units, including 106 firefighters, responded to the scene. The fire was placed under control around 11:40 a.m., the FDNY said. The cause of the fire remained under investigation Monday morning.
