The Buffalo Bills’ trainer is getting his flowers. After the news that Bills safety Damar Hamlin is “awake” and has “shown remarkable improvement” after suffering cardiac arrest on Monday night, his teammate Dion Dawkins is praising trainer Denny Kellington. “Denny Kellington let’s praise this name and person for reviving Our Brother Damar on the field,” Dawkins, a left tackle who made the Pro Bowl in 2021, tweeted on Thursday. “Denny gave CPR and chest compressions to get his Heart Back Beating #DennyKellington And also thank you to all the doctors and Medical professionals that have helped and assisted.” Hamlin collapsed on the field after tackling Bengals wideout Tee Higgins in Buffalo’s game  on Monday and was transported to the hospital by ambulance. Thursday, the Bills provided some positive news. “Per the physicians caring for Damar Hamlin at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Damar has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours,” the organization tweeted. “While still critically ill, he has demonstrated that he appears to be neurologically intact. His lungs continue to heal and he is making steady progress. We are grateful for the love and support we have received.” At a press conference on Thursday, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center pointed to how the on-field CPR was a key part of preserving Hamlin’s neurological function. They also noted it was “fair to say” that it would have been a different outcome if it had taken a few extra minutes to get Hamlin to emergency care. Reports Thursday indicated that the NFL will not resume the Bills-Bengals game and is considering different options for the playoffs, including a neutral site AFC Championship. The Bills had a walkthrough on Wednesday and are resuming practice on Thursday. They host the Patriots on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.
