Rise ‘n shine… Kylie Jenner has finally revealed how to pronounce her son’s name. After months of anticipation, Jenner shared on Instagram this week that she and Travis Scott have named their son “Aire.” She also showed snaps of the 11-month-old’s face for the first time. However, Jenner cleared up some confusion on how to pronounce her son’s name, after a fan account on Instagram, @kyliesnapchat, wondered if it was pronounced “air” or “airey.” “AIR ,” she wrote in response to the post. A source claimed to People that the name means “Lion of God.” Shortly after Jenner’s son was born last February, the reality star announced that she and longtime partner Scott had named the baby boy “Wolf Webster,” only to take it back a few weeks later. At the time, the Kylie Cosmetics mogul explained that the name just didn’t “feel like it was him.” “We really didn’t have a name [going in],” she told momager Kris Jenner during a September episode of their Hulu show, “The Kardashians.” “We thought it was going to come to us when we saw him, and it didn’t.” Jenner also explained that she felt pressured to give the new baby a name, because otherwise, she claimed, the hospital would register him without a “name or Social Security number.” However, it looks like the “Kardashian’s” star finally settled on a name for real this time, and she shared a carousel of photos on Instagram this week of her son ahead of his first birthday. In one photo, Aire posed in a black beanie while wearing a pair of pajamas with cars on them, and in another, he snuggled and laughed with mom Jenner while posing for a professional pic. It is unclear if Jenner also changed his middle name, “Jacques,” as it was on his birth certificate, according to records obtained by TMZ. Aire joins big sister, 4-year-old Stormi Webster, who the former “Life of Kylie” star also shares with Scott, though it currently appears that the two are on the rocks.
