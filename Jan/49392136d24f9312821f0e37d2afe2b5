It’s not quite “you come at the king, you best not miss,” nor is it “speak of the devil, and he shall appear.” Perhaps this is somewhere in between. Regardless, Draymond Green has found himself in yet another verbal tussle in public with a peer. This time, it involves Evan Turner, who has been co-hosting the Point Forward Podcast with Andre Iguodala, part of Dan Le Batard and John Skipper’s Meadowlark Media company. On the podcast, Turner referred to the Warriors dynasty, which saw the team reach the NBA Finals from 2015-2019 consecutively — winning titles in 2015, 2017, and 2018 — as “unfair” and “lame.” Turner himself was a victim of the Warriors’ run, having played on the Portland Trail Blazers from 2016-2019, the last season of which saw them swept by a Kevin Durant-less Golden State in the Western Conference finals. Turner’s co-host, Iguodala, was also a prominent player on those Warrior teams. “Y’all won a lot of championships, but it was lame as f–k,” Turner said bluntly. When Iguodala pointed out that the Warriors had just won a championship this past season, led by Steph Curry, Turner quickly responded. “That’s perfectly fine!” he said. “I’m talking about when you lame ass n––s did that for two or three straight years; that was lame as f–k.” Green’s reply was written on his Instagram, where he admitted to only hearing this clip and not the full conversation. “Let me start by saying this is the only soundbite of this whole episode that I’ve heard,” Green said. “So I have no context. Dominating is lame? This sounds like someone who got they ass kicked often! Good work fellas.” Green and Iguodala are part of a Warriors core with four championships since the 2014-15 season, two of which were won without Durant. However, to Turner’s point, the NBA has felt more wide open since the dismantling of their dynasty in the summer of 2019 as it pertains to championship contenders. However, the Durant-less Warriors did win another championship last season.
