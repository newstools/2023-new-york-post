Hilaria Baldwin delivered stone-cold glares as she picked up her kids after school Thursday, hours after it was announced her husband Alec Baldwin could be sent to prison for five years. Hilaria stared straight ahead with a solemn, determined look as she breezed past photographers to pick up the seven kids she shares with the actor from an SUV double-parked outside their Greenwich Village home. The yoga instructor — who has faced scrutiny for allegedly faking her Spanish accent and heritage — had the hood of her brown sweatshirt, which read “Human,” pulled over her head as she stormed outside. She also sported crocodile-textured leggings and bejeweled black slippers. Just a few hours earlier, New Mexico prosecutors brought two involuntary manslaughter charges down on Baldwin for accidentally shooting cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of “Rust” last year. The film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has also been hit with the same charges. Baldwin maintains he did not know a real bullet was inside the prop gun when he fired it. Hutchins died shortly after she was shot. “If any one of these three people — Alec Baldwin, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, or David Halls — had done their job, Halyna Hutchins would be alive today. It’s that simple,” special prosecutor Andrea Reeb said. If convicted, Baldwin could be sentenced to five years in prison. According to his lawyer, Baldwin plans on fighting the manslaughter charges, claiming it was not his responsibility that the prop gun was equipped with deadly bullets.
