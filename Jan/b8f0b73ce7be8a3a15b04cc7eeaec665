The wheels of awards season just keep on turning. Hot off the heels of the 2023 Golden Globes on Tuesday night, the SAG Award nominations are here. The 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards nods were announced on Wednesday, presented by actresses “Emily in Paris” star Ashley Park and “White Lotus” actress Haley Lu Richardson. The ceremony will be held on Feb. 26, at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles. This year, both TNT and TBS will not be airing the show and instead, the event will air on Netflix’s YouTube channel starting at 8 p.m EST. Another big change will be coming to the awards, with Netflix broadcasting the bash exclusively, starting in 2024. Fan favorite films competing for the gold include projects such as “The Fabelmans,” “Babylon,” “The Crown,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.” Keep reading for the full list of nominations for the 2023 SAG Awards.
