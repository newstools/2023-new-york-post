Fans and current athletes are not the only ones upset by Skip Bayless’ comments in the immediate aftermath of Damar Hamlin’s life-threatening injury. Giants legend and Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, an NFL analyst on Fox, whose network airs Bayless’ television show “Undisputed” on Fox Sports 1, seemingly called out Bayless without naming him on Sunday when addressing the reaction to Hamlin’s collapse on “Monday Night Football.” “You spoke about humanity, but there were things done here, by someone here at this network, that were inhumane,” Strahan said Sunday morning on Fox’s pregame show. “I’m sorry to take this route, but I just felt like sensible people and sensible human beings have a heart. They understand that your words and what you say really have an impact on that young man’s family. “So all the attention should be on this young man and his recovery. For sensible people like us here, to say that it didn’t affect anybody at this network, nobody at this network minded — that’s a lie,” Strahan continued. “Obviously didn’t talk to us. Because it matters to us and it matters to any sensible human being that this young man’s life was bigger than any football game.” Bayless got himself into hot water with a tweet on Monday night, minutes after the Bills-Bengals game was halted when Hamlin went into cardiac arrest. “No doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of this game – but how?” Bayless tweeted as medical personnel tended to Hamlin on the field in Cincinnati. “This late in the season, a game of this magnitude is crucial to the regular-season outcome … which suddenly seems so irrelevant.” Then, on his Wednesday morning show, Bayless got into it with co-host Shannon Sharpe, who made it known he disagreed with the tweet. “I was under the impression you weren’t going to bring this up because no one had a problem with that tweet,” Bayless claimed in response.
