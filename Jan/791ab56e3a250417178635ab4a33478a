Pamela Anderson is telling her story — the way she wants it to be told. In a trailer released Tuesday for a Netflix documentary about her, the 55-year-old “Baywatch” star says that reliving 1996 — the year her sex tape with ex-husband Tommy Lee was leaked — for the doc made her feel “sick.” “I blocked that stolen tape out of my life in order to survive, and now that it’s all coming up again, I feel sick,” she says in the two-minute-long trailer for “Pamela: A Love Story,” which drops Jan. 31. “I wanna take control of the narrative for the first time,” the Playboy model declares. The infamous stolen sex tape was the center of the recent Hulu miniseries “Pam & Tommy,”  starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan, which Anderson reportedly has not seen. “I do know she’ll never, never watch this,” a source told Entertainment Weekly in early 2022. “Not even years from now. Not even the trailer.” In the trailer, Anderson also touches on feeling like an outsider in Hollywood, admitting no one took her seriously as an actress. “I didn’t feel like I had a lot of respect,” she recalled. “I had to make a career out of the pieces left, but I’m not the damsel in distress. I put myself in crazy situations, and survived them.” Another section shows a clip of TV personality Ruby Wax asking Anderson if she wanted to “be a serious actress,” with Anderson replying: “I am a serious actress.” “Pamela: A Love Story” is, according to the show’s description, “an intimate and humanizing portrait of one of the world’s most famous blonde bombshells” and “follows the trajectory of Pamela Anderson’s life and career from small town girl to international sex symbol, actress, activist and doting mother.” “Why can’t we be the heroes of our own life story? Why don’t we just do all the interviews naked?” she jokes at the end of the trailer. “There’s no mystery here.”
