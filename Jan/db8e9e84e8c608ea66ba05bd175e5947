Two police cars were spray-painted with the anti-cop slogan “FTP” on their windshields in Brooklyn early Monday — the fourth attack on NYPD property since late Saturday. The pair of vandalized patrol cars were discovered outside Brooklyn Borough Hall at 209 Joralemon St. around 4:30 a.m. with the letters that stand for “f–k the police” painted on them in red, cops said. There were no arrests, and police were searching for video. A day earlier, at 8:15 p.m. Sunday, an NYPD van was discovered with black lines spray-painted on its back doors in Brooklyn, cops said. The two incidents followed a pair of other vandalism against the NYPD over the weekend. A vandal also was busted for lobbing a bottle at a police van in Harlem late Saturday, and another man was nabbed for trying to light an NYPD vehicle on fire in Midtown hours later. Police claimed that the spray-paint incidents did not appear to be related to local protests over the Tyre Nichols police-brutality slaying in Memphis. “At this time, they appear to be isolated incidents that do not appear to be related to protests,” a police spokeswoman said without elaborating. The bottle-tossing in Harlem, in front of the Apollo Theater on West 125th Street, also isn’t considered protest-related, cops said. Police have said that suspect was arrested about 40 previous times and has a history of fighting with cops and criminal mischief. It was unclear if the incident at the Midtown South Precinct station on West 35th Street was protest-related since the suspect didn’t say anything, cops said. But a criminal-justice expert told The Post on Monday that all of the attacks are little too coincidental. “We saw the same behavior that happened during the George Floyd riots, where we actually had lawyers firebombing cars,” said John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD sergeant. “This is the playbook that [agitators] are going to use. … I don’t know how you can say that it’s not related.”
