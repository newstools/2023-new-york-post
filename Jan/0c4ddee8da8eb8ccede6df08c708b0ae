Having a nice thing is good. But having the best version of that thing? Frankly, it’s incomparable. This holds true for just about anything. An example: box seats at a basketball game are good. You’ll have a nice time. Court-side seats at the NBA finals are better, and you’ll remember that experience for the rest of your life. An aisle seat within the first 10 rows of an airplane is good, but a first class seat where they serve you champagne is better. Similarly, a well-prepared sandwich might get you through the day. Later, you might recommend the deli to friends, and encourage them to try the sandwiches. The best sandwich ever, however, will change your life. You’ll never be the same after you eat the best sandwich ever. It’s a watershed moment in your life. Our question is: with the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro on the market, why would you want any other air fryer? That’s like passing up the best sandwich ever (which you’ll recall, is life-changing) for merely a good sandwich.
