Busy Philipps is done tripping over the past. The 43-year-old actress posted home security footage of a terrifying fall to her Instagram on New Year’s Eve, hoping to leave the humiliating moment behind her. “2022 you broke my f–king heart in multiple ways, but at least you didn’t kill me. Here’s to 2023,” she captioned the video, also clarifying that she was indeed sober. In the mishap, which took place in October, the “White Chicks” alum walks out of her New York City home with her leashed dog, Gina. Suddenly, the “Dawson’s Creek” star dives head-first down the short staircase — her legs go over her head before she finally hits the pavement. “Miraculously,” as Philipps noted, she quickly springs up unscathed, adjusts her hair and reaches for her cellular device to text her ex-husband, Marc Silverstein, who was inside with their kids. The video evidence comes after Philipps detailed the head-over-heels moment on her podcast in an October episode titled, “Busy Almost Died!” At the time, she likened her fall to the meme of a fake Jason Derulo in mid-air on the Met Gala steps. “That is literally in my head what was happening. I was flying … when I landed on the sidewalk, I was like looking up at the trees, and I was like, ‘How am I not dead?'” Philipps explained. She also admitted she’s glad the incident ended the way it did — because dying like that would’ve been lame. “I’m not gonna f—ing die falling down stairs, I can’t. What a bummer. It’s not for me,” she added.
