There is good news, of a sort, for nervous Manhattan office landlords: Leasing for 2022 totaled 23.21 million square feet, up 14% over the year before, according to CBRE. But how couldn’t it be, given the pandemic freeze of 2021? The bad news: most fourth-quarter data stunk. Availability was slightly higher at 19.2% than in the previous quarter, and 1.54 million more square feet were leased than vacated — “negative absorption” — CBRE said. That’s ominous, because fourth quarters often show better results as tenants and landlords scramble to finish deals. The Manhattan market “was impacted during the last quarter by tenants’ hesitancy to make long-term decisions in light of an expected national economic slowdown,” said Michael Slattery, CBRE’s Associate Field Research Director. At least, he noted “year-to-date leasing activity was healthier than in 2021 when the pandemic was in full swing.” Fourth-quarter availability was slightly less than the 19.6% recorded in both February and November of last year. Other highlights from CBRE: Downtown was the only market with positive net absorption in the fourth quarter. The net increase of 566,000 square feet brought the FiDi area’s year-end total to 466,000 square feet. Other brokerages came up with different figures, although they indicate the same mostly negative trends. (The data differ because firms count different building samples). Newmark cited total 2022 leasing of 32.9 million sf, up 15% over 2021. Colliers claimed 4Q leasing fell by 46.5% year over year to 4.94 million sf, reflecting the “sharpest quarterly drop in demand since Q2 2020.”
