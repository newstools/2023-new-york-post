Action Network NFL analyst C Jackson Cowart is in his first season in The Post’s Bettor’s Guide. Here are his best bets for the wild-card round. I’m less bullish on this bet than I am with the Jaguars one below, but only because of the price. I’d be stunned if San Francisco messes around against a team it knows well. The 49ers easily dispatched the Seahawks in these teams’ first two matchups, and they won 10 straight to end the season by an average of 16 points per game — on par with the biggest scoring margins in NFL history if stretched across a full season. San Francisco boasts the best defense and most talent-rich offense in the league, which should be enough to score another convincing win at home. This is the easiest bet to make all weekend, and I’m surprised the line hasn’t moved further in the Jaguars’ favor after some action early in the week. Jacksonville profiled as the better team by virtually every metric over the last 18 weeks, and it clearly looked like the superior side in a 38-10 road win over the Chargers in Week 3, too. Whatever talent gap the betting market sees between these two teams is also mitigated by the myriad injuries for the Chargers, who have to travel cross-country on short rest for Saturday’s nightcap. I smell an outright upset here. Last week: 2-0. Falcons (W), Steelers (W)Season: 18-15-1.
