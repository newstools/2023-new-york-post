Meet “Salmon-Ella.” A woman was given the unflattering name after she went viral for posting a TikTok of her eating a raw piece of salmon while on a bus. The TikTok — which was posted Wednesday — has been viewed almost 2 million times. “Just missing the soya sauce,” said the TikToker in the video’s caption. “Anyone else or am I a wrongen,” read the in-video text. In the video, aggiedayx can be been ripping off the container’s packaging before chowing down. The 26-second video caused several viewers to flop like fishes with incredulity. “I’m begging you pls buy worm tablets TODAY,” commented one user. “Bruh I’m all for raw salmon but you cant be having this kind,” said another concerned user. “Babes buy a pack of smoked salmon like the ready-to-eat slice,” a third person chimed in. “The salmon you get for sushi is specifically treated for parasites so it’s safe,” a fourth person commented. “You shouldn’t just eat any random cut of salmon they will be filled.”
