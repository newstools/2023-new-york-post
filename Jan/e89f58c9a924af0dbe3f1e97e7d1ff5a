More than three in 10 (35%) adults admit they still have at least one bill on their parents’ tab. According to a new poll of 2,000 Americans, the top three expenses still paid by parents are rent (19%), groceries (19%) and utilities (16%). In fact, almost one-quarter (24%) of millennials polled say their parents cover their rent. About three-quarters of those respondents (72%) plan to take on these bills themselves within the next two years, but 30% admit they will be riding the wave until they’re told otherwise. Another 31% are trying to save money, saying it is cheaper to stay on their parent’s plan. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Chartway Credit Union, the survey showed that despite not managing all of their expenses, 85% of respondents consider themselves to be financially responsible. Most respondents (65%) consider having a good credit score to be an indicator of financial responsibility but others weigh lack of debt (64%) and the amount they have in their savings (60%). In an average month, respondents have six different bills and expenses. Things like utilities (56%), food (66%), auto insurance (48%), internet (46%) and rent (43%) or a mortgage (40%) add up fast. Almost three-quarters (73%) of respondents opened their first bank account by their 25th birthday, and 21% opened it before they turned 18. Even though they may not have had a bank account, 30% of respondents started having their own money to spend by the time they were 15. Respondents earned their first spending money through an allowance from their parents (58%) and picking up odd jobs around the neighborhood (56%). Almost seven in 10 (69%) of respondents in the Northeast earned money by helping neighbors, compared to only 43% in the Southeast, fewer than any other region. “How to spend and save responsibly are lifelong lessons,” Brian T. Schools, President/CEO of Chartway Credit Union, said. “It’s noteworthy to see that over three-quarters of those surveyed have been managing their own money for most of their lives. Still, a third of respondents find it difficult to find helpful resources to manage their finances.” Today, half of respondents struggle to limit unnecessary spending. They also face difficulty budgeting for unexpected expenses (45%) and remembering to pay bills on time (40%). On the flip side, only 32% of respondents struggle with their taxes and to keep their credit score high (26%). Almost two in five (39%) millennial respondents struggle to find resources or information for help with their finances, compared to only 11% of baby boomers, fewer than any other generation. “While 85% of respondents see themselves as financially responsible when it comes to things like credit scores or savings, ironically, 50% of them struggle with unnecessary spending or unbudgeted expenses, and 40% struggle to remember to pay bills on time,” Schools observed. “Conflicting data such as this tells us that a lot more adults could benefit from some form of financial education, whether it’s provided in schools, online, or by their financial institutions.”
