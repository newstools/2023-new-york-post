What are the odds! Florida man Stephen Munoz Espinoza struck gold, winning $1 million on a lottery ticket after a rude stranger cut in front of him at a Florida grocery store. Munoz Espinoza, exhausted following a day of work, was looking to buy a lottery ticket when he was cut in line at the ticket machine. The 43-year-old, avoiding a confrontation with his fellow lottery hopeful, opted to buy his ticket at a counter inside Publix Super Market in Delray Beach, Fla. “It was the end of a long day, and I was tired,” Espinoza said. Munoz Espinoza purchased his $50 ticket for a “500X The Cash” game — which has a top prize of $25 million.  He chose the one-time, lump-sum payday which totaled $828,000. “I can’t believe I won a million dollars!” Espinoza said. Espinoza got in his car and made the drive to the Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee, where he claimed his prize and realized it was all true. As for what Munoz Espinoza plans to do with his newfound fortune, he hopes to use the funds to invest in a house for his family.
