The Transportation Security Administration says that a traveler attempted to bring an “emotional support pet” boa constrictor snake through security. A spokesperson for the agency tweeted that the incident happened at Tampa International Airport in December when a woman had the snake, named “Bartholomew,” in her carry-on bag. The snake was detected when the bag went through an x-ray machine. The spokesperson said that TSA contacted the airline, which said that she couldn’t bring the snake aboard the aircraft. According to the agency, the snake is four feet in length. “There’s a danger noodle in that bag… Our officers at Tampa International Airport didn’t find this hyssssssterical! Coiled up in a passenger’s carry-on was a 4’ boa constrictor! We really have no adder-ation for discovering any pet going through an x-ray machine,” the TSA said in an Instagram post.
