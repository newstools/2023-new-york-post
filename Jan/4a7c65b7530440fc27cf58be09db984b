New York finance types might be moving to Florida to avoid income taxes, but at least one broker to the stars is bucking that trend. We hear that Compass’s Carl Gambino has flipped his Sunset Islands home in Florida and moved to New York. The New York-born digs dealer, who spent a decade in LA building his business before moving to Miami, will be going back and forth between the Big Apple, LA, Miami and the Hamptons. Gambino is currently co-listing actor Mark Wahlberg’s Beverly Hills mansion for the “slashed” price of $79.5 million, down from its $87.5 million ask in April. Gambino bought this Miami Beach home at 2300 Lake Ave. for $2.82 million in January 2021. He then flipped it for $5.7 million earlier this month. (It first hit the market for $7.45 million this past October.) The four-bedroom, three-bath home is 3,015 square feet. The midcentury-modern home was gut-renovated in 2018 and later revamped again by Gambino’s wife, celebrity interior designer Sarah Ivory, whose work for Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner was featured in Architectural Digest. The Lake Avenue home also comes with a saltwater pool and outdoor entertaining spaces. The smart-wired property features a chef’s kitchen, marble floors to keep cool in hot weather — and glass doors wrapped around the exterior to showcase views of the pool, lawns and wood decks. Gambino, who had the listing, declined comment. Vision Realty of Miami’s William Zayas repped the buyer. We hear that Gambino, Ivory and their two kids, ages 2 and 5, have moved into a townhouse rental in Greenwich Village — for now.
