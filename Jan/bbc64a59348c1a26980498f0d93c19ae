Stoke the fire and get out the fuzzy socks because winter is really here. High-quality cold-weather clothes will keep you nice and warm through a long snowy winter, but some of it is bulky and uncomfortable. Try fighting the elements in the Be Warm Heated Vest instead. This self-heating vest plugs into a power bank and delivers soothing heat all over, and it’s only $49.99 (reg. $149). Rain or snow, the Be Warm is a smart investment for the winter. Plug in a power bank and enjoy gentle heat coming from seven heat zones on the front, back, and neck of your vest. Switch between low, medium, and high temperature with the press of a button located on the upper chest. Even the pockets are heated. No more sore hands after playing in the snow. Don’t worry about a little water or snow hurting your vest, either. It’s totally waterproof. The heating lasts as long as your power bank is charged. Just connect your power bank to the USB plug and enjoy. Bring a portable generator camping, and you could plug your vest in and enjoy a full night of comfort. You might end up doing a lot more winter adventuring this season now that you can make sure you’ll stay warm while you’re out. Luckily, Be Warm is machine-washable. Just make sure you remove the power bank, first. You can hand-wash, or you could just throw it in the washer and dryer on low settings. If you’re getting ready for a cold winter, you may want some gear that doesn’t rely on your body heat to keep you warm.
