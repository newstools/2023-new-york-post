It’s “Stephen A. Shaq.” “NBA on TNT” Tuesdays are back with Shaquille O’Neal, Adam Lefkoe, Candace Parker and the newest member of their crew, former NBA player Jamal Crawford. And the show debuted with Shaq showing off a hilarious hair makeover inspired by Stephen A. Smith. O’Neal had his co-hosts cracking up during the pregame show prior to the Thunder-Heat game when he showed off a fresh lineup that was similar to Smith’s ‘do. But first, he stopped by NBA TV with Kristen Ledlow and Channing Frye. “I’ve been told though that our Hall of Famer, Shaquille O’Neal, is not available, but instead, Stephen A. Shaq is on the line,” Ledlow said. “Zoom in, that boy looking good ain’t he,” Shaq said, laughing, as he strut onto the set. “To my right, a four-time champion, Stephen A. Shaq,” Adam Lefkoe introduced the NBA legend. “You know, we had plans but when that hair line walks (in) it’s something we gotta discuss.” Shaq said, “Shout out to my main man, Stephen A.” When Parker questioned whether his haircut was crooked, Shaq laughed while TNT cameras zoomed in for closer inspection. “Oh, it is crooked,” Shaq said, laughing. Lefkoe agreed before Shaq seemingly called out his barber. “Bill, I’ma kill you when I get home Bill,” he said. Smith has yet to address Shaq’s shoutout.
