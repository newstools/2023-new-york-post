Heavy metal band Pantera has had three shows canceled from their forthcoming reunion tour following controversy over a 2016 incident involving singer Phil Anselmo. The shows were dropped from the line-ups of Germany’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals earlier this week, as well as a show in Vienna, due to public backlash over a seemingly racist gesture Anselmo made six years ago. The frontman reportedly made a Nazi salute and shouted “white power” at a concert, an act that has now cost the band several highly anticipated tour dates following a 20-year hiatus. The promoter of the festivals cited public backlash as the reason for dropping the band, saying the decision was made due to “intensive conversations with artists, our partners and you, the festival fans”. The promoter for the Austrian show did not provide a clear reason for the cancelation, writing only that refunds would be available for ticket holders. Anselmo commented on the 2016 incident following widespread backlash from the music community. “Philip H Anselmo here, and I’m here to basically respond to all the heat I’ve been getting that I deserve completely,” he said on a YouTube video published by Housecore Records. “I was at the Dimebash, and it was extremely late at night. There was heavy-duty talk between myself and those who love Dime. And heavy emotions were flowing, jokes were made backstage that transpired upon the stage, and it was ugly. “It was uncalled for. And anyone who knows me and my true nature knows that I don’t believe in any of that; I don’t want to be part of any group. I’m an individual, and I am a thousand percent apologetic to anyone that took offense to what I said because you should have taken offense to what I said. “And I am so sorry, and I hope you just … man, give me another chance to … just give me another chance. I love all of you. And anyone who’s met me, anyone who knows me knows that I love all of you. Bless you.”
