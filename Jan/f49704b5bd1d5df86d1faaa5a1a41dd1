Almost three weeks after Mets owner Steve Cohen announced the agreement, Carlos Correa is now returning to the Twins. Minnesota agreed to a six-year, $200 million deal with Correa on Tuesday after Correa’s right ankle became an issue for the Mets. Now that Correa’s deal with the Mets has fizzled, the team will have limited options this late in the offseason to potentially upgrade the lineup. A few possibilities: He’s coming off two straight injury-shortened seasons, but the former All-Star third baseman was signed by general manager Billy Eppler with the Angels and might not cost the Mets much in terms of prospects given that he’s still owed $140 million over the next four years. Rendon underwent wrist surgery in June, but returned for the final week of the regular season. The Pirates outfielder has been among the game’s most discussed trade candidates this offseason following his request to be dealt. Acquiring Reynolds would allow the Mets to utilize Mark Canha as a fourth outfielder and DH option, squeezing out Darin Ruf. Last season Reynolds posted an .807 OPS. He still has three seasons until free agency. Want to catch a game? The Mets schedule with links to buy tickets can be found here.  The free-agent would be a DH option, but the 38-year-old is coming off an alarming drop-off season with the Astros in which he produced a .647 OPS. Eduardo Escobar rebounded strong over the final month last season after a sluggish stretch to begin his Mets career and Brett Baty now becomes the organization’s future at third base. But Escobar, in concert with the rookie Baty, might be enough to solidify the Mets that another acquisition isn’t needed. The Mets were initially headed in this direction until reversing course toward Correa last month.
