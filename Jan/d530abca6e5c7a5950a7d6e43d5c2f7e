More like 20,000 screams under the sea. Footage of a bizarre, ocean-dwelling wolffish that has two sets of scary-looking teeth is making waves online. The clip of the deep sea denizen’s nightmarish visage was posted earlier this month by Roman Fedortsov, a Russian trawlerman stationed off Murmansk, who photographs nightmarish critters he’s accidentally snared while trying to hook fish. Some of this alien bycatch, which Fedortsov uploads to his more than 642,000 followers, has included bearded sea dragons and a marine monster with a Kim Kardashian-esque “trout pout.” The angler’s latest unintended haul reportedly entailed an oceanic predator called a spotted wolffish, which lives at the bottom of the North Atlantic and parts of the Arctic oceans. As captured on video, it boasts googly walleyes and two rows of undulating snaggle-teeth like an undersea clown from the horror movie “It.” At one point, the camera zooms into the monster’s maw, giving viewer’s a prey’s-eye view of the impressive dentistry. The iron maiden-mouthed critter made quite the splash on Instagram, with one commenter shuddering: “Yeah, no … it’s a no for me.” “Dude needs to brush,” quipped another, while one viewer exclaimed, “Good grief … the teeth have teeth!!!!” Indeed, the wolffish, which can grow over 5 feet long, is equipped with two rows of chompers. It uses these jawsome mandibles to crunch hard-shelled prey such as sea urchins, sea stars, various mollusks and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Speaking of dentally-endowed dwellers, Fedortsov shared pics in July of a deep-sea crab that sported human-like teeth as if wearing old-time dentures. He also went viral in May with footage of a fish shaped like a pair of testicles.
