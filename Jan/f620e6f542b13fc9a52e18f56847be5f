A24 is relishing their big moment. The entertainment company is on a roll after “Everything Everywhere All at Once” dominated the 2023 Oscars with 11 nominations — more than any other film this year. But hot dog brand Oscar Mayer missed out on their big shot when they failed to respond to a direct message about the film. In February 2022, A24 actually reached out to Oscar Mayer about a potential collaboration in the film’s most iconic scene. “We have an upcoming film that happens to heavily feature hot dogs. If you’re open to it, we’d love to discuss a fun collaborative project we have in mind — can’t thank of a better partner for this!” the DM read. The then-upcoming film happened to be “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” starring Michelle Yeoh, 60, as a Chinese-American immigrant who is swept into parallel universes in order to save all of existence — including a universe where she has hot dog fingers with co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, 64. Oscar Mayer might have made the wurst decision by not responding to the pitch — but A24 had no reason to sweat. Instead, another Oscar prevailed: the 2023 Oscars. The hit film scored 11 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and two Best Supporting Actress nods. A24 posted the unanswered DM to social media after the nominations were announced Tuesday, captioning it, “When one Oscar lets you down, another comes through.” Oscar Mayer took the loss and responded on Instagram — almost a year later. “The L is on us. Congrats to @a24 for #KeepingItOscar. Sending you buns of love,” the company captioned a picture of hands made out of hot dogs with the fingers in the shape of an “L.” Frankly, Oscar Mayer will be taking an even bigger “L” if “Everything Everywhere All at Once” becomes an Oscar wiener.
