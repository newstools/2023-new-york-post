CJ Harris, a former “American Idol” semifinalist who appeared on Season 13, has died suddenly at 31. The pop star had reportedly had a heart attack in his hometown of Jasper, Alabama, on Sunday, sources told TMZ. He was subsequently rushed to the hospital, but perished shortly thereafter. Harris had memorably auditioned for the Fox talent show in 2014, bringing the house down with an electrifying performance of the Allman Brothers Band’s hit “Soulshine.” Judge Keith Urban told the aspiring vocalist: “You sing because you have to sing, not ’cause you want to sing. “And I mean that in the deepest way,” the country star added. “And that’s why it’s so believable and real.” The singer also performed other hit covers on the show, including “Too Close,” “American Woman” and “Free Fallin.’ ” Harris was selected as a wild card in the semifinals after not receiving enough votes. He made it all the way to the Top 6 before getting eliminated. Harris saw success after his “Idol” stint, notably performing at the Grand Ole Opry with Darius Rucker, whom he credited for influencing his style. Harris isn’t the only notable “Idol” alum to pass away of late. In October, “American Idol” runner-up Willie Spence reportedly died due to injuries from a car accident. He was 23.
