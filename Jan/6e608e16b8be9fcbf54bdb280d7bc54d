You are a Giants fan, and so there are two things you know as well as any fan of any team in any sport, certainly as well as any team that performs its services within the boundaries of Greater New York: 1. These opportunities don’t come along every year, so it’s best to seize them when you can, 2. It actually is possible to seize those moments, to take advantage of those opportunities, to maximize your participation in ways even you, the truest of true believers, don’t fully appreciate until it happens. You are a Giants fan, so you know winning one game in the playoffs — as innocent as that may seem in real time, as irrelevant as it may feel in the moment, inside the bigger picture — can sometimes really be the first domino, with others to follow, others to fall. You can bear witness to that. You can testify. You have seen it. You have done it. You are a Giants fan, and so you have probably spent the first 19 weeks of this football season not sure whether you want to canonize Brian Daboll or merely adopt him, but you certainly understand it when he tries to pump the brakes ever so gently of what suddenly feels, a few days shy of game night in Philadelphia, like a percolating monsoon of momentum. “You work really hard to get to this point,” Daboll said Tuesday afternoon, as work began in earnest for Daboll and his charges for what promises to be perhaps the most hotly anticipated game of the second weekend of the postseason, Lincoln Financial Field, Saturday, 8:15 p.m. “But I think you have to focus on keeping the main thing the main thing. It was good to move on, but you’ve got to put that in the past really quick and get to the preparation on this week’s opponent. Number-one seed. They won the [NFC] East. They beat us twice. They got eight Pro Bowlers, six All-Pros. I think they can get your attention real quick, so we got a lot of work to do.” Sure. You are a Giants fan, and you get that. You understand that. You are, in fact, grateful to see that Daboll is treating this week’s showdown with the Eagles the way he would any other game, which is to say: complete and comprehensive calm. And focus. The Giants have lost a few games this year but it wasn’t for lack of purpose and preparation. That’s what Daboll does. It’s what he’s done. That’s his job. And make no mistake: he understands and appreciates your job. “Look, we appreciate our fan base,” he said. “They’ve been great all year. They’re part of our team. And they’ve been a help all year. They were loud in Minnesota. That was a hostile place, and we just wanted to go out there and do a good job for them.” You are a Giants fan, and so you know, maybe better than anyone, what can happen when everyone feels a part of something like this: players, coaches, hardcore fans, bandwagon fans, everyone. You’ve seen it. You’ve done it. You were there in January 2008 when things began innocently enough with a road win at Tampa, Eli Manning earning his first career postseason win. You were there four years later, January 2012, when the Giants began another magnificent journey by holding serve at home against the Falcons — still the only postseason game ever held at MetLife Stadium. And you saw what happened in both years after that, the way the rock rolling down the hill slowly became a cluster of rocks and then a boulder, the belief of the players and the faith of the fans melding the deeper things went, a merry, marvelous tour of Dallas, Green Bay and Glendale, Ariz., the first time; a giddy and gratifying march through Green Bay, San Francisco and Indianapolis the second. You are a Giants fan, so you know better than to allow these thoughts cramming your heart and your brain to slip through to your tongue, because you know the football gods are always paying attention. A part of you understands that even if the season ends in Philly, it will have been a wonder, something to treasure. And that will be fine. Still. You know something else is out there. You are a Giants fan; you know that better than anyone that something else is out there. You’ve seen this before. You’ve done this before.
