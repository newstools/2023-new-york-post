Hillary Clinton has got a new gig. The former secretary of state and presidential candidate will join Manhattan’s Columbia University as a professor focusing on global affairs, the school announced Thursday. She will serve both as a professor of practice at the School of International and Public Affairs and as a presidential fellow at Columbia World Projects, university president Lee Bollinger said in a message to the school community. “Given her extraordinary talents and capacities together with her singular life experiences, Hillary Clinton is unique, and, most importantly, exceptional in what she can bring to the University’s missions of research and teaching, along with public service and engagement for the public good,” Bollinger said. He added that he has known Clinton personally for three decades. Clinton will begin teaching students in the 2023-2024 academic year. In a statement, the former first lady said she was honored to join the educational institution and excited to join in “Columbia’s commitment to educating the next generation of US and global policy leaders.” In her role at Columbia World Project, Clinton will advise efforts to engage women and young people across the country. “We look forward to welcoming this extraordinarily accomplished global leader and passionate advocate for women, children, and social justice to Columbia World Projects,” director of the initiative Wafaa El-Sadr said.
