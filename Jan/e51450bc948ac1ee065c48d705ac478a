Christian McCaffrey is expressing gratitude for girlfriend Olivia Culpo as he readies for his first playoff run as a member of the 49ers. In a post shared Tuesday on his Instagram Story, McCaffrey — who was traded to San Francisco by the Carolina Panthers in October — gushed over Culpo, 30, for being there “through it all.” “I love you,” McCaffrey, 26, wrote alongside a snap of the couple hugging. Culpo, who has been dating McCaffrey since 2019, celebrated the former first-round pick earlier in the day Tuesday, when she shared a touching tribute to the 49ers playmaker on her own Instagram page. “WHAT A YEAR ! So proud of you @christianmccaffrey. You deserve this and beyond,” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model wrote, “next up, playoffs!” McCaffrey spent the first five-and-a-half seasons of his career with the Panthers and only previously reached the playoffs in his 2017 rookie year. McCaffrey said the 49ers are “fired up” as wild-card weekend approaches. “I think guys are excited, we’re obviously fired up, real ball play is now,” McCaffrey said following San Francisco’s blowout win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, per Fox 40 Sports in Sacramento. When the 49ers host their NFC West rival Seahawks on Saturday in the opening round of the playoffs, expect Culpo to be in the stands at Levi’s Stadium. The “Culpo Sisters” star has cheered on the running back throughout the season, including the 49ers’ win over the Raiders on New Year’s Day. “Here’s to ‘23 w #23!!!!” Culpo said of McCaffrey, who wears No. 23. Through 11 regular-season games with the 49ers, McCaffrey has rushed for 746 yards and six touchdowns. He has also recorded 52 receptions for 464 yards and four touchdowns.
