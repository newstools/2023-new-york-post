The toy industry is apparently booming right now. As it turns out, the parents, along with so-called “kidults,” are doing all the toy shopping sprees because they want the toys for themselves. A restored penchant for cartoons, superheroes, and collectibles has apparently sparked this new retail habit, leading to toy companies making products that would cater to both kids and kids-at-heart alike. Even better, the ToyBox 3D Printer Deluxe Bundle lets you design and print your very own toys, and now through January 30, you can get it on sale for 36% off — no coupon needed! An easy-to-use 3D printer, the ToyBox encourages both kids and adults to get creative and conceptualize their own toys. You also have the option to select from the ever-growing toy catalog if you don’t feel like making your own. With the simple one-touch functions, you’ll find the design and printing process straightforward, and the companion app makes it easy to visualize your dream toys. Check out how it works: Feeling nostalgic? Thanks to ToyBox’s partnership with Warner Bros, you can print toys based on characters found in DC Comics, Cartoon Network, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Friends, Seinfeld, and even classic films like Polar Express and Elf. Feel free to print toys inspired by Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and so much more. With a purchase, you’ll get not just the printer, but also eight colors of non-toxic, biodegradable printer food that can be used for making around 100 to 300 toys. That’ll keep you busy for months on end. Formerly retailing for $469, you can get the ToyBox 3D Printer Deluxe Bundle on sale for only $299.99 until January 30. Prices subject to change.
