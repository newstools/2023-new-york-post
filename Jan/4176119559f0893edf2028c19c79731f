Three people were killed – including two teenage BMW passengers – in separate crashes in the Big Apple on Sunday, authorities said. One of the young victims, Ronish Kush, 16, was ejected from a speeding 2011 BMW around 10:45 p.m. Sunday when the driver lost control, slammed into a median and flipped over on the Belt Parkway near Farmers Boulevard in Springfield Gardens, Queens, cops said. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Another passenger, Sukhmani Singh, 18, was rushed to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he, too, was pronounced dead. The driver, 19, was taken to the same hospital in stable condition. Preliminarily, investigators believe that speed was a factor in the deadly crash. About 15 minutes earlier in Manhattan, Nathaniel Knight, 40, was riding an electric motorcycle when he was fatally struck on the FDR Drive near East 55th Street, cops said. Knight of Brooklyn was heading uptown on the highway when two 19-year-old Honda Civic drivers appeared to be racing behind him, police said. One of the Honda drivers tried to brake to avoid hitting Knight but ended up getting rear-ended by the other motorist, propelling him into the motorcycle, cops said. Knight became pinned under one of the Hondas and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Both teen drivers stayed at the scene and were not hurt. No charges were immediately filed.
