This disastrous proposal video is bringing people to their knees. A viral TikTok showing an engagement gone wrong has many both cringing and laughing thanks to an “oblivious” tourist butting into the romantic moment. The TikTok, which was posted on Tuesday and has gained 358,000 views, shows Jordan McGowan and her now-fiancé Sean Munn in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he gets down on one knee to propose. “Watch this woman ruins my proposal video,” she wrote in text over the video. Captured on camera, the female tourist ignores the sweet moment and steps over Munn’s leg to snap a pic of the scenic waterfall, despite the obvious wedding proposal taking place. Thankfully, the now-engaged couple took it in stride. “Honestly I find it funny,” McGowan wrote along with the video. “No harm done its a laugh to watch.” The soon-to-be-bride also took to Instagram to show off her engagement ring and joke about the “lovely woman ruining my video.” “That woman wasn’t stopping for the shot,” one commenter wrote, to which McGowan responded, “No she was not.” While McGowan got a good laugh, some commenters disagreed with her sentiments and shamed the tourist for wrecking the moment. “She knew exactly what was happening and she did it on purpose,” wrote one user. “The way she STEPS over his foot,” commented a second person. “I see the funny side,” added another, “but it’s quite concerning how completely oblivious some people are to their surroundings.” McGowan also said she was unsure how the tourist didn’t see it happening in the first place. “I know,” she wrote, “absolutely crazy how you would miss us.”
