Adrenaline junkies will feel right at home here. This uniquely horrifying short-term rental invites thrill-seekers to spend the night — while suspended 1,300 feet above ground. For $450 a night, Urubamba, Peru’s Skylodge Adventure Suites promises to give visitors a memorable stay in a see-through “luxury capsule” slung off the top of a mountain in the nation’s Sacred Valley. The Suites give “the chance to sleep within a completely transparent hanging bedroom, that allows you to appreciate the impressive view of this magic and mystic valley,” according to the lodging’s Airbnb profile. To access the pods, guests must climb over 1,300 feet of a “via ferrata” (also known as a protected climbing route) or “hike an intrepid trail through ziplines.” (Guests, the Suites’ website notes, must weigh 265 pounds or below to ascend safely.) Once there, packages include not just sleep accommodations — but also breakfast, “gourmet dinner with wine,” transportation from Cusco and assistance from bilingual guides. In all, the experience is intended to reconnect guests “with nature or make them realize what really luxury can be,” the Suites’ manager, Natalia Rodriguez, told CNN Travel. The aerospace aluminum and weather-resistant polycarbonate pods, she noted, were particularly challenging to construct due to the need to transport the materials up the mountain, as well as the necessity of making them capable of handling intense winds. In all, there are three pods — with a maximum Skylodge capacity of 12 people per night. Each pod is equipped with its own bed, bathroom and dining area. Meanwhile, in the United Arab Emirates, a similarly sensational hotel concept may soon also exist in the Sharjah mountains. Called the Floating Retreat, that resort would also offer a levitating, see-through hotel to guests who aren’t faint of heart.
