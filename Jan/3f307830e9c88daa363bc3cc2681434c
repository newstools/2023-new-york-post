You’d be working on your “night cheese.” A new study looks to prove that eating cheese before bed can cause nightmares. The study — undertaken by Sleep Junkie — is looking for five American testers to slice their way through several types of cheeses every week, asking the participants to record their dreams and nightmares. Sleep Junkie is sweetening the deal by giving their “dairy dreamers” $1,000 upon completion of the study. “The chosen candidates will be paid for their work and all cheese costs will be expensed,” reads the official job description. “Our dairy dreamers will become our official cheese testers, providing honest feedback on how eating various kinds of cheese before bed impacts their sleep quality.” According to the website, applicants must be over 21, own a smartwatch or fitness tracker, sleep alone, have a consistent sleep schedule, not suffer from any sleep-related issues and — probably most important — not be dairy- or lactose-intolerant. The study is expected to take place between March and May. Sleep Junkie is calling for “self-starters, honest, with good writing skills and [who] enjoy both sleeping and eating” to apply for the study.
