At a White House ceremony honoring the Golden State Warriors, 80-year-old President Biden got down on one knee for a photo-op with the championship team, but Vice President Kamala Harris refused to bend the knee, saying “I’m not doing that.” After the Warriors assembled for the photo on Tuesday, Biden and Harris stood in front of the team, which has won four championships in eight years, and appeared to discuss where they would pose. “I’ll tell you what,” Biden said to Harris before bending down on his right knee, making a thumbs up gesture. The vice president laughed and said, “I’m not doing that,” before taking a spot between players Steph Curry and Andre Iguodala. After the shot, Biden stood up and moved into a crouching stance as the team let out a cheer. During the ceremony, as Biden welcomed the team to the White House, he apparently bumbled the pronunciation of the vice president’s name. “As Kamala said, we’re all closely monitoring the storms, the floods, the landslides all across California,” Biden said, saying his second-in-command’s name like “CAM-a-la” rather than the proper “COMMA-la.” Curry, who was named MVP after the Warriors beat the Boston Celtics in six games to win the 2022 NBA championship, presented Biden and Harris with team jerseys and joked that he’d like to return to see them hanging in the Oval Office. “We have two jerseys — a number 46 and a number 49 — that we would love to have you a part of Dub Nation forever,” he said to laughter. “And maybe find on the wall in the Oval Office or in your office.” “That would be — we’ll come back — hopefully, we’ll be able to come back and check and see if it’s up there,” Curry said.
