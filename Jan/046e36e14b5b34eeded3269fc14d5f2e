Jimmy Garoppolo isn’t counting himself out just yet. On Friday, the injured San Francisco 49ers quarterback told The Athletic “that’s still up in the air,” regarding a return for the Super Bowl if San Francisco beats the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in the NFC Championship. After taking over for Trey Lance following his season-ending right ankle injury in Week 2, Garoppolo, 31, fractured his left foot in Week 13 against the Miami Dolphins. Last week, he returned to practice for rehab work, but he’s not yet ready to return this week to face the Eagles. Garoppolo explained he “can do everything on his still-mending foot but sprint.” Since Garoppolo’s absence, “Mr. Irrelevant” Brock Purdy has kept the 49ers relevant. He’s recorded a 7-0 record since taking over, and has recorded a 109.9 quarterback rating with three touchdowns, and zero interceptions in the playoffs. Garoppolo has not been placed on injured reserve, giving the 49ers the option to bring the quarterback into action before the season concludes. Currently, Josh Johnson, who joined the team following Garoppolo’s injury, is the No. 2 quarterback if needed. Prior to his injury, Garoppolo completed 67.2 percent of his passes for 2,437 yards with 16 touchdowns and four interceptions. Given Purdy’s performance, however, if he can beat the Eagles and clinch the NFC Championship, it may not matter if Garoppolo is available or not. Garoppolo will become a free agent in March and could be a solution to another NFL team’s quarterback needs.
