Thoughts and prayers from Hollywood and beyond poured out for Jeremy Renner on Monday after the “Hawkeye” star was critically injured in a freak snowplow accident. “My heart is with @JeremyRenner,” director James Gunn — who helms Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise — posted Monday afternoon on Twitter. The 51-year-old Marvel Universe star was injured Sunday when a large snowplow he was using at his northern Nevada property reportedly malfunctioned and ran over his leg. He lost a “serious” amount of blood in the incident, and neighbors had to apply a tourniquet before an airlift came to retrieve him, according to reports. Messages wishing him well soon started coming in, including one from “Terminator 2: Judgement Day” actor Robert Patrick. “Sending up thoughts and prayers for @JeremyRenner!” tweeted Patrick, who starred with Renner in the 2014 film “Kill the Messenger.” Another Renner co-star, from his 1995 film debut “National Lampoon’s Senior Trip,” chimed in as well. “My sweet @JeremyRenner. Loved you for decades. From a Senior Trip to the #MCU,” actress Tara Strong tweeted, along with a photo of the two in the movie. “Sending you & your closest healing love, light & strength for a full recovery.” Fans also expressed words of support — and horror at what had happened. “I can’t even imagine that pain,” Twitter user @lowymatt1211 posted, along with a photo of the model of snowplow that ran over Renner’s leg. “The entire MCU galaxy is thinking and praying for him though so hoping a sound recovery can occur,” @lowymatt1211 said. The sentiment was shared by actor Josh Gad. “My God,” Gad tweeted. “Praying for @JeremyRenner and his family.”
