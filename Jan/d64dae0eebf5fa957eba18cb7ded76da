Lube is in the air this Valentine’s season, thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow’s 2023 gift guide. The Goop founder, 50, released Valentine’s Day goodies for lovers looking to create a buzz in the bedroom. The gift guide includes nearly fifty vibrators, sea salt and caramel water-based lube and a 24-karat gold razor for a whopping $425. Goop found ways to disguise kinky sex toys as luxury items. The gift guide includes a gold necklace that’s actually a vibrator — but it isn’t obvious to the naked eye. “It’s a necklace and a vibrator. It’s made of stainless steel, finished in twenty-four-karat gold, and completely waterproof,” the necklace description reads. The discreet sex toy costs $149. Paltrow’s wide selection of vibrators will have customers reaching new climaxes, whether they’re using the Smile Makers Poet Vibrator for $129 or Heartthrob Vibrator for $200. One of the best-selling items is the $75 “This Smells Like My Vagina Candle,” released in 2020. The scent smells like “Citrusy bergamot, geranium and cedar juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed,” the Goop site shares. In January 2022, the company unveiled another vagina scent called the “Hands Off My Vagina,” in honor of the January 22, 1973, anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Goop donated $25 from each $75 candle sale to the ACLU Foundation’s Reproductive Freedom Project. The current gift guide ranges in price from a $12 Moonbeam Essential Oil Blend to $33,870 Dois Irmãos Semi-Set Earrings. The list allows customers to choose a variety of luxury goods based on their price bracket. If you thought the gifts couldn’t get any spicier, Paltrow is bringing dirty thoughts to the dinner table with $88 “Kama Sutra Dinner Napkins,” which are emblazoned with erotic sex positions. Paltrow’s lifestyle brand consistently delivers items for consumers’ sexual pleasure and desires so if you’re looking to get naughty this Valentine’s day — Goop has you covered.
