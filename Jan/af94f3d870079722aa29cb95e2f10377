Shoot for the moon, get lost along the way — and you might end up at this terrestrial moon homage. An otherworldly abode just north of San Diego has hit the market. The one-of-a-kind estate is listed for $19.99 million with the reality TV-famous brother team of Matthew and Joshua Altman, of “Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles.” The thoroughly original retreat in Encinitas is perched upon a 74-foot promontory with panoramic views of the surrounding coastline, giving residents the feeling that they’re “on and in the ocean,” Matthew Altman told The Post. Built in 2003 and featured in the Season 3 premiere of HBO’s hit show “Westworld,” the 6,300-plus-square-foot mansion boasts five bedrooms, six bathrooms and a half moon-shaped outdoor infinity pool. Built by award-winning designer Wallace E. Cunningham, the property itself also has a half moon shape when viewed from above. “I truly don’t look at this house as a house,” said Altman, who previously sold the Cunningham-designed Razor House. “To me, these are two masterpieces. This is a living piece of art.” Set on a double oceanfront lot, the concrete, titanium and glass-heavy home features a tiered design with curved walls keeping a central courtyard private from prying eyes. There are patios, verandas, terraces and decks galore — and central air conditioning throughout. A staircase that “looks like a skeleton” connects the floors. There is indoor-outdoor living opportunity aplenty, two garage spaces and a “spa-like” ensuite bathroom off the primary bedroom. Plenty of light brown cabinets breakup the clean-lined, smooth-surfaced aesthetic in the kitchen and offer a homely touch. Meanwhile, the bedrooms, bathrooms and even closets shown in listing photos maintain the industrial-chic energy of the house, which is both home and an interactive installation piece of sorts.
