A vandal was arrested for throwing a bottle at an NYPD van in Harlem late Saturday night, amid national protests over Tyre Nichols killing in Memphis, cops said. Albert Plummer, 38, allegedly threw a glass bottle at the rear driver’s side window of a marked police van in front of the Apollo Theater at West 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard around 10:40 p.m., according to police. A police officer assigned to the Apollo Theater detail was inside the van, an NYPD spokesman said. The bottle shattered the window, the spokesman said. Plummer, of Harlem, was charged with assault, menacing, criminal mischief and reckless endangerment, cops said. An NYPD spokeswoman said the incident wasn’t part of a protest. “This was not protest related,” the spokeswoman said. “He didn’t make any remarks.” Plummer has been arrested about 40 times and has a history of fighting police officers and criminal mischief, police said. The incident came amid protests over the death of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis cops. Video released late Friday showed the fatal beating delivered by police officers that sparked nationwide outrage.
