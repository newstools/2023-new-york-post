I’m everything I am because you snubbed me! Fans cried foul last weekend when Rolling Stone left Celine Dion off the magazine’s 200 Greatest Singers of All Time list. Announcing the roster on Twitter, the publication was already on the defensive. “Before you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List,” the tweet said. “Talent is impressive; genius is transcendent.” But when the Dion die-hards realized the Canadian chanteuse had not been deemed “transcendent” enough to rate the Top 200, they reacted as though they had just collided with an iceberg, lining up to drag the magazine through the merde. “Rolling Stone needs to immediately exit the business of music journalism,” said Twitter user mtl_vocalist. A furious @elasticdijon added, “The fact that Céline Dion isn’t anywhere in the top 200 is a crime against humanity.” And user @JamieCollabro said, “Respectfully, not including Celine Dion, arguably the best vocal technician of all time, in this list is borderline treasonous.” Dion, 54, ranks among the highest selling solo artists in history, with more than 250 million albums sold. And her two Las Vegas residencies at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, “A New Day” and “Celine,” grossed a combined $681 million. There were other surprises on Rolling Stone’s list. Michael Jackson was ranked at a lowly No. 86, while Kurt Cobain got No. 36. Taylor Swift ranked at 102, well above Barbra Streisand, who snagged spot 147. And, like Dion, Judy Garland and Cher didn’t make the cut at all, yet heavy metal wailer Ozzy Osbourne did. Rolling Stone’s Top 5 picks were: 1. Aretha Franklin, 2. Whitney Houston, 3. Sam Cooke, 4. Billie Holiday and 5. Mariah Carey. Dion was recently forced to cancel her upcoming tour after she revealed she has been diagnosed with a rare incurable disease called stiff-person syndrome, which adversely affects the singer’s ability to walk and sing.
