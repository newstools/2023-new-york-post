Sebastian Bastian, CEO of Bahamian casino company Island Luck, has sold his luxe Miami mansion for $28.2 million. Mansion Global first reported the news. Located on the Venetian Islands, the newly constructed three-story home is made up of five bedrooms and seven baths. Spanning more than 13,400 square feet, Bastian bought the home in 2019 for $7.75 million before its renovation — which means he stood to profit significantly. Developed by Todd Michael Glaser, the three-story home was completed in 2021 and boasts panoramic waterfront views. Features include floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors, a custom marble bar, a movie theater, a fire pit, a summer kitchen and a 10-foot infinity-edge pool. There are also unobstructed views overlooking the Miami skyline. Chad Carroll, Eli Faitelson and Korina Evaniuk with The Carroll Group represented the sellers in the off-market deal, while Jaime Blatt with Inside Network brought the buyer. Home prices in Miami have skyrocketed in the recent years. According to Realtor.com’s latest 2023 forecast, South Florida prices are set to increase 3.4% in 2023. “The 2023 housing market could become a ‘nobody’s-market,’ not friendly to buyers nor to sellers,” Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale wrote.
