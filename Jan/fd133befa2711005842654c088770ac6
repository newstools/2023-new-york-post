Diane Warren scored a touchdown with this song. The songstress revealed Friday that she recruited Dolly Parton, Gloria Estefan, Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Harry and Belinda Carlisle to sing a song — titled “Gonna Be You” for the upcoming film “80 for Brady,” reports Entertainment Weekly. “I wanted to write a song that celebrated these women’s deep friendship,” Warren said in a statement. “Since 80 was in the title I got a crazy idea: Why not get some of the most iconic singers from the ’80s, who are still amazing and always will be, to all sing it?” “Everyone I approached said yes and was just as excited as me,” continued Warren. The film — which is inspired by true events — details a trip undertaken by four best friends — played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field — to attend the 2017 Super Bowl. Other cast members include Billy Porter, Guy Fieri, Ron Gronkowski, and … yes, Tom Brady himself also stars in the film. Actress Jane Fonda revealed that she once got a little starstruck when Brady arrived on set. “My knees actually got weak when he walked into my trailer,” Fonda recalled. “I’m in awe of that kind of skill. When somebody is the best in the world at what they do, you have to honor that and respect it. I was just awestruck.” “He was kind and humble, which is hard to believe considering how brilliant he is at what he does, but it’s true. He was also sweet and polite.” “80 for Brady” is set to hail mary its way into theaters on February 3, 2023.
