An emotionally disturbed Staten Island man was arrested Thursday and charged in the stabbing death of a fired NYPD detective, police sources said. Eric Wilson, 26, who has seven prior arrests, allegedly got into a beef with victim Nicholas Nelson on Wednesday night, which escalated and turned violent — ending with the ex-cop’s death, police and sources said. Sources said the fight started when Wilson allegedly tried to open Nelson’s car door while his son was inside. Nelson, 37, then took his children back to their mom on Elizabeth Street in West Brighton, but Wilson followed and remained outside yelling for the ex-cop to come outside, the sources said. Nelson did and was stabbed in the neck. Sources said Wilson, who lives up the street, is known to cops in the area and has been the subject of calls to police regarding an emotionally disturbed person. Wilson left after the encounter but was later taken in for questioning and ultimately charged with murder, assault and weapons possession around 11 a.m. Thursday, sources said. It is unclear if the two men knew each other, but sources said they had no history of previous fights. Nelson joined the NYPD in 2008 and rose to the rank of detective before his career was derailed due to several disturbing incidents, department records reveal. He was docked 20 vacation days and agreed to go to counseling in 2012 after getting into a fight with a woman with whom he shared a child, the records show. On March 16, 2019, Nelson allegedly assaulted his girlfriend and was brought up on disciplinary charges, ultimately getting suspended and demoted, the records show. It is unclear if the 2019 victim was the same woman involved in the 2012 altercation. He was fired from the force in May 2021 after getting into an off-duty drunken-driving accident in August 2018, court records show.
