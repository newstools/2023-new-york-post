In the spirit of offering up New Year’s resolutions, any avid golfer out there would be thrilled to see 2023 bring the best swings of their life. Of course, that progress requires some practice, which can become particularly tricky with winter weather here. During our “Same You, New Hobby” campaign to celebrate a fresh year, we’re serving up a season-proof solution to help you work on that golf swing. The TruGolf Mini Golf Simulator is currently discounted to only $179 (reg. $249) with no coupon required through January 9. A proven commodity for those aiming to increase consistency on the course, TruGolf carries an Amazon rating of 4.1 out of five. It’s a great way to get kids interested in the sport, as verified buyer Joanne Miloro-Pirozzo reviewed: “I got it for my son for Christmas. He loves it! Best purchase ever! He played it with his dad and they played it for hours. As they say, it’s not a video game…it’s like playing on a real course!” That immersive experience is the result of a powerful sensor and swing stick combination, which includes an impact sensation for authentic feel. Play golf in your home and explore nearly 100 different courses, including world-famous venues, while discovering the quick fixes that can make all the difference in delivering consistent drives and putts. This software is compatible with any iOS or PC device, producing a 3D-rendered experience anywhere. Set up in the living room for an afternoon of practice or sneak in some playing time while at the office. This is a far more affordable and flexible alternative to in-person training approaches that are limited to a schedule and can be impacted by bad weather. Don’t let the winter turn your golf game ice-cold. Hit your first round of 2023 feeling hot with an improved swing by picking up the TruGolf Mini Golf Simulator for only $179 (reg. $249) through January 9. Prices subject to change.
