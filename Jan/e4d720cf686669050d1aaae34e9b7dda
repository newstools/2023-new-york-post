After five games to start NFL Wild Card Weekend, playoff football continues into Monday night when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Dallas Cowboys. Tampa Bay actually beat Dallas 19-3 in Week 1, but a lot has changed since then. The Cowboys finished the regular season as the top NFC wild-card team at 12-5, while the 8-9 Buccaneers are only in the postseason because they won the feeble NFC South. Tampa Bay is the only sub-.500 team in the playoffs, and it is reflected in the betting lines. Even though the Buccaneers get to play at home, most sportsbooks favor the Cowboys by 2.5 points. Dallas is the more complete team in this matchup, ranking top five in both points per game scored and points allowed per game. It earned its 12-5 record for a reason and has dangerous playmakers in wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and running back Tony Pollard. Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady won’t go down easy, though, and this should still be a competitive game despite Tampa Bay having the worse roster.
