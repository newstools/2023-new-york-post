She thinks they’re good fellas. Sharon Stone, 64, said she’s worked with “misogynistic” Hollywood actors in her decadeslong career, but noted her “Casino” co-stars, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, didn’t behave that way while they shot the 1995 drama. “I’ve worked with some of the biggest stars in the business, who will literally talk through my close-up, telling me what they think I should do,” the “Basic Instinct” star told Variety this week. The 1996 Oscar nominee continued: “They’re so misogynistic — now, that is not Robert De Niro. That is not Joe Pesci, that is not those guys.” Stone didn’t name any problematic stars in the interview. The mother of three sons did acknowledge that she’s “not the most popular actor in town” because people don’t want to hear her “f – – king opinions.” “Maybe because of my devotion, maybe because I’m just kind of a weirdo,” Stone mused. “But I’m just in it to be present.” Stone was present on “Saturday Night Live” last week for Sam Smith’s set. The “Unholy” singer premiered the title track for their upcoming album, “Gloria,” on the Jan. 21 episode. The performance began with Smith surrounded by a 16-piece choir. Stone laid on a blinged-out bed and stared off into space for the entire song. She sported a black dress and sparkling gold heels for her appearance. “I’m listening. I’m listening and allowing it to be alive in my heart,” Stone said of her “SNL” cameo. “I think that what we really wanted was that idea of an apparition — almost like [Russian-French painter] Erté. Sam has asked me to do the music video, so I’m sure that’s going to be quite interesting to see how they would like to process that.” Stone actually played the titular character in the 1999 film “Gloria,” portraying a woman who risks her life to protect a young boy from mobsters.
