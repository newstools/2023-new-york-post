The Mother of Dragons has spoken. “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke said Friday that she has been actively avoiding watching HBO’s “House of the Dragon,” reports Entertainment Weekly. “It’s too weird,” said Clarke at the Sundance Film Festival. “I’m so happy it’s happening. I’m so over the moon [about] all the awards. Everyone who’s made it,” Despite not watching the show, the “Star Wars” actress gave a shout-out to one of the show-runners, Miguel Sapochnik, who helped the former Targaryen direct several of the most beloved episodes of the fantasy show. “Love him. Brilliant. Wonderful,” said Clarke. ” “I just can’t do it. It’s so weird. It’s so strange. It’s kind of like someone saying, ‘You want to go to this school reunion that’s not your year? You want to go to that school reunion?’ That’s kind of how it feels. I’m avoiding it.” Clarke was nominated for four Emmy awards for her role as doomed Westeros ruler  Daenerys Targaryen.  “House of the Dragon” has already soared into several accolades including its win for Best Drama Series at the 2023 Golden Globes. “House of the Dragon” is set 200 years before the beginning of “Game of Thrones” and stars Emma D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen as they battle Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) and her family for the Iron Throne. The series has been renewed for a second season and the full first season is available on HBO Max.
