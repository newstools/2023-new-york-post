ATLANTA — Perhaps the injury to starting center Mitchell Robinson finally will open up some playing time for Obi Toppin in the Knicks’ frontcourt. Toppin has averaged just 10.7 minutes in six appearances since returning earlier this month from a six-week absence due to a non-displaced fracture of his right fibula. Robinson is slated to be reevaluated in three weeks — and expected to be sidelined beyond that — after undergoing surgery Thursday to repair a fractured right thumb, according to the Knicks. Reserve centers Isaiah Hartenstein and Jericho Sims are expected to split time at center in Robinson’s absence, but Tom Thibodeau said he’s also considering using Julius Randle at times in the middle as part of a smaller lineup, depending on matchups. Thibodeau went with RJ Barrett at power forward in such a configuration late in Wednesday’s home loss to the Wizards, but Toppin also could see increased playing time with Robinson sidelined, beginning with Friday’s road game against the Hawks. The former lottery pick has recorded just 2.2 points per game on 22.2 percent shooting (4-for-18) since returning to the rotation on Jan. 9 following a five-week layoff, including three games in which he has been shut out. Randle ranks in ninth place among frontcourt players in the Eastern Conference for the second straight week in the fan voting for the All-Star Game, albeit still several million votes behind leaders Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum. Randle, who is averaging 27.6 points and 13.2 rebounds over his past 22 games, remains a candidate to be named as a reserve in the East, as is Jalen Brunson. The $104 million point guard was not listed among the top 10 vote-getters at guard in the conference, but Brunson has scored at least 25 points in each of his last eight games (32.6 ppg). Former league MVP Derrick Rose ranks ninth among Eastern Conference guards in the voting, but he’s currently out of the Knicks’ rotation.
