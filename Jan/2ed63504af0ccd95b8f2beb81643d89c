Mark Ruffalo has asked fans for their well wishes after his good friend Jeremy Renner was critically injured in a freak snowplow accident. Ruffalo, 55, rushed to his Instagram Story Monday to share a message about his longtime “Avengers” co-star with his 20.8 million followers on the platform. “Prayers up for our brother on a full and speedy recovery,” the Emmy winner wrote of the “Hawkeye” star. “Please send healing goodness his way.” The pair’s first joint on-screen venture was the original “Avengers” film back in 2012. They went on to star in several other Marvel projects since then, including “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Avengers: Endgame.” Renner, 51, was left with severe injuries Sunday after a large snowplow he was using at his Nevada home ran over his leg. After losing a significant amount of blood, the actor has been receiving round-the-clock care from medics and is now said to be in a stable condition. The injury will require two surgeries to repair, CNN reported Monday. It’s unclear if both procedures had been completed by Monday evening. Renner was using his Kässbohrer PistenBully snow plow to clear a path out of his five-bedroom home after the area had been slammed by a massive snowstorm. The storm had left over 35,000 people without power in the area. A spokesperson for Renner said he was injured in Nevada “after experiencing a weather-related accident while plowing snow.” Renner was the only person injured in the plow accident, according to the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, whose “major accident investigation team” is looking into the circumstances surrounding the incident. A host of famous names have already sent their thoughts and prayers to the actor after news of the accident came to light, including James Gunn, Robert Patrick, and Tara Strong. Renner last month tweeted about the snowfall at his northern Nevada property, writing, “Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke.”
