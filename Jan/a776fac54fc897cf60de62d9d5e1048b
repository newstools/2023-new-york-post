College athlete Catherine Gurd opened 2023 with a new moniker. Gurd ushered in the new year on Saturday by going viral after attending the College Football Playoff semifinal between Georgia and Ohio State. The Xavier University lacrosse player was featured on the broadcast, with someone later posting on TikTok, “Someone  find me this girl from Ohio State… for the love of god.” In a video shared Monday on her own TikTok page, Gurd confirmed internet speculation that she was the “Peach Bowl Girl” in question, captioning a clip, “When you kick off 2023 with a new name.” Gurd previously addressed the attention she received in an earlier TikTok clip, playfully writing, “POV your 3 seconds on tv somehow makes you go viral.” Elsewhere on social media, Gurd — who boasts 23,000 Instagram followers and counting — recapped the eventful night in a post on Sunday, when she shared the now-infamous screenshot of herself. “Buckeyes forever,” she captioned the snap. The Buckeyes suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Bulldogs in the Peach Bowl, when Ohio State kicker Noah Ruggles missed what would have been a game-winning, 50-yard field goal. Georgia topped Ohio State, 42-41, and punched its ticket to the national championship game. Georgia will face TCU on Monday in Los Angeles following the Horned Frogs’ Fiesta Bowl win over the Michigan Wolverines this past Saturday.
