The Bengals and Chiefs are set for an AFC Championship game rematch on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs seemed to have a Super Bowl trip in hand a year ago, leading the Bengals by 18 in the first half before Joe Burrow led a spirited Bengals comeback in a 27-24 overtime win. Patrick Mahomes’ health is the big question ahead of the game after the MVP frontrunner suffered a high ankle sprain in Kansas City’s divisional round win over Jacksonville. The Bengals, meanwhile, are coming off a dominant 27-10 win over the Bills to earn their spot in this AFC title game.
