The power of positive thinking may have helped Aaron Rodgers and the Packers move closer to the playoffs. The Packers, now one win away from a postseason berth, have won four of their last five following a sluggish start, including Sunday’s 41-17 blowout of the Vikings. For Rodgers, though, he believes looking inward helped contribute to Green Bay’s sudden change in trajectory. “I do believe in the power of manifestation and I do believe in momentum and I believe very strongly in the force of the mind. And when you start to believe something strongly, some miraculous things can happen,” Rodgers said after the Packers’ Week 17 victory, per NFL.com. Though Rodgers, 39, admitted things “didn’t look great for a while,” he’s proud of the way he and his teammates rallied together. “I was resigned to some of those realities being possible. And when I took my mind there, I had a peace about it. I had a peace about all of it. Whatever was supposed to happen, I was surrendered to that reality — with also the resolute mindset that we could still get back in this thing,” Rodgers said of the Packers, who endured a five-game skid in the middle of the season. “And I think that’s what I’m most proud of, for myself and our team, is that there were a lot of different things that could happen, and we stuck together and we put ourselves in position to do something special.” The Packers now stand at 8-8 and can clinch the seventh and final seed in the NFC playoff race with a win over the Lions on Sunday night. The Lions previously defeated the Packers in November, 15-9, when Rodgers threw three interceptions in the game.
