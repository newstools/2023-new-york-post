Ezra Miller has pled guilty Friday morning to a misdemeanor unlawful trespass in a Vermont burglary case, a rep for Miller told The Post. “Ezra Miller pled guilty this morning to a misdemeanor unlawful trespass in Vermont Superior Court and accepted the conditions imposed by the court,” read a statement provided to The Post from attorney Lisa Shelkrot, on behalf of the actor. “Ezra would like to thank the court and the community for their trust and patience throughout this process, and would once again like to acknowledge the love and support they have received from their family and friends, who continue to be a vital presence in their ongoing mental health,” the statement continued. A plea deal was filed with the Vermont Superior Court’s Criminal Division Thursday, stating that Miller, 30, would plead guilty to unlawful trespass, and the single counts of burglary and petit larceny would be waived, according to legal documents published by Deadline. “The Flash” star originally pleaded not guilty to felony burglary charges in October, after being accused of illegally entering their neighbor’s home in Stamford, and stealing three bottles of liquor: gin, vodka and rum. The embattled actor had quite the year in 2022. Miller — who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns — faced assault and abuse allegations on top of other legal woes. Back in August, Miller broke their silence in a statement provided to Variety, saying they would seek treatment for “complex mental health issues.” “Having recently gone through a time of intense crisis, I now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment,” Miller said in the statement. “I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.”
