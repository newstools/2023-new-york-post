Julian Sands’ family has broken their silence, thanking Southern California law enforcement officials for their continued search to find the missing “A Room With a View” star. The 65-year-old British actor was last seen hiking in the Mount Baldy area before his wife, Evgenia Citkowitz, reported him missing on Friday, Jan. 13. “Our heartfelt thanks to the compassionate members of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department who are coordinating the search for our beloved Julian, not least the heroic search teams listed below who are braving difficult conditions on the ground and in the air to bring Julian home,” read the family’s statement, shared Monday by the department. “We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support,” they added. The Post has contacted a representative for Sands for comment. His son, Henry, 37, who is also an experienced hiker, flew home from London last week to retrace his father’s footsteps but had to stop due to harsh weather. Poor visibility and icy conditions in the mountainous region have also delayed search and rescue crews’ efforts. The Sheriff’s department cited a high wind warning on Monday that prohibited the use of helicopters. A Silver Volvo believed to belong to Sands was found in the car park where he is believed to have left it before setting out on his hike. His family had the snow-covered vehicle towed away. Attempts to ping his iPhone failed on Jan. 15 “due to the lack of cell service and most likely cell phone power failure,” the department has since revealed. However, a “delayed ping” generated from his phone showed movement even after he was reported missing. It traced a possible location as a trail to the Mount Baldy summit, but on-ground searchers and helicopters did not find anything. Starting his career in the 1980s, Sands has been known for performing in such films as “Arachnophobia,” “Warlock” and “Leaving Las Vegas.” He also appeared on “24” in 2006 and on Season 8 of “Dexter” in 2013.
