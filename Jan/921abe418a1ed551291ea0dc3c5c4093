Kliff Kingsbury is on an indefinite exotic holiday. Kingsbury was fired by the Cardinals after the team finished a disappointing 4-13 this past season. On Fox Sports’ NFL pregame show on Saturday, Peter Schrager reported that Kingsbury has no intention of coaching in 2023. “One of the guys who’s being mentioned as an offensive coordinator candidate for everywhere from New England to L.A. [the Rams] is recently-fired Kliff Kingsbury. I don’t know if this is breaking news or not — Kliff Kingsbury’s in Thailand right now. He bought a one-way ticket to Thailand,” Schrager said. “He’s already been contacted by several different teams about whether he’d like to interview for a job. He said, ‘No, I’m good.’ He’s being paid five years guaranteed by the Arizona Cardinals. That check hits every two weeks. He’s going to take his time before he figures out if he wants to come back to football. For now he has told all teams that he is not interested in returning at the moment.” It is unknown how many millions Kingsbury, 43, is still owed by the Cardinals. It’s also possible that his contract has offset language, meaning that if he took another coaching job he would be effectively working for free. Football coaches are a different breed and many actually do choose that option. Matt Patricia, for example, worked on Bill Belichick’s Patriots staff the past two seasons despite being owed guaranteed money by the Lions. While they haven’t been photographed together across the hemisphere just yet, Kingsbury’s girlfriend, Veronica Bielik, has recently posted photos on Instagram from Thailand and Cambodia.
