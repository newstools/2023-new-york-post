The Plano Police Department has issued an arrest warrant for Cowboys rookie defensive end Sam Williams, stemming from a car crash he was involved in last month. The misdemeanor warrant is for reckless driving, the Plano PD told TMZ on Wednesday. Further details about the allegation were not disclosed. “At this time, there is no plan to find and arrest” Williams, a police spokesperson said, adding that   the 23-year-old NFL player “has been contacted to turn himself in.” If Williams is stopped by police before he turns himself in, “he would be arrested then,” police said. It is unclear if the arrest warrant will affect Williams’ availability for Dallas’ wild-card matchup against the Buccaneers in Tampa on Monday. Williams’ black Corvette struck an Infiniti that was attempting to cross in front of him in Plano, Texas. on Dec. 22. The incident occurred less than five miles from the Cowboys’ headquarters in Frisco. “I’m okay everyone so is the other person that was involved,” Williams tweeted after the crash. Both Williams and the driver in the other car, who police said was a 71-year-old, were taken to the hospital for precautionary reasons. Photos from the aftermath of the crash show Williams’ vehicle totaled on a tow truck. “You’re looking at the car like, man, but God works in mysterious ways,” Williams said after the crash, adding that he had a couple scratches on his head and soreness in his neck. “I know he has something in store for me.” Williams said he was returning from work and heading home when the crash occurred. He missed the Cowboys’ 40-34 win over the Eagles on Dec. 24. Williams — whom the Cowboys selected out of Ole Miss in the second round of the 2022 draft — has been a standout in his rookie season, recording four sacks and three fumble recoveries.
