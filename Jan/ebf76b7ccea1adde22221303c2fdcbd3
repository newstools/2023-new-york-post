Patrick Mahomes is presenting an aura of health. The presumptive NFL MVP suffered a high-ankle sprain during the Chiefs’ 27-20 win over the Jaguars on Saturday. Nonetheless, the quarterback on Wednesday declared all systems go for the AFC Championship game — and exited the press conference without a limp. “It’s doing good,” Mahomes told reporters of his ankle, according to ESPN. “I’ve done a few days of treatment, a few days of rehab. Excited to get on the practice field and kind of test it out and see where I’m at. But it’s feeling good so far. “I felt better than I thought I was going to be after the game. Moving on it during the game definitely hurt. But after the game, I was able to rest it and kind of ice it up and do different stuff like that. I felt in a little bit better position and obviously the next morning felt a little bit better, and then I’ve continued to get better throughout the week, so we’ll see how I feel today at practice.” He said he is going to keep pushing to see what his limits will be on Sunday. “I’ll have to find ways to be able to push off and be able to still make the throws the right way,” he said. “I’ll push it a little bit today and then the next day and then the next day again and see what I can do then. Not re-aggravate the injury, obviously, but push it to see what I’ll be able to do on Sunday.” The Chiefs are one-point home underdogs against the Bengals, with a trip to Super Bowl 2023 on the line.
