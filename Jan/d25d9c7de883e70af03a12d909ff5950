Former NFL running back Peyton Hillis was discharged from a Florida hospital nearly three weeks after he saved his two kids from drowning. On Thursday, Hillis’ sister Hayley Davis revealed a positive update on the 37-year-old’s road to recovery in an endearing Facebook post. “Peyton was discharged today from the hospital!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything health wise is looking good and has all improved— truly a miracle!!,” Davis said. Davis said the horrifying ordeal “rocked” the lives of their family after an unresponsive Hillis was airlifted to the hospital from Pensacola Beach on Jan. 4. Davis, who also jumped in the water to help rescue the children, was transported to the hospital by ambulance. “I remember seeing Peyt laid out on the sand unable to move and my mom having to run back and forth between us as the medics helped each of us. I just kept praying that Peyt would be ok,” Davis said. “God has truly been with us and has carried us through. I am so thankful to know a mighty God during good times and bad.” The former NFL running back was initially in critical condition following the rescue. He took a turn for the better when he was taken off a ventilator in the ICU and began breathing on his own on Jan. 11. “A hero,” Hillis’ girlfriend Angela Cole said on Instagram. “So proud of this man and so incredibly grateful for family and this incredible hospital.” Before he was released from the hospital, Hillis received a surprise visit from Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith. The former Cowboys star shared a snap sitting alongside Hillis, who lay in his hospital bed. “I had the opportunity to visit a recovering hero this week,” Smith tweeted. “Stay strong, Peyton! Praying for his healing.” Hillis was selected in the seventh round by the Denver Broncos in the 2008 NFL Draft. The former running back also played for the Browns, Chiefs and Giants. Hillis retired from football in 2015, amassing 2,832 yards and 23 touchdowns across his professional career.
