An upstate community is reeling after a Syracuse preteen was killed in a drive-by shooting Monday night after buying a gallon of milk from a local store. Brexialee Torres, 11, was shot in the torso around 7:43 p.m. as she exited the Food King at the intersection of Oakwood Avenue and Martin Luther King East, Syracuse.com reported. Brexialee was transported to Upstate University Hospital, where she later died. Appearing at the scene shortly after the incident, Syracuse Police Chief Joe Cecile explained that the shooter pulled up in a car at the intersection and fired at a 19-year-old man standing nearby, Syracuse.com said. The teen target was shot in the leg but is expected to survive. Thus far, police have not released any information about the suspect vehicle. The Syracuse Police Department did not return The Post’s request for comment. Loved ones and activists honored Brexialee Tuesday afternoon with a 3 p.m. one-mile march from Salt City Market to the scene of the shooting. An open discussion at the intersection will be followed at 5 p.m. by a vigil held by Rebirth SYR. “The only way it will change is if we come together,” Jennifer Baxtron, founder of Mothers for Justice Syracuse, told Syracuse.com. “Let’s come together and come up with solutions.” Local activist Hasahn “Haz” Bloodworth also mourned Brexialee’s killing in a Facebook post. “Far too many times we have been burdened into these very unfortunate, sad and unnecessary situations!” he wrote. “In my community we ALL lost a child last night so moving forward, we will treat it as such!” Meanwhile, Cecile urged the community to stay vigilant as they tried to track down the shooter. “It is a joint effort,” he told the outlet. “There are folks out there that know who’s toting the guns better than we do.”
