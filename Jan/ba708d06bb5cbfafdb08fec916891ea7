Let’s be real — your small business is like your baby: you treasure it, you care for it and you’re investing in its future. More, as your brand’s caregiver, you’re likely building and growing it from the ground up, from hiring employees, assessing revenue and preparing payroll statements. However, you may not be a CFO (not to mention, you may not have the in-depth expertise to spearhead your finances to a T). That’s where QuickBooks comes in. QuickBooks Online is, by and large, the must-use platform for managing your small business. Its full-fledged ecosystem of products help to accelerate your business to focus on your bottom line and long-term growth. So, if you’re an entrepreneur — especially a Gen Z or millennial — then you’ll adore the convenience and modernity of QuickBooks Online’s brand-new offering, its Free Guided Setup. With this nifty feature, businesses who sign up for QuickBooks Online will have access to a QuickBooks expert who will help them set up their new account for free. We’ll reiterate, for free. QuickBooks Online is backed with a 30-day free trial to test the platform for your online business. Better yet, if you buy a plan now, you’ll receive 50% off for three months. The plans include Simple Start (now $15 a month), Essentials (now $28 a month), Plus (now $43 a month) and Advanced (now $100 a month). All plans are clad with services to organize and file income and expenses, invoices and payments, tax deductions, general reports, receipt capture, mileage tracking, cash flow, sales and sales tax, estimates and contractors, with more add-ons available with each progressive plan. Uniquely, QuickBooks Online rolled out a new connect 1 sales channel, allowing small businesses to connect their QuickBooks Online account to Amazon, Shopify or eBay stores. With QuickBooks Online — especially with the new installment of its Free Guided Setup — you’ll have all the tools to help you succeed at your disposal. By auto-tracking your income and expenses, you’ll always know where your small business stands. We stand by QuickBooks Online because, unlike competing platforms, you’ll now have a guide with you to properly setup your account. When it comes to your small business, you certainly want to ensure that all of your sensitive financial information (and, thus, your employee’s personal information) is executed the right way — and this new feature fits the bill. When setting up your QuickBooks Online account, an expert will pave the way for you so you don’t have to worry about navigating the platform sans solo. From connecting your banks and credit cards to automating the tasks you perform most, there hasn’t been a better time to invest in your small business and get your finances in check. Setup aside, QuickBooks Online will equip you with all of the best practices to learn the platform with confidence. That’s right, it won’t just be another boring, difficult-to-follow log of numbers that you just have to cross off your to-do list. With QuickBooks Online’s full suite of features, you’ll want to use it to enhance your small business’ workflow and organization tenfold. QuickBooks Online’s MO is payroll that’s easy to run, from day one, so you won’t have to fret about understanding how to submit gross pay, deductions and other intricate details for your employees.
