Antonio Brown’s Snapchat account has been suspended in the wake of the former NFL receiver posting a sexually explicit image of the mother of his children, TMZ reported Tuesday. Chelsie Kyriss addressed the disturbing ordeal on her Instagram Story on Tuesday, noting she is “very well aware” of Brown’s post in question — which has been deleted —  that featured the parties involved engaging in a sexual act. “I have reported his page and all pictures,” Kyriss said. “Unfortunately Snapchat is allowing him to repost. I am very sorry for any of your kids that follow him and used to look at him as a role model.” She continued, “I do not condone these actions as you are aware I have kids in involved as well.” The incident is said to be under investigation. Under Snapchat’s Community Guidelines in relation to sexually explicit content, the platform prohibits “accounts that promote or distribute pornographic content.” Further, it has a “zero tolerance for bullying or harassment of any kind.” Brown, 34, was embroiled in a previous Snapchat scandal in November, when he allegedly shared a Photoshopped nude image of Gisele Bündchen, the ex-wife of his former Buccaneers teammate, Tom Brady. The incident marked the latest chapter in a string of bizarre social-media attacks against Brady, who advocated for Brown in the past. Brown last played in the NFL in January 2022, when he infamously exited a Buccaneers game against the Jets mid-contest, shedding his gear and walking out of MetLife Stadium shirtless.
