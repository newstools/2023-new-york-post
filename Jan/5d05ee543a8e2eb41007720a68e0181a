Josh Allen arrived at Highmark Stadium on Sunday with Damar Hamlin on his chest. The Bills quarterback was wearing a sweatshirt and hat with Hamlin’s No. 3 on it. Inside the No. 3 on his sweatshirt, according to CBS’s Tracy Wolfson, was written: “If you get a chance to show some love today do it! It won’t cost you nothing – Damar Hamlin.” After the Bills tweeted out a video of Allen’s arrival, Hamlin retweeted it saying, “That’s My Quarterback.” Hamlin, 24, will be on everyone’s mind on Sunday in Buffalo when the Bills play their first game since Monday, when Hamlin collapsed on the field in Cincinnati and had to be revived after suffering cardiac arrest. Less than a week later, Hamlin remains in critical condition but has continued to improve. He is now breathing on his own and his neurological function is “excellent,” the Bills said Saturday in a statement. Hamlin, who is reportedly set to watch the Bills take on the Patriots from the hospital, also had his teammates on his mind. “GameDay.. Nothing I Want More Than To Be Running Out That Tunnel With My Brothers,” Hamlin tweeted. “God Using Me In A Different Way Today. Tell Someone You Love Them Today! let’s go @BuffaloBills.” Tributes were pouring in for Hamlin on Sunday morning, both in Orchard Park and across the country in the leadup to other NFL games. As they warmed up, most players were wearing T-shirts that read, “Love for Damar.” In Miami, Jets rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner wore Hamlin’s jersey during warmups. Tailgate parties outside of Highmark Stadium were clad with fans wearing T-shirts with the No. 3 on them and others holding signs in support of Hamlin. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was also in attendance for the Bills-Patriots game, donning a No. 3 cap, per the Boston Globe. Former Bills running back LeSean McCoy was also at the game sporting a Hamlin jersey. In stadiums across the league, the three on the 30-yard line marker was outlined in Bills colors in honor of Hamlin.
