Travis Kelce feasted on the Jaguars Saturday. As the Chiefs defeated Jacksonville 27-20 to advance to the AFC Championship Game, Kelce was a monster. He caught 14 balls for 98 yards and two touchdowns. As the game developed, it became astonishing how frequently he was so open. “Not sure I understand the Jags defensive strategy,” quipped FS1 host Colin Cowherd. “The ‘Don’t worry too much about Travis Kelce’ thing doesn’t feel like it’s working.” Richard Sherman, the former All-Pro defensive back, also questioned what Jacksonville was doing. “Imagine allowing the @Chiefs to get the ball to Kelce 14 TIMES?!!!!” Sherman asked incredulously. “No double no extra attention Smh.” Former Rams offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth also questioned how Kelce was being left so open, tweeting: ‘What are they doing?” ESPN’s Mina Kimes replied by sharing a chart showing the Jaguars were guarding the future Hall of Fame tight end with a hodgepodge of defenders. “NOT IDEAL,” Kimes tweeted. It didn’t matter if it was Patrick Mahomes throwing the ball or if it was Chad Henne, who replaced Mahomes for a stretch in the second quarter when the starter suffered an ankle injury. The ball was going to Kelce, and he was going to catch it. The Chiefs face the winner of the Bills-Bengals matchup in the AFC Championship. If the Bengals win, the Chiefs would host. If it is the Bills, the game will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta after the Bills-Bengals Week 17 matchup was canceled due to safety Damar Hamlin’s suffering cardiac arrest on the field.
