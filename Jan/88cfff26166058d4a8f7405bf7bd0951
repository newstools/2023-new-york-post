No pain, no “Plane.” Gerard Butler accidentally rubbed phosphoric acid into his eyes while filming his upcoming action flick “Plane,” saying the experience felt like he was “burning alive” The 53-year-old made the revelation during an appearance on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” Wednesday, saying the accident occurred as he attempted to repair a faulty aircraft on set. “Now I’m sticking my hand in between these two wheels, kind of pretending that I know what I’m doing,” Butler recalled. “Every time I bring my hands out, they’re covered in blood and green fluid, right? And I’m like, ‘I don’t know what this green fluid is.’ “ “I’m rubbing my face and, suddenly, it’s in my throat. It’s in my mouth. It’s up my nose. It’s in my eyes,” he continued. “It’s burning my face, and I mean burning.” To add insult to injury, Butler said that accident happened on the hottest day of filming in Puerto Rico. In addition to being covered in blood and acid, the actor was also drenched in sweat. After the film crew realized that the green fluid was phosphoric acid, there was a commotion on how best to get the substance off of Butler’s body. Some suggested the star wash his face while others said doing so would only aggravate it. According to the CDC website, the person affected should wash their face immediately and seek medical help. “I’m just, like, burning alive … So it was intense. It actually burned for hours,” Butler stated, without revealing how he ended up removing the acid. The action hero has since fully recovered and joked that the incident was “great for the sequence” that they were filming. “Anything for the work!” the Scottish star quipped, causing Meyers to burst into a fit of laughter. “Plane” — which sees Butler play a pilot who makes an emergency landing in hostile territory — lands in theaters Jan. 13. The big-budget flick stars “Ghost” legend Tony Goldwyn and Marvel star Mike Colter.
