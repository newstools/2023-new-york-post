The college football season is down to one game. It’s the defending national champions Georgia taking on upstart TCU. Oddsmakers thought the Bulldogs were the best team in college football all season, and that shows again on Monday with Georgia laying 13 points. While TCU got some help from Jim Harbaugh’s questionable coaching decisions and a highly debatable non-touchdown call from the replay booth, give the Horned Frogs credit. TCU’s offense hung 51 points and racked up 488 total yards against Michigan’s No. 6-ranked defense. These two will matchup at 7:30 p.m. ET and will be aired on ESPN. The biggest surprise in that game was TCU rushing for 263 yards against a Michigan defense that was one of the best in the regular season. The Horned Frogs will need similar success on the ground versus Georgia, so the Dawgs can’t just pin their ears back and go after quarterback Max Duggan. It won’t be easy. Georgia ranks second defending the run, giving up just 80 yards per game. I had Ohio State in the semifinals because I thought the Buckeyes were the only team in the field that could possibly upset the Bulldogs. TCU’s offense is good, but Ohio State has top-15 NFL talent at quarterback and receiver. I’m also concerned that TCU’s defensive front will get pushed around. Michigan ran for 4.7 yards per carry and they were playing from behind most of the game. If UGA gets an early lead, they will be able to lean on a TCU defense that finished 70th against the run this season. I don’t love laying 13 in a title game but I really think Georgia got past its biggest obstacle in the semifinals. TCU will put up a fight but look for the Bulldogs to pull away in the second half and cover the number. THE PLAY: Georgia -13 (BetMGM)
