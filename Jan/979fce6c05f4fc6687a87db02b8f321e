A California property widely known for attracting A-list renters and blending in with its desert surrounds is looking for a new owner. The creators of Joshua Tree’s Invisible House are moving on to their next big building project and looking to sell their 5,500-square-foot, “2001: A Space Odyssey”-inspired estate for $18 million. “I just drew a rectangle on paper and said, ‘OK, we’ll build this,’” Chris Hanley told the Wall Street Journal of the blueprint for his three-bedroom, four-bathroom creation. “I thought it could just be a monolithic, reflective, ultra-minimal thing.” Hanley and his wife Roberta have been living at the abode — the exterior of which is composed fully of reflective glass — since they finished constructing it in 2019, but are now selling it and shifting their energy to their new Starburst Container House, also located in Joshua Tree. The statement property is listed with Aaron Kirman and Matt Adamo of AKG Christie’s International Real Estate. In addition to its unique, landscape-reflecting facade, the 225-foot-long “smart” home — which is cantilevered 100 feet off the ground — also boasts a prefab guest house, a 100-foot indoor “solar” pool and has been featured on Netflix’s “The World’s Most Amazing Vacation Rentals.” It’s set on 90 acres of land, all furniture is included in the price — and it has previously been visited by Lizzo, Diplo, Lil Kim and Demi Lovato, among others “I think Demi Lovato saw aliens there,” Chris Hanley told the Journal of the pop star’s experience at the home. The property’s $18 million price point makes it the most expensive property in Joshua Tree by far. But its uniqueness, fame and the fact that it is arguably being sold as a piece of livable artwork make the dollar figure achievable, Kirman added. “It’s definitely expensive for Joshua Tree,” he said. “But good pieces of art command premium prices.”
