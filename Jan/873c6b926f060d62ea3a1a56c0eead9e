Chad Green will be on a Yankees rival when he is able to pitch again. The righty reliever agreed to a two-year contract with the Blue Jays worth $8.5 million, according to Shi Davadi of Sportsnet. There are options in the deal for 2025 and 2026. The 31-year-old Green appeared in 14 games and had a 3.00 ERA and 1.20 WHIP in 2022. He did not pitch after suffering discomfort in his throwing arm in May — and he ultimately needed Tommy John surgery. Green had been with the Yankees since 2016. He made 272 appearances and 24 starts with a career record of 33-22, a 3.17 ERA, 1.022 WHIP and 11 saves.
