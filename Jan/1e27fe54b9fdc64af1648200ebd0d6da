Two teams fighting for playoff berths will meet in Seattle on Sunday when the Jets face the Seahawks. The Jets have dropped four straight after a dismal effort last Thursday against Jacksonville. On a positive note, Mike White will return as starting quarterback. It’s positive any time the starting quarterback isn’t Zach Wilson, so White should give the offense a boost. The Seahawks also come into this game reeling after a hot start. Seattle has lost five of six and quarterback Geno Smith has cooled off, with five interceptions over that span. Though on paper this is a matchup of two struggling teams, I give the Jets an edge on the road with White under center. The team looked lifeless on Dec. 22 against the Jaguars. Maybe some of that had to do with Wilson being the quarterback or the Jets having lost three tough games in a row. Either way, I expect a much more focused Jets squad on Sunday. I think Seattle’s offensive line will really struggle to block the Jets’ defensive front. The Seahawks have allowed the 10th most sacks in the NFL, while the Jets have recorded 40 sacks through 15 games (eighth best in the NFL). Both teams have dropped close games recently, but I have the Jets clearly the better team in my power rankings, with White at quarterback. Seattle has lost six straight games against the spread. Look for that streak to reach seven on Sunday. The play: Jets moneyline (-125).
