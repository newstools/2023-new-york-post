Star Wars is getting a whole lot cuter with the return of “The Mandalorian” this Spring. The first trailer for the third season of “The Mandalorian” dropped Monday, with the surprise feature of Babu Frick, a fan-favorite character who stole the hearts of many Star Wars fans challenging Grogu (Baby Yoda) for his spot as “the cutest” in the galaxy. “Babu Frik is all I care about,” tweeted one excited user. “WAIT IS GROGU GONNA INTERACT WITH BABU FRIK,” exclaimed another. “BABU FRIK SIGHTING! I REPEAT! BABU IS BACK BABY,” chimed in a third person. Babu Frik’s debut came during the franchise’s ninth film, “The Rise of Skywalker,” as Resistance operatives Poe (Oscar Issac), Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) sought the tiny yet “well-regarded” machinist for his expert droid hacking skills, according to his official Star Wars bio. Frik was voiced by Shirley Henderson, who viewers may recall as the ghost Moaning Myrtle in the “Harry Potter” franchise. The brand-new trailer teases more high-stakes adventures for Mando and Grogu, alongside old and new allies as the duo faces dangerous new enemies. Meanwhile, the juvenile Jedi is also seen using the Force to greater effect, which fans saw first develop in “The Book of Boba Fett.” The trailer also takes fans back to the galactic metropolis world of Coruscant, which was a center of power during the prequel films, as well as Disney’s most recent series “Andor.” “The journeys of the Mandalorian through the ‘Star Wars’ galaxy continue. Once a lone bounty hunter, Din Djarin has reunited with Grogu,” reads Disney’s official synopsis. Season 3 of “The Mandalorian” is set to drop out of hyperspace on March 1 on Disney+.
