Accused cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has asked a judge to keep secret the identities of two people who agreed to sign his bond, claiming they’d face harassment if their names were released. Bankman-Fried was charged in a Manhattan federal indictment in December on eight counts related to an alleged sprawling fraud, money-laundering and campaign-finance scheme and then sprung from custody. His conditions for release required his parents to co-sign a $250 million bond and two other unspecified persons also ink lesser individual bonds. In a letter filed Tuesday, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer asked Judge Lewis Kaplan that the two co-signers remain anonymous. “In recent weeks, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents have become the target of intense media scrutiny, harassment, and threats. Among other things, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents have received a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm,” his lawyer, Mark Cohen, wrote. “Consequently, there is serious cause for concern that the two additional sureties would face similar intrusions on their privacy as well as threats and harassment if their names appear unredacted on their bonds or their identities are otherwise publicly disclosed,” Cohen added. At the suspect’s arraignment Tuesday afternoon, Kaplan agreed to keep the names hidden for now – but said he’d allow reporters and members of the public to file requests that they be unsealed. The judge added that he will rule on whether to publicly disclose the names if any unsealing applications are made. Federal prosecutors took no position on the request, according to Cohen’s letter. Bankman-Fried pleaded pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the charges against him. Federal prosecutors allege he defrauded investors and customers of his crypto exchange FTX by diverting funds from the platform to his hedge fund Alameda Research.
