The Jets are expected to interview a veteran coach for their vacant offensive coordinator position. The team has plans to speak with Dolphins quarterbacks coach and passing-game coordinator Darrell Bevell, NFL Network reported on Monday. Bevell, 53, just finished his first season with Miami, who lost to the Bills on Sunday in the AFC wild-card round. After parting ways with Mike LaFleur, the Jets have already interviewed Eagles passing game coordinator Kevin Patullo and former Colts offensive coordinator Marcus Brady for their OC opening. They’re scheduled to interview Patriots tight ends coach Nick Caley on Tuesday, according to Sports Illustrated. Bevell was the Jaguars’ offensive coordinator last season, finishing the final four games as their interim head coach after Urban Meyer’s firing. He was also the interim coach for the Lions’ last five games in 2020 after Matt Patricia was fired, having spent 2019 and ’20 as their offensive coordinator. Bevell is perhaps best known for his seven-year stint as the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator from 2011-17, during which he won Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos but became the center of attention for a questionable decision in Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots a year later. Instead of giving the ball to Marshawn Lynch on second-and-goal from the 1-yard line while down by four with 26 seconds left, the Seahawks opted for a quick pass that was intercepted by Malcolm Butler, sealing the game for the Patriots.
