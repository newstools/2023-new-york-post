Hundreds of mourners lined the front lawn of the iconic Graceland mansion Sunday to pay their respects at a memorial for Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis’ only child who died Jan. 12. Presley, 54, suffered a deadly cardiac arrest, and will be buried on the Memphis, Tenn., mansion’s grounds — next to her revered father and beloved son Benjamin, who died by suicide in 2020. The late singer’s service — packed with star-studded speeches and performances — opened with a singing of “Amazing Grace” by Jason Clark and the Tennessee Mass Choir, followed by a performance of “To Sheila” by Billy Corgan. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, then read “A Tribute to the Children,” which was followed by Alanis Morrissette performing “Rest.” Presley mother, Priscilla, spoke at the service, along with Riley Keough, her oldest daughter. Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose performed the band’s song “November Rain.” Lisa Marie Presley’s three daughters, Keough and 14-year-old twins Finley and Harper are expected to inherit Graceland through a trust in the wake of their mother’s death. The mansion — worth an estimated half-billion dollars — is where Elvis died at 42; Lisa Marie received the estate on her 25th birthday, becoming its sole owner. The mom of three spoke of being buried in Graceland in a Playboy interview, 20 years before her passing. “The back lawn of Graceland is a graveyard, basically. How many people have a family grave in the backyard? she said. “All the graves are lined up and there’s a spot there, waiting for me, right next to my grandmother.” “I’m sure I’ll end up there,” she said. “Or I’ll shrink my head and put it in a glass box in the living room. I’ll get more tourists to Graceland that way.”
