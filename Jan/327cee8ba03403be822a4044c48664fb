New York’s lefty minds insist Gov. Kathy Hochul’s Court of Appeals chief pick Hector LaSalle is a fire-breathing right-winger. It’s utter garbage, if you simply look at the cases the critics cite as evidence. In other words, LaSalle follows the law, rather than the far-left wish list. His critics are plainly pushing for a chief judge (and swing vote on the state’s top court) who’ll twist the law, legislating the progressive agenda from the bench so voters can’t revolt. That’s why extremist insiders led by state Sen. Mike Gianaris (D-Queens) are stacking the Judiciary Committee against him ahead of his confirmation hearing: They want the facts to be irrelevant. That power play, incidentally, is outraging judges across the spectrum, even as other extremists rally against the man who’d be New York’s first Hispanic chief judge. If they get their way, New York’s legal system becomes another far-left power center — and the exodus of sane, productive people from the Empire State accelerates.
