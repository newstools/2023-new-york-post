The daughter of House Minority Whip Katherine Clark was busted for allegedly spraying anti-cop graffiti and assaulting a police officer in Boston. Riley Dowell, 23, was caught spray-painting “NO COP CITY” and “ACAB” — an acronym for “all cops are bastards” — on the Parkman Bandstand Monument in Boston Common during a protest on Saturday, according to police. Dowell — who is non-binary and was identified as “Jared Dowell” by police — was being detained for vandalism when “a group of about 20 protestors began to surround” the arresting officers. The protestors allegedly screamed profanities through megaphones in the street and blocked traffic while surrounding the arresting officers. At one point during the angry stand-off, “an officer was hit in the face and could be seen bleeding from the nose and mouth,” according to Boston police. Dowell, of Melrose, was arrested and charged with assault by means of a dangerous weapon, destruction or injury of personal property and damage of property by graffiti/tagging. Clark acknowledged her daughter’s arrest on Twitter Sunday. “Last night, my daughter was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts,” she tweeted. “I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting. This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.” Dowell was expected to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.
