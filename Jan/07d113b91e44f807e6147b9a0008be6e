A pair of twins were set to be delivered in Texas just around midnight on New Year’s Day — and ended up being born in separate years. Kali Jo Scott gave birth to her first twin baby girl Annie Jo at 11:55 p.m. on Dec. 31 and then delivered the second daughter, Effie Rose, at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, according to reports. Mother and father, Cliff Scott, had anticipated that births could come around midnight. “We had kinda joked wouldn’t it be funny if, you know with the holiday and New Year’s Eve over the weekend,” Kali Jo said, according to CBS Austin. “If they had their own birthday, and then it turned out that was more of a possibility than we realized.” She checked in early to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton for monitoring ahead of the C-section scheduled about a week and a half before her fraternal twins’ original due date, Fox 4 reported. Annie Jo was reportedly the last baby born at the hospital in 2022 and Effie Rose can boast she was the first baby born at the hospital in 2023. The parents are happy the twin girls will get to celebrate their own birthdays and have their own identities. “You always still want to make sure they have their own individual personality and know that they are special and unique. So this gets to add to that special and uniqueness that some twins don’t maybe get,” Kali Jo said. “One will always get the glitter and confetti of New Year’s Eve and one gets to kick it off with a brand-new year on New Year’s Day.” Cliff Scott added, “It kind of happened so quick we haven’t processed all of it yet.”
