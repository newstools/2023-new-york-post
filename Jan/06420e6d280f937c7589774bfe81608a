Fresh off a contentious race against Herschel Walker, junior democratic senator from Georgia Raphael Warnock has shelled out $1.15 million for a new Washington DC pad. Made up of four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, the townhome had previously sold a year prior, for $730,000 — which means the last owners walked away with a hefty profit. Warnock closed on the sale at the start of the new year, Realtor.com reported. Occupying more than 1,700 square feet, the property offers new windows for optimal sunlight, a newly updated gourmet kitchen with a wine fridge and outdoor seating for al-fresco dining. The lower level of the home offers a private rear entrance, a bedroom and a full bathroom. Patrick Joy, of Realty One Group Assets, had the listing. Much farther south in his home state, Walker also owns a 3,000-square-foot residence in Atlanta worth an estimated $745,000. In 2020, Warnock — a democrat — made history when he became the first black senator from Georgia in a runoff against incumbent Kelly Loeffler. He repeated the feat in 2022, beating Walker in another runoff and securing a full six-year term in Congress.
