A pimp described as one of “the most violent traffickers” ever prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office was sentenced to 50 years behind bars on Wednesday for forcing children into prostitution. Arthur Dawson, 31, learned his fate in Manhattan Supreme Court after he was convicted by a jury of sex trafficking of a child, promoting prostitution, and conspiracy, among other charges, in July 2022. Dawson, along with co-defendant Daniel Washington — who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in November 2022 — lured teenage girls through Facebook’s messaging service and then sold them for sex in the Bronx and other parts of New York City. The sicko once raped and choked a 17-year-old girl in a stairwell when she asked him for half of the money she had received from a client at a hotel, according to prosecutors. “Arthur Dawson ranks among the most violent traffickers this Office has ever prosecuted,” said DA Alvin Bragg in a statement. “Along with Daniel Washington, Dawson operated a horrific enterprise recruiting girls and young women to work in prostitution for their personal gain,” Bragg continued. The trial convictions for sex trafficking of a child were the first in the state following the enactment of the penal law in June 2018, meant to crack down on predators who force or manipulate children into prostitution Previously in New York, child victims had to testify against their pimps in order for prosecutors to prove a charge of sex trafficking. “By eliminating the need to prove force, fraud, or coercion for children under 18 years old, we will be able to bring stronger cases, and spare young survivors from the trauma of having to testify mere feet from their traffickers,” then-Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. said at the time of the bill’s passing.
