Prince Harry is a Maxxinista. The Duke of Sussex revealed in his explosive memoir “Spare” that he’s a fan of TK Maxx, the UK’s version of TJ Maxx, so much so that he used to have a “system” to make sure he only got the best deals. Turns out Harry, 38, enjoys a bargain on big-name brands and liked going through the store’s racks to find discounted clothes from brands like J. Crew and Gap. Harry explained in his book that his wardrobe for formal functions was paid for by an allowance given to him by his father, King Charles, but buying his casual everyday clothes was up to him. “For my everyday casual clothes, I’d go to TK Maxx, the discount store. I was particularly fond of their once-a-year sale, when they’d be flush with items from Gap or J.Crew, items that had just gone out of season or were slightly damaged,” he wrote in the book. When Harry and Meghan Markle, 41, lived in Kensington Palace, they were just a few minute’s walk from their closest TK Maxx — giving the Duke plenty of opportunities for a bargain deal. The royal even developed a “system” to get TK Maxx’s best discount. “If you timed it right, got there on the first day of the sale, you could snag the same clothes that others were paying top prices for down the high street!” Harry wrote. He would check each clothing rack item by item and if he liked how something looked, he would put it in the department store’s “red bucket” basket — but he never tried anything on before purchasing. Prince Harry’s memoir shattered the UK’s record for the best-selling non-fiction book in history, its publisher announced. He made lots of bombshell revelations in the book including the story of how he lost his virginity, getting a “frostbitten penis” at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding and getting into physical altercations with his brother.
