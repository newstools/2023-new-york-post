Collectively, we’ve become increasingly reliant upon remote work, whether it’s for professional or educational purposes, and possessing the right tools is key to that process. The Apple MacBook remains a highly popular option and, for a limited time, you can purchase one at a surprisingly low price. An Apple MacBook Air from 2017 normally sells for $999, but an ongoing deal currently drops that cost to only $379.99. Going the refurbishment route saves your bank from taking a bigger hit, but you’re certainly not settling with this machine. You’ll gain a MacBook Air that includes a Pro Retina display, 128GB of SSD Storage and an impressive Intel Core i5 processor. Plus, buying refurbished technology produces less e-waste and helps the environment — save money, save the earth! Built to handle daily tasks, web browsing, and streaming, this MacBook Air is as light as its name suggests, weighing less than three pounds and serving as an excellent travel accessory. However, it still packs some serious power, able to operate up to 12 hours on a single charge and offering Bluetooth connectivity. This MacBook’s sharp 1440×900 native resolution, intel HD graphics 6000 and WiFi accessibility ensure you’ll get the most out of streaming experiences. Plus, that Bluetooth ability allows you to sync this device to your favorite accessories. A 720p FaceTime HD camera lets you clearly communicate with family and friends anytime, while the keyboard is backlit for additional convenience. This refurbished 13.3″ MacBook Air is primed to be a welcomed addition to any workstation, whether it becomes your new primary computer or operates as a supplemental option. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to pick one up for only $379.99 (reg. $999) for a limited time. Prices subject to change.
