Byron Leftwich is out as the Buccaneers’ offensive coordinator. The Buccaneers are parting ways with the 43-year-old Leftwich following a disappointing season, which ended Monday in a 31-14 loss to the Cowboys in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reported Thursday. Leftwich, a former NFL quarterback, was Tampa Bay’s offensive coordinator for four seasons. He had worked under the team’s former head coach, Bruce Arians, during his time with the Cardinals in previous years. During the 2020 season, Leftwich’s first working with new Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, the team reached the Super Bowl and defeated the Chiefs, 31-9. Lightning didn’t strike twice for the Buccaneers a year later, however, as the team was ousted in the divisional round of the playoffs by the Rams, who went on to win Super Bowl 2022. The Buccaneers underwent major changes ahead of the 2022 regular season, with Arians stepping down as coach and moving to the front office. Defensive coordinator Todd Bowles was named his successor. Though Brady, 45, returned to the Buccaneers in March 2022 following a 40-day retirement, the team struggled throughout the regular season and ended the year at 8-9. In addition to Leftwich, “as many as five offensive assistants and two on defense are expected to be let go,” according to Stroud.
