The final week of the NFL season is always tough for bettors to navigate. Some teams are playing for playoff positioning, some have their playoff seeds determined and are resting players and others are just playing because the schedule says they have to. The Cowboys qualify as a team still playing for something, while the Commanders are just finishing out the season. The Cowboys can still win the NFC East with a victory and an Eagles loss to the Giants. Both games are being played at the same time, so Dallas will have to go all out against the foundering Commanders. It feels as if Washington starts a new quarterback every week, and the Commanders will trot out rookie Sam Howell on Sunday. I always laugh when a team starts a rookie quarterback who hasn’t played all season in the final game “to see what he’s got.” That’s not much of an audition. Howell has never taken a snap in the NFL, and head coach Ron Rivera is kind of feeding him to the wolves against a Cowboys defense that ranks third in sacks with 51 and first in forcing turnovers with 32 takeaways. The Cowboys’ defense has been exploited at times this season, but this looks like a situation in which Micah Parsons and company can feast. Dallas is still alive for the No. 1 seed in the NFC as well, but would need both Philadelphia and San Francisco to lose. Though that scenario isn’t likely, look for the Cowboys to be motivated with the division title still undecided. The play: Cowboys -7.
