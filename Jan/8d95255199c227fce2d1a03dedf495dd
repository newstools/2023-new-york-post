Could this be curtains for Martha Stewart? “I have an agreement — all of us, all my friends — we have an agreement where if we start to act like a little old lady and don’t care about what our house looks like, or it smells or anything, we get killed,” the celebrity chef, 81, confided to Yahoo Life. “We get killed, just finished.” But Stewart, who regularly wows with her saucy social thirst traps, vows she’s not going to start “living badly” just because she’s growing older. “Once you’ve lived well, you always should live well,” she quipped in the new interview. The media mogul bared her recipe for staying youthful to the outlet. Exercising, eating a healthy diet and carving out time for her loved ones are part of her daily routine. The TV personality credited Pilates and frequent gym visits for her impressive physique, emphasizing that an active lifestyle is essential. “A healthy lifestyle is very, very important to me,” she told Yahoo. “Healthy eating is very important, having a healthy existence and working.” Spending time with her two grandchildren, Truman, 10, and Jude, 11, Stewart, also keeps her young. She said she recently took the tween boys to Madagascar, where they learned to scuba dive, hike through jungles, visit primitive villages and farm seaweed. As for cutting her workload in 2023, Stewart says she hasn’t considered it. Besides hawking her home goods, Stewart also hosts a podcast, “The Martha Stewart Podcast,” and helms various TV shows, including three new ones on the Roku Channel: “Martha Gardens,” “Martha Cooks” and “Martha Holidays.” “I don’t ever think about retiring,” she added. “That’s something that’s sort of foreign to me.”
