Jamal Adams is happy as a clam after the Seahawks eliminated the Jets from playoff contention. The Seahawks beat the Jets 23-6 on Sunday, which meant that all hopes of the Jets making the postseason evaporated. Had the Jets beaten the Seahawks, they would’ve been in a scenario where they would’ve made the playoffs if they beat the Dolphins — who might have to start third-string quarterback Skylar Thompson with Tua Tagovailoa in concussion protocol and Teddy Bridgewater suffering a broken finger — in Week 18. The Patriots would have also needed to lose to the Bills for the Jets to qualify. Adams, who was traded from the Jets to the Seahawks in the 2020 offseason for a package that included two first-round picks, reveled at the news. “All 3 phases balled out yesterday! What a Team Win!!” Adams tweeted Monday. “My mentions been real quiet since yesterday…” In response to a Jets fan who informed the safety that he didn’t even play on Sunday, Adams tweeted, “Don’t be mad at me because y’all got that ass whooped AGAIN!!” Adams suffered a season-ending leg injury on a pass rush of Russell Wilson during the Seahawks’ Week 1 win over the Broncos in September. While Adams also missed five games last season and four games in 2021, it would be surprising if he is on the chopping block from the Seahawks this offseason. After the trade, the Seahawks signed the safety to a four-year contract worth over $70 million. The deal still carries $21.3 million in dead cap money for 2023.
