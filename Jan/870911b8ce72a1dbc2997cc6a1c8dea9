Aaron Rodgers is winning on and off the field. The Packers quarterback is rumored to be dating Mallory Edens, the daughter of Milwaukee Bucks owner Wes Edens. A source told Sportsgossip.com that the relationship between Rodgers and Edens, who’ve been friends for years, turned romantic a few months after things fizzled out between him and Blu Of Earth. Rodgers, 39, and Edens, 26, have not yet addressed the dating buzz. The model, who graduated from Princeton in 2018, reportedly attended Green Bay’s 41-17 win over the Vikings  at Lambeau Field on Sunday. The outlet shared a screen grab of Edens posing in Packers gear. Rodgers and Edens have been photographed on a number of occasions sitting courtside at Bucks games. They most recently were spotted together at a Lakers-Bucks game in December at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, where Edens was pictured sitting in between Rodgers and Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb. Rodgers has been friendly with the Edens family for years, as he’s a well-known Bucks fan and a beloved star athlete in Wisconsin. The reigning two-time NFL MVP purchased a one-percent stake in the Bucks in 2018. Rodgers made headlines for a number of romances throughout 2022. In April, the quarterback and his ex-fiancée, actress Shailene Woodley, called it quits after he announced the engagement in February 2021. Rodgers was also linked to Blu, the host of the “DeJa Blu” podcast, over the summer. Prior to his relationship with Woodley, Rodgers dated former NASCAR star Danica Patrick and actress Olivia Munn. The Packers, who have won four straight, can clinch a playoff berth on Sunday when they host the Lions in their regular-season finale.
