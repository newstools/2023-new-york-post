Hanif Kureishi, a British novelist and screenwriter, says he remains in the hospital, unable to move his arms or legs, after suffering a near-death experience last month. The 68-year-old “My Beautiful Laundrette” writer updated fans in a lengthy Twitter thread Friday, detailing a scary fall he said occurred at his Rome apartment on Dec. 26. He described feeling dizzy after a walk — and waking up in a “pool of blood” with his wife by his side. “I believed I was dying,” the 1986 Oscar nominee wrote. “I believed I had three breaths left.” Kureishi continued that he cannot scratch his nose, make a call or feed himself and may never be able to walk or “hold a pen” again. However, he said he is seeing “minor improvements” in recent days following an operation on his spine. The Post has contacted reps for Kureishi for comment. He said he was watching a soccer match between Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Vill when he started to feel sick. “I then experienced what can only be described [as] a scooped, semi-circular object with talons attached scuttling towards me,” he wrote. “Using what was left of my reason, I saw this was my hand, an uncanny object over which I had no agency.” Kureishi is well known for “Laundrette” — the 1985 romantic comedy-drama fronted by Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Stephen Frears. The film was nominated for a BAFTA and an Oscar. His 1990 international bestselling novel, “Buddha of Suburbia,” was made into a TV series starring David Bowie in 1993. Other Kureishi screenplays include “Sammy and Rosie Get Laid” and “London Kills Me,” which he also directed. Daniel Craig and Anne Reid starred in his drama “The Mother” in 2003.
