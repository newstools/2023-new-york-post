Will the third time be the charm for the Giants? The Eagles have had Big Blue’s number for years. The Giants badly want to change that Saturday night in Philadelphia when the teams meet for a third time this season. This one feels different, though. The Giants are a much improved and healthier team from the first time they played the Eagles in December. And the last game of the season, they did not play their starters. This team is riding momentum and a QB that is playing at an elite level. This should be a primetime thriller in the City of Brotherly Love. To give an in-depth preview of the Giants-Eagles NFC Divisional Round playoff matchup, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Brandon London, Lawrence Tynes and Paul Schwartz. Brandon also spoke with Giants OL Evan Neal and LB Jihad Ward in the locker room after a practice this week. It’s a jam-packed episode that you can listen to below, wherever you get podcasts or watch the full show below on the New York Post Sports YouTube page.
