Adam Rich — who starred in the hit tv show “Eight is Enough” — has died at the age of 54. Rich allegedly passed away Saturday in his Los Angeles home after someone entered his house and found the TV star lifeless, a family member told TMZ. Police say no foul play was involved. Rich played Nicholas Bradshaw — the youngest son in the Bradford clan — from 1977-1981 on the hit series. Other credits include “Code Red” in 1981 and “Dungeons and Dragons” in 1983. VH1 ranked Rich as number 73 on its list of the greatest 100 kid stars. Rich retired from acting in the 1980s after stating that he hated being in the spotlight. The Post reached out to Rich’s family for comment. “Life is for living, and I live my life to the fullest every day,” Rich used to say.
