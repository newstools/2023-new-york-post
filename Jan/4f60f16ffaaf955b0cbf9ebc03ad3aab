The two-man soft rock group Air Supply somehow has yet to run “all out of love” 48 years into their career. Rather than rest on their laurels, founding members Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell are hitting the road yet again for more than 30 U.S. shows this winter and spring including concerts at Staten Island’s St. George Theatre on March 10, Red Bank’s Hackensack Meridian Health Theatre on March 31, New York City’s Palladium Times Square on June 3 and Westbury’s NYCB Theatre on Aug. 5 after touring all over Singapore, Malaysia and their native Australia to close 2022. And, if the band’s Instagram is any indication, their first few gigs back in North America look like an absolute blast. Clearly, they’re not ready to say “Goodbye.” Sorry. We couldn’t help ourselves. Best of all, some shows are quite affordable to see the living legends too. In fact, we found some seats going for as low as $39 before fees on Vivid Seats at the time of publication. All prices are subject to fluctuation. Now, here’s everything you need to know about Air Supply’s upcoming tour dates.  The twosome’s tour resumes in Wheatland, CA at the Hard Rock Sacramento on Jan. 20. From there, Hitchcock and Russell will jet set to Detroit (Feb. 4), Scottsdale (Feb. 18), Bethlehem (Feb. 24), Cincinnati (March 4) and Kansas City (May 5). Air Supply’s tour runs out of, um, air supply, on Aug. 5 when they play their final show of the year at Westbury’s NYCB Theatre. A complete calendar including all tour dates, venues, show start times and links to buy tickets can be found here.  Rock groups that aren’t afraid to make you access your emotions will run rampant all over the U.S. this year.
