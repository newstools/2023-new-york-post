King Charles has had a change of heart and will give his younger brother, Prince Edward, the title of Duke of Edinburgh after reportedly mulling whether to give it to his granddaughter, Princess Charlotte, when she is older. But sources close to the royal family told the Daily Mail that the title will probably go to  Edward, the Earl of Wessex, after all — possibly as soon as March 2024 when he turns 60. Prince Edward reportedly was hurt when he heard that Charles might give the title to Prince William’s 7-year-old daughter. He was expecting the title because it had apparently been promised to him by Queen Elizabeth before she died, according to the report. Edward and Charles are said to be close, and Charles sometimes looks to Edward for advice, the Daily Mail said. “It was a slap in the face, particularly when Edward has been such a help to Charles over the Andrew farrago,” a source close to Edward told the outlet, referring to the disgraced royal’s ties to late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which caused the Queen to strip him of his royal titles and several patronages last year. “Also because the Queen had promised him the title before she died and it was always believed by Edward and [wife] Sophie that, in time, the title would then be passed down to their son, Viscount Severn,” the source added. “Now it does look like the tide is turning. Clearly the King has had time to reflect on the late Queen’s wishes.” Queen Elizabeth died in September at age 96.
