The Force is strong with Mando … and Grogu. The new trailer for the third season of Disney’s hit tv show “The Mandalorian” broke several records within the first 24 hours of dropping during the NFL wild-card playoff game on January 16, exclusively reports The Hollywood Reporter. “Mandalorian” debuted with a whopping 83.5 million views vastly outstripping the franchise’s “Obi-Wan Kenobi” which debuted on May 4th — or “Star Wars Day” — and attracted nearly 58 million viewers. “The Mandalorian” first debuted on Disney+ in November of 2019 and quickly became the flagship project of Disney due to the incredibly cute “Baby Yoda” — who has since been revealed to be named Grogu. The second season — which came out in late 2020 — has spawned two spin-off series “Ashoka” and ” The Book of Boba Fett.” “The Mandalorian will cross paths with old allies and make new enemies as he and Grogu continue their journey together,” reads the series tagline. Cast members include Pedro Pascal as Din Djarin/The Mandalorian, Amy Sedaris, Katee Sackhoff, Carl Weathers, Emily Swallow and Giancarlo Esposito. Season three will also feature the return of Sequel Trilogy favorite, Babu Frik — who helped the Resistance in the franchise’s ninth installment “The Rise of Skywalker.” Twitter users were overjoyed with the droidsmith’s return. “Babu Frik is all I care about,” tweeted one excited user. “WAIT IS GROGU GONNA INTERACT WITH BABU FRIK,” exclaimed another. Season 3 of “The Mandalorian” is set to drop out of hyperspace on March 1 on Disney+.
