Rapper Lil Tjay was busted in The Bronx on Monday after cops found loaded firearms inside the Cadillac Escalade he was riding in, according to police. The 21-year-old musician, whose real name is Tione Jayden Merritt, was in the SUV with four friends when cops pulled them over because of the vehicle’s tinted windows and a missing front license plate, cops and sources said. Four guns were confiscated by police during the traffic stop at 183rd Street and Ryer Avenue close to 4 p.m., the NYPD said. The Bronx-born rapper and the four others were taken into custody, cops said. He and two other people inside the SUV were later charged with criminal possession of a weapon. The “Brothers” artist, who is signed to Columbia Records, was in the borough to shoot a music video, according to sources and social media posts. “Video shooot today lol it’s litt,” reads a post on his Instagram story. The bust comes seven months after Lil Tjay was shot several times during an attempted robbery at an Edgewater, New Jersey, shopping plaza. Rapper Ice Spice, who Lil Tjay apparently shot the rap video with earlier Monday, also had a run-in with police around the same time in a separate incident nearby, law enforcement sources said. While the rapper, whose real name is Isis Gaston, was not arrested or charged with anything, a man who was in the car with her when it was pulled over on Walton Avenue was taken into custody around 4 p.m., sources said. Markus Grisham, 34, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, the NYPD said. He allegedly had a loaded 9 millimeter gun on him at the time of the stop, sources said.
