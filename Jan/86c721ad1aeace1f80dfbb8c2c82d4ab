Here’s a bikini that looks so good, you could eat it. One woman got a skimpy surprise when her long-awaited Skims bikini arrived — and discovered that the surface area it covered was barely larger than a Trader Joe’s tortilla chip. TikTok user Sarita shared a clip of her viral micro-kini, saying she’d purchased the $28 Fits Everybody micro triangle bralette and the matching $14 micro thong — laughing at the absurdness of the bathing suit and online shopping fail. “So if you’ve been eyeing the Skims micro bikini and wondering about the size, these are tortilla chips for scale,” she explained in the 9-second clip, which has been viewed over 5.4 million times. Sarita then shows the pale, silvery bikini with the tortilla chips sitting over the top of them — with the seams barely visible. In a follow-up clip, Sarita tried on the viral bikini over clothes, showing just how little the skimpy two-piece covers — immediately noting that it sits a lot lower than her normal swimwear. “It’s not going to work for anyone,” she said in the clip. However, she did note one reasonable use for the barely-there bikini: tanning without lines. “I would probably wear at a private pool — not a beach,” she said. “These bottoms I would wear in my backyard for cute tan lines. I would never wear this in public.” The Post has reached out to Skims for comment. Followers couldn’t believe how tiny the silver Skims set was, with a few saying they had found the same thing when they ordered it. “My sister ordered this by accident and calls it the pirate eye patch lol,” one woman joked, while one user said, “Eyepatch DUUUUPPPE.” “(opens bag of Doritos) skims dupe,” added another.
