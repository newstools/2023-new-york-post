The biggest game of the year, the Super Bowl of NCAA football, the one for all this season’s bragging rights, is finally here. On Jan. 9, Sonny Dykes’ underdog TCU Horned Frogs and Kirby Smart’s top-ranked Georgia Bulldogs will square off at Inglewood, CA’s SoFi Stadium to determine which team will be the winner of the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship. To put it lightly, tickets aren’t cheap for this hotly-anticipated David vs. Goliath-like contest. At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on seats to see TCU’s QB Max Duggan and Georgia’s QB Stetson Bennett live — both were Heisman Trophy finalists — was $342 before fees on Vivid Seats. For those hoping to get even closer to the action, 200-level seats start at $720 before fees. And if you’re a die-hard fan who wants the players to hear your cheers from the 100s, the cheapest seats we spotted for you were $971 before fees. All prices are subject to fluctuation. This year’s game starts at 4:30 p.m. PST.  Can’t miss this exciting matchup live, but you don’t have a flight or hotel booked just yet? That problem can easily be rectified by searching for all your travel needs on Expedia. For those that need alternative options before committing, give Hotels.com the once over. You just might find the lodging of your dreams.  This year’s big game will be broadcast on ESPN. Don’t have a TV? No worries. You can also stream the game on ESPN+, ESPN.com or the ESPN app.  After the college football season comes to a close, many of the biggest names in music will hit stadiums and arenas all over the country this year.
