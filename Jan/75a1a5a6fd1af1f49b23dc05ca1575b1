A Queens fare-beater pulled a gun and hissed, “I should kill you” to an MTA bus driver — who dared to ask the scofflaw to pay, cops said Sunday. The twisted transit rider, who was wearing a brightly colored hoodie, boarded a Q17 MTA bus at Horace Harding Expressway and Kissena Boulevard around 9:30 p.m.. on Dec. 23 without paying the fare, cops said. The 59-year-old bus driver asked the scofflaw to come over to him, at which point the man began arguing, prompting the operator to ask him to leave the vehicle. As the fare-beater exited the bus, he snarled, “I should kill you” while pointing a firearm at the driver, cops said. “The individual then walked in front of the bus and pointed the firearm at the bus operator again before fleeing to parts unknown,” police said in a news release containing photos of the suspect dressed in a colorful hoodie with letters on it. There were no injuries, cops said. The gunman is described as approximately 5’7″ tall with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a black face mask, black bubble jacket with a light, multicolored hood, black pants and black sneakers.
