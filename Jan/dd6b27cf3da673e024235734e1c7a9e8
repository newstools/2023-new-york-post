House hunters nostalgic for a bygone era of Manhattan might find it in this heavily wood-paneled apartment. A stuck-in-time home has hit the market in the Greenwich Village. The unit — a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo at 60 W. 13th St. — is listed for $1.79 million with Corcoran’s Fred Cargian. In addition to giving an air of it still being in the 1960s, the paneling also makes the 1,135-square-foot abode feel more spacious, Cargian told The Post. They also give it more character than your typical new-construction dwelling. “The maple wall coverings are a nice change from the typical white box apartments,” Cargian said. Other unique features of the apartment include the light-filtering, moveable louvered window coverings found throughout; its spacious entrance with a built-in bar; and the two bedrooms located at the end of the unit, giving them additional privacy and the feeling that they’re in “a separate wing.” The domicile also has a dining nook large enough that it could “be used as an office” — as well as central air and an ensuite dressing room in the primary bedroom, according to the listing. One of the bathrooms features a unique curved vanity, a marbled shelf, tiled walls and a patterned ceiling. The wood floors continue into the narrow galley kitchen and a good deal of the lighting is inset into the paneling. The building — which dates to 1967 — boasts an elevator, a 24-hour doorman, a live-in super, bike storage, a laundry room and a courtyard. A wide brick structure, it’s a short walk from Union Square and across the street from a New School building.
