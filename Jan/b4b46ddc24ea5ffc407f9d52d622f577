Golden Globes host Jerrod Carmichael came under fire Tuesday night for a joke he made about the late Whitney Houston during a rather lackluster awards ceremony. “So, we are here, live, from the hotel that killed Whitney Houston, the Beverly Hilton,” Carmichael, 35, said to a stunned audience. The host then continued his opening monologue in which he said the only reason he was selected as host was because he is black, a not-so-subtle jab at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s highly panned lack of diversity. Houston died in 2012, at age 48, after accidentally drowning in a bathtub at the hotel. A coroner later ruled that heart disease and cocaine played a role in the singer’s death. Twitter users did not wanna dance with Carmichael’s jokes. “Okay that Whitney Houston joke was… yikes. Not good,” tweeted one viewer. “I didn’t like that Whitney Houston joke at all. That was so tasteless and disrespectful to her,” slammed another. “‘The hotel that killed Whitney Houston’?? Pls never hire this guy again. Horrible host,”  wrote a third person. The comedian also took some jabs at other celebrities as well as the anti-Semitic remarks made by Kanye West recently. “I saw [‘The Fabelmans’] with Kanye,” said Carmichael, referencing Steven Spielberg’s film that was up for five awards. “And it changed everything for him. That’s how good you are.”
