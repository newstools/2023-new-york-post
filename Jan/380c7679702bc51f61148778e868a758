Aaron Rodgers isn’t ready to say the word retirement — and a few other words, too. “When you say never, things happen that you say never to,” Rodgers said on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. These “things” could be a 19th season with the Packers, playing elsewhere or calling it a career. Following the end of Green Bay’s season over a week ago, after finishing 8-9 and placing third in the NFC North, Rodgers is dealing with plenty of speculation about his future. He told McAfee he’s not “mentally or emotionally ready” to decide on what’s next. “I just need some time right now. I don’t need to ask anyone to respect my time,” he said. “That’s going to be the answer until I’m ready and when I’m ready to give my opinion like I was last year, I’m either all-in or I’m out.” Does the 39-year-old think he can still compete? Rodgers’ answer left the door open to playing for a team not in Green Bay. “Of course,” he said. “I think I can win MVP again in the right situation. Is that Green Bay or somewhere else, I’m not sure. But I don’t think you should shut down any opportunity.” The veteran quarterback said he never thought he would have played for Green Bay. At the 2005 combine, he had a tough interview with the Packers and doubted he would be drafted by them, as they had the 24th selection in the first round. And here he is, having finished his 18th season with Green Bay and possibly on the brink of another, wherever that may be. “So, be careful saying never,” he added. Rodgers said he received some “washed” sentiments in 2019, when afterward he was voted the league MVP by the Associated Press in 2020 and ’21. He says the sentiment may be the same this year, after hearing some chatter, but he believes he can still compete, especially around “guys you can win with,” such as tight end Marcedes Lewis, and with both sides “wanting to work together moving forward.” Rodgers is due $59.5 million in 2023.
