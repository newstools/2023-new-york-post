Breast believe she’s not ashamed. A woman named Milla on TikTok is gong viral for flaunting her drastically uneven breasts on the video-sharing platform. One recent clip with over 3 million views features Milla in a bikini alongside the caption “big girl.” She happily and shamelessly rocked her green striped swimsuit while inspiring thousands of comments from viewers, many thanking her for “normalizing” her mismatched mammaries. “As someone with one bigger than the other this makes me feel so happy and not alone,” one person wrote. “You’re gorgeous!” Added another, “So happy that people are normalizing one bigger than the other as I’ve got the same and I’ve been so insecure for years so thank you!!!” Breast size and development can be influenced by genetics as well as an excess of estrogen in mammary tissue cells, which can cause one ta-ta to grow more quickly than the other. Breastfeeding is also known to encourage a lopsided chest. TikToker and new mom Bobbi Althoff joked in a video posted last year that in order to help even out her boobs, she stuffed an avocado inside her shirt. “Hope this hack helps you. Always bring some garlic salt just in case,” she captioned the clip. “I refuse to let my inconsistency hold me back from wearing tight tank tops,” Althoff added. “So today, what I’m going to be doing is taking an avocado and sticking it inside to make them look even.” Another social media user, Rebecca Butcher, shared that she only grew one breast and noticed it while going through adolescence. Butcher hoped a doctor could correct her asymmetrical assets — but instead was allegedly told she hadn’t finished puberty yet, and her other boob will appear in time. She eventually learned of her Poland Syndrome diagnosis, a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence of chest wall muscles on one side of the body.
