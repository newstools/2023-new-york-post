A pregnant woman was hit in the leg by a stray bullet while walking on a Bronx street Monday evening, cops and police sources said. The 35-year-old — who is eight months pregnant — was blasted in the left calf around 7:40 p.m. on Grand Concourse near East 192nd Street in Fordham Manor, according to authorities and the sources. She was not the shooter’s intended target, cops said. She was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition, authorities said. The motive for the shooting, and the actual target of the gunfire, were not immediately known. No information was available on a suspect.
