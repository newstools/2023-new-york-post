It’s another loaded night in the National Basketball Association with 10 games spanning from Orlando to Sacramento. No. 1 overall pick Paolo Banchero and the Magic host the Pacers to open the night, followed by the 76ers and Nets duking it out in Brooklyn in a battle of Eastern Conference heavyweights. There are three really good games starting at 8 p.m. ET when the Milwaukee Bucks host the Denver Nuggets in a potential NBA Finals preview, the Minnesota Timberwolves take on the New Orleans Pelicans in the Big Easy, and the Oklahoma City Thunder host the Atlanta Hawks. Things heat up even more out west. The Golden State Warriors host the Memphis Grizzlies, Portland hosts the Utah Jazz, and the upstart Kings face off against the Toronto Raptors in Sacramento.
