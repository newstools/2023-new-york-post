After a nearly perfect start to the season, Kansas was knocked in the teeth last week with two troubling losses — one to a Kansas State team that rarely beats its rival and another to TCU in the Jayhawks’ second-worst home loss (23 points) in Bill Self’s 20-year tenure. It won’t get any easier Monday in an ill-timed road trip to face Baylor. After an 0-3 start in conference play, the Bears have found their rhythm with four straight wins in the loaded Big 12. The driving force has been Baylor’s elite offense, which ranked second in adjusted efficiency after Saturday’s narrow win at Oklahoma. Yet, its defense led the way in that one by holding the Sooners to their sixth-fewest points per possession (0.98) of the season. The Bears have also been virtually unbeatable at home this season, winning eight of 10 games entering Monday’s clash with Kansas. Those two losses came by a combined three points against TCU and Kansas State — the same two teams that handed the Jayhawks their first conference losses and laid the blueprint to exploit Kansas’ passive defense. That’s obviously a concern against Baylor’s elite attack, which helped spark the Bears’ double-digit win over the eventual champions when these teams last met in 2022. This one may not end up entirely that one-sided, but the value is once again on the home team in Monday’s rematch. Baylor -2.5 (BetMGM)
