He’s been holdin’ out so long. Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger joined TikTok Thursday, more than a year after bandmate Keith Richards made his debut on the popular social media app. Jagger’s first TikTok — which is rockin’ 2.4 million views — shows the singer dancing in his studio to the 1968 hit “Sympathy for the Devil” as he welcomes his fans. “Hello, TikTok! We have joined your world,” the 79-year-old legend declares. “So excited to see what you create with our music.” Jagger signs off the 21-second clip with his signature yowl. But some US TikTokers have reported an error message, where the app says the iconic song is “not available” in their country. A TikTok rep told Variety the sound was “unavailable due to a technical glitch, not a rights issue.” The app launched the official hashtag #TheRollingStones to celebrate Jagger’s jump to the platform, inviting users to share their Stones covers and moves like Jagger. The Rolling Stones page already boasts four videos and 59,000 followers, as of Thursday afternoon. Variety noted the band agreed to provide access to their full music catalog on the platform, but do not control their pre-1971 recordings. Those rights are held by Abkco Music & Records, according to the outlet. The band is promising exclusive behind-the-scenes content from shows and recording sessions. TikTokers went wild for Jagger’s app debut. “I hope I have this energy at 79,” one user noted. “Oh my. I didn’t know Mick Jagger was still alive,” another person expressed surprise. “Welcome to TikTok Mick … glad you made the move over here,” chimed in a third.
