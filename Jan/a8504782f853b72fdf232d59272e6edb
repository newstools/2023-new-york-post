Now this is how you celebrate. A short time after the Jaguars completed a comeback for the ages — a 31-30 victory over the Chargers in the wild-card round Saturday in Jacksonville — second-year quarterback Trevor Lawrence swung by a local Waffle House, where he celebrated with his wife, Marissa, and teammates. “So proud of you 16,” Marissa gushed of the 23-year-old Lawrence on her Instagram Story. It was a tale of two halves on Saturday for the Jaguars, who were down 27-7 at the end of the second quarter. Lawrence, who threw four interceptions against the Chargers, rebounded with four touchdowns before Riley Patterson kicked the game-winning field goal. “You couldn’t write a crazier script,” Lawrence said postgame. “We said in the locker room that’s kind of how our season’s going. We’re never out of the fight. … I’m kind of speechless, honestly, just to see what belief can do and to see when a team believes in each other what you can accomplish.” The Jaguars, now the winners of six consecutive games, will advance to next weekend’s divisional round. Their opponent has yet to be determined. It’s been a wild year for Lawrence and the Jaguars, who finished the regular season at 9-8 under first-year head coach Doug Pederson following the failed Urban Meyer experiment. Regardless of what happens next, Lawrence can count on Marissa for her unyielding support. College sweethearts, the couple tied the knot in April 2021, the same month the Jaguars selected Lawrence first-overall in the NFL draft. Ahead of Saturday’s game, Marissa posted a supportive message to Lawrence on Instagram. “It was always 16 #playoffs,” she wrote.
