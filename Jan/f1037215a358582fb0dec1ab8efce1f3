The Fox show “Call Me Kat” is set to welcome a new face on Thursday’s episode — three months after the death of star Leslie Jordan. “30 Rock” alum Jack McBrayer plays Gideon, an Amish man left in charge of the bakery after Jordan’s character moves to Tahiti with his new husband, Entertainment Weekly reports. It’s unclear how long McBrayer will be on the sitcom. The Post reached out to Fox for comment. In a promo clip, Kat (played by Mayim Bialik) is seen introducing the newcomer to her friends in Gideon’s first-ever bar visit. He evidently struggles in social situations, as he is seen ogling Julian Gant’s Carter, the “second black person” Gideon has ever laid eyes on. “Gideon is on a journey of self-discovery,” says Kat. “And as someone who recently went through this myself, I am giddy to be his guide.” Jordan died of cardiac arrest while driving in Los Angeles on Oct. 24. He was 67. Bialik, 47, previously told EW that the thought of doing a funeral episode for Jordan “felt like a hurdle” the crew wasn’t “sure we all wanted to jump together.” So Jordan’s Phil got a warm send-off three weeks ago. “We found a way for him to live forever,” said Bialik, who also serves as an executive producer of the show. “His character will live forever, and he can have whatever adventures we all imagine. And because we break the fourth wall anyway, we were able to use that convention to say simply, we gave this character a happy ending, but there’s a lot more going on here.”
