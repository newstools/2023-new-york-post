Stephen Ross, the Detroit-born founder and chairman of the real-estate development firm Related Companies, who’s also the owner of the Miami Dolphins, has sold his Manhattan penthouse — though not for the price he originally hoped for. Crain’s reports the roughly 8,300-square-foot aerie at the Deutsche Bank Center — formerly known as the Time Warner Center, which Related developed nearly 20 years ago — traded hands for $40 million, according to public sales records. That’s $35 million below the $75 million Ross first wanted for the spread in 2019 — a price that made it among the city’s priciest properties for sale at the time. A spokesperson for Related didn’t immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment on the early January deal. The 25 Columbus Circle home most recently asked $49.9 million, according to listings portal StreetEasy, after its $75 million price tag slipped to $59 million in the summer of 2021 while represented by a different brokerage. In October, the five-bedroom home entered contract. Crain’s adds the buyer is a shell company with the name US No. 9. Ross has since moved to a penthouse at 35 Hudson Yards, which stands in the far West Side megadevelopment that Related also developed — that one opening in March 2019. This just-sold condo looks to 360-degree views of the city — including the expanse of Central Park right in front of the building complex — and beyond. There are five bedrooms, six full bathrooms, a powder room and ceilings more than 11 feet high. The Tony Ingrao- and Randy Kemper-designed unit also includes African bubinga wood flooring, a 22-foot-long dining room with custom moldings and a chef’s kitchen with high-end appliances. Meanwhile, the library has hide-upholstered walls — and an at-home gym faces southwest, looking to views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River. Adam Modlin, of Modlin Group, had the listing.
