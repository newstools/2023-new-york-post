The two hottest teams in the AFC will face off Monday when the Bengals host the Bills in a game with profound playoff implications. And there should be no shortage of fireworks in this Week 17 finale. The Bills’ offense has overcome its midseason woes to come alive over the last six weeks, averaging 28.3 points — fifth-most over that span — amid a six-game winning streak entering Monday. Preseason MVP favorite Josh Allen has finally looked the part after a shaky stretch in early November, tossing 12 touchdowns to just three interceptions over his last six starts to carry Buffalo’s elite scoring attack. Tonight’s highly entertaining matchup will kick off at 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC Conversely, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow has entered the MVP conversation in the 11th hour with his stellar play of late. The former No. 1 pick threw for 375 yards and three touchdowns in last week’s 22-18 win over the Patriots, capping off a seven-game win streak during which Cincinnati has scored 29.3 points per game — third-most by any team since Nov. 1. Those aerial attacks should be able to put up points on Monday against these opposing defenses, which are solid overall but beatable through the air. The Bills’ defense ranks third in overall DVOA but seventh against the pass and 15th in opposing passing yards per game (213.3); the Bengals rank 21st in such yards allowed (225.9) and a mediocre 14th in pass defense DVOA. These two quarterbacks are dangerous in any spot, but with Monday’s matchups leaning in their favor? Get ready for a barn-burner. THE PLAY: Bills-Bengals Over 49.5 (BetMGM)
