Dak Prescott thinks questions about Mike McCarthy’s job status are “comical.” The Cowboys’ quarterback spoke to reporters on Friday before the team travels to Tampa to play Tom Brady and the Buccaneers on Monday night, and defended his head coach’s performance. “It’s comical in a sense,” Prescott said, as covered by ESPN’s Todd Archer. “First, what back to back 12 wins [seasons] in y’all tell me how long and we’re talking about a guy’s job in jeopardy? That shows you when you play for this organization what comes with it and that’s why it’s important to create these walls around us, create this safe place in our locker room and understanding what matters is the men that go out there and get in between the lines and put the work in throughout the week for us to go out and win.” As Prescott alluded to, Dallas has piled up back-to-back 12-5 regular seasons. However, they have not yet won a playoff game under McCarthy. Last season, they were upset at home, 23-17, by the 49ers in a game where Prescott did not appear to have a firm grasp of the clock implications at the end. During this past offseason, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones issued a warning that they’d better advance in the playoffs. “Well, I need to win [another Super Bowl]. I need to win it, but I’ll be candid with you, there’s degrees,” Jones said this past July. “I want to be fair to everybody concerned. We need to be in the playoffs. We need to be viable in the playoffs for it to be a successful season.” Nevertheless, earlier this week Jones was adamant that McCarthy’s job is not at stake. “No. I don’t even want to … No. That’s it,” Jones said. “I don’t need to go into all the pluses or minuses. I’ve got a lot more to evaluate Mike McCarthy on than this playoff game.” One matter that hangs over McCarthy’s head is Sean Payton, who previously worked in the Cowboys organization, is known to have a close relationship with Jones and is looking to get back into football.
