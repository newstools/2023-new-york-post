Elderly consumers are taking a bite out of Apple’s education services. A photo what appears to be an in-store iPhone tutorial for seniors went viral on Saturday after comedian Solé shared it to Twitter. “Nah apple dead got a class on how to use ya iPhone for old people,” reads the photo’s caption. The photo has since gained nearly 24 million views. According to a study released by the Pew Research Center in January 2022, 61% of adults 65 and older now own a smartphone. While they don’t specifically mention age, Apple runs a 60-minute course on how to use an iPhone, according to their website. “You’ll learn how to navigate your device and customize your settings, and we’ll take you through the latest apps and features. Recommended for those new to iPhone,” reads the course description. Twitter users found the photo incredibly endearing. “My granddad did this a couple times. He knew EVERYTHING about that phone,” wrote one user. “He was a jazz musician, born in the 20s, played with the greats, and before he died, he was using Skype to play drums with his former bandmate in Europe. Jamming across continents in his living room.” “Love that this is a thing,” said “Teen Wolf” actor Stephen Ford. “This is so wholesome,” a fourth person said. “That’s so cute! LOW KEY THATS GONNA BE ALL OF US with something one day,” said a third person.
