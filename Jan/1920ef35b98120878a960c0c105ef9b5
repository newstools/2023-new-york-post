“Stranger Things” actor Noah Schnapp has come out as gay. The 18-year-old Netflix star addressed his own sexuality in an eight-second TikTok on Thursday that racked up over 3 million views in less than an hour. “I guess I’m more similar to Will than I thought,” he captioned the video, referring to his gay “Stranger Things” character Will Byers. He mouthed along to audio in the clip of a female voice, saying, “You know what it never was? That serious … Quite frankly, will never be that serious.” “When I finally told my friends and family I was gay after being scared in the closet for 18 years and all they said was ‘we know,’” Schnapp added in text over the video. The Post has reached out to representatives for Schnapp for comment. More than 64,000 fans quickly ran to the comments, many of whom congratulated Schnapp on “being your true self!” “NOAH IM SO PROUD,” one proclaimed. “I KNEW IT,” another claimed. “This is the most iconic coming out ever,” one other person added. Schnapp previously left Will’s sexuality up to viewers’ interpretation but confirmed in a 2022 interview with Variety that his character was gay and in love with his best friend, Mike Wheeler (played Finn Wolfhard). “Obviously, it was hinted at in Season 1,” he said of Will’s gradual comfortability. “It was always kind of there, but you never really knew, is it just him growing up slower than his friends? Now that he’s gotten older, they made it a very real, obvious thing. “Now it’s 100% clear that he is gay and he does love Mike,” Schnapp continued. “But before, it was a slow arc. I think it is done so beautifully because it’s so easy to make a character just, like, all of a sudden be gay.”
