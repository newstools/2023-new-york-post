Luciana Brandt, 41, said she never expected to be pregnant again after giving birth to five children over two decades. Doctors reportedly told her she had started menopause early — and she no longer had many eggs to conceive a baby. And yet, Brandt gave birth to a daughter weighing a whopping 11.1 pounds Tuesday, Jam Press reported. “I am very happy about her arrival, but I never imagined she would weigh over five kilograms!” the Brazilian mother of six marveled to local media. “Super baby” Maria Vitória Brandt, who was born at 40 weeks, reportedly measured 20 inches long after arriving via Caesarean section. The beaming new mom was discharged Thursday from Hospital Maicé, in the municipality of Caçador, Santa Catarina State, per Jam Press. The hospital said babies born there typically weigh between 6 and 8 pounds, so Maria’s size and weight is considered quite unusual. The facility shared images of the newborn along with a touching message for her family. “Hospital Maicé wishes good health and happiness to little Maria Vitória and her family and that they receive many blessings,” a hospital spokesperson said. Luciana’s eldest daughter, Ângela Brandt, 23, traveled a long distance to be by her mother’s side and help welcome baby Maria into the world. Dr. Juscelino Euler Oliveira performed the delivery under the care of pediatrician Dr. Priscilla Ramos, Jam Press noted. “Knowing I had little chance of getting pregnant again, I kept faith, and God wanted it too,” Luciana revealed. Maria wore a pink patterned outfit and a yellow bejeweled ice cream onesie in photos taken after her birth. One mom recently noted on TikTok that she, too, was not expecting her daughter to be born so big, and the clothes she packed for the hospital were too small. “My chunk going straight to size 2 and 0-3 month clothes…,” she wrote on her viral video, which was accompanied by a crying-laughing emoji.
