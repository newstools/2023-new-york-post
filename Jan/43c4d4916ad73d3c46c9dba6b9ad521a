Aaron Rodgers appears to be enjoying a “low-key” romance with Mallory Edens, the 26-year-old daughter of Bucks owner Wes Edens. The duo, who has sat courtside together in Milwaukee over the years, is said to be “more than friends,” a source told People, who added, “but it’s casual.” “Nothing serious at all,” the insider continued, noting that Rodgers, 39, is “not looking to rush into anything.” “It’s low-key for now,” the source said. Rumors of an apparent relationship between Rodgers and Edens have been circulating in recent weeks. Not only did a tipster allege to the celebrity-focused Instagram account, DeuxMoi, that they shopped for a Christmas tree together, but an insider relayed to Sports Gossip how their friendship evolved romantically. “But it’s definitely a very close friendship that is evolving,” the source told People. “He’s not going to do something as quick as Shailene [Woodley]. Live and learn.” Edens, who is also a model, was seen sporting Packers gear at a recent game in a photo obtained by Sports Gossip. Prior to Edens, Rodgers — who wrapped his 18th NFL season on Sunday with a 20-16 loss to the Lions — was linked to podcaster “Blu of Earth.” He was also engaged to Woodley, who starred on “Big Little Lies.” The twosome called it quits in April 2022 following a brief reconciliation earlier in the year. “Shailene tried to give it another shot and was spending time with Aaron,” a source told E! News at the time. “But she quickly saw that everything was on his terms and nothing was going to change. There was no reason to continue and she’s done with it again.” In addition to Woodley, 31, Rodgers was in high-profile relationships with actress Olivia Munn and former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick. He split from Munn, 42, in April 2017 after three years together and dated Patrick, 40, for two years before parting ways in July 2020.
