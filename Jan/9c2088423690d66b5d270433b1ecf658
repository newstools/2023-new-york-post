The Mets’ reshuffled coaching staff is on the verge of completion. Former player Eric Hinske is expected to become the assistant hitting coach, according to a club source, following a shakeup this offseason that left the job vacant. Eric Chavez moved from hitting coach to bench coach and Jeremy Barnes was promoted to Chavez’s old job after spending last season as the assistant hitting coach. Former bench coach Glenn Sherlock is now the Mets’ catching instructor. The Athletic first reported Hinske’s expected hiring. Hinske, 45, previously worked as hitting coach under current Mets general manager Billy Eppler when the two were together with the Angels. The Mets like Barnes — and promoted him to hitting coach out of fear another organization would poach him — for his analytical approach. Hinske will bring the experience of a former player who spent 12 seasons in the major leagues and received World Series championship rings with the Red Sox and Yankees. In addition, Hinske was a coach with the Cubs when they won the World Series in 2016.
