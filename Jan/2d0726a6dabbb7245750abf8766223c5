A young woman was killed in a hit-and-run crash after her rideshare driver left her on the side of a Colorado interstate early New Year’s Day, police said. The woman and her friends had gotten out of the car on the side of Northbound I-25 about 11 miles north of Denver after she “became ill in the vehicle” just past midnight Sunday, according to Thorton police. The unidentified woman, only described as in her 20s, then “walked out into the roadway and was sideswiped by a dark truck that never stopped but continued driving” on the highway, where the speed limit is 65 mph, police said. The woman collapsed and was struck by a second car, which stopped and remained at the scene. On Monday, 33-year-old Adam Wooley of nearby Fredrick, Colo., turned himself in as the hit-and-run driver, authorities said. He was charged with a hit-and-run involving death, and his truck was impounded. It is not likely the rideshare driver will face criminal charges, Thornton police Officer Jesus Mendez told the Denver Post. “I do know that is not the cause of the accident,” he said. “It’s not that a vehicle ran off the side of the road and struck them. This person walked out into the roadway and was struck.”
