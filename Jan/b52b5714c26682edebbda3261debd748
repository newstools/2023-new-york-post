DeMeco Ryans is going back to where his NFL journey began. The Houston Texans have hired the 38-year-old Ryans as their new head coach, the team announced. Ryans, who spent the last six seasons on the 49ers coaching staff, including the last two as defensive coordinator, agreed to a six-year contract with Houston, per ESPN. “For so many reasons, DeMeco is everything we are looking for in a leader and coach for our organization,” Texans owner Cal McNair said in a statement. “He has a proven track record for developing high-quality players and constantly innovated his defensive scheme over the last six seasons in San Francisco.” Ryans was drafted by the Texans out of Alabama in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. He earned Defensive Rookie of the Year honors and made two Pro Bowls during his six seasons with the Texans, who traded him to the Eagles in 2012. He played four seasons in Philadelphia before he was released in 2016 and joined the 49ers as a defensive quality control coach in 2017. The 49ers had the best defense in the NFL this season in terms of yards per game (300.6) and points per game (16.3). San Francisco allowed the third-fewest yards per game (310) during the 2021 season while allowing 21.5 points per game. The Texans fired Lovie Smith after just one season after going 3-13-1 during the 2022 season. That came after Houston made David Culley a one-and-done coach after he went 4-13 in 2021.
