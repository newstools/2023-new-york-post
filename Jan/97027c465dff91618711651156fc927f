“Rumour Has It” Adele and Sam Smith might be one and the same. Smith — who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns — confessed to Drew Barrymore, 47, that the craziest rumor they’ve ever heard about themselves is that they are secretly Adele in drag. “Everyone seems to think that I’m Adele in drag,” the 30-year-old singer said on “The Drew Barrymore Show.” “’Cause we’ve never been seen in the same room together, and if you slow down her voice, it sounds maybe a bit like mine. So people think that we’re the same person, and I’m just in drag right now,” they continued. The conspiracy theory that Smith and Adele, 34, are the same person seems to have started circulating the internet in 2018 when one person posted a video of Adele’s music slowed down, which ended up sounding like Smith. “Did you know that when you slow down Adele it’s actually Sam Smith,” the user tweeted along with video “evidence.” Around the same time, another user pointed out that Adele didn’t attend the 2018 Grammys, where Sam Smith performed. “Anyone notice that Adele isn’t at the Grammys this year? It’s because Adele and Sam Smith are the same person and you’ll never see them both in the same place at the same time,” the person tweeted. Other fans weren’t so sure about the rumors. “Nobody ever, in their wildest fever dream, while drunk and high on opioids has EVER said Sam Smith is Adele in drag,” one person said. “The VOICE? For sure pitched sounds like it. But physically? Even a blind man wouldn’t make that mistake.” “One thing is ‘hey, they sound similar!’ and another one is ‘Adele is Sam Smith in drag!’ Not quite the same,” another tweeted. “I want Adele’s reaction to what Sam smith said,” someone joked. While Adele and Smith are both London-born singers, that’s about the extent of their similarities. Smith’s album “Gloria” will be released on Jan. 27.
