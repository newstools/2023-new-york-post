A foul should have been called on a potential game-winning shot from LeBron James during the Dallas Mavericks’ 119-115 double-overtime victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night, according to the NBA’s Last Two Minute Report. With the game tied and time running out during the first overtime, James drove to the hoop for a game-winning layup that was blocked by Mavericks big man Christian Wood. The referees swallowed their whistles, but the report showed that James should have been sent to the free throw line. Dallas would go on to win in the second overtime behind 35 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Luka Doncic, who hit a pair of clutch 3-pointers, one with six seconds left in regulation and again with 47.8 seconds to go in the first OT. The NBA also determined that Lakers wing Troy Brown Jr. wasn’t fouled by Tim Hardaway Jr. as he contested his potential game-winning 3-pointer as time expired in regulation, despite complaints from Brown Jr., James and head coach Darvin Ham after the game. “No, it’s a f–king foul,” James said of the non-call on Brown Jr. in the locker room after the game, according to a report from ESPN. “It’s a foul. No matter what [Brown] says, it’s a f–king foul. That s–t is blatant, and they should have called it.” The Lakers weren’t the only team upset with the officiating Thursday. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban took to Twitter, calling the game the “worst officiated game.” The loss dropped the Lakers to 19-23 and 13th place in the Western Conference standings.
