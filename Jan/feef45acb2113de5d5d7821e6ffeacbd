Jennifer Coolidge had a funny flub during the 2023 Golden Globe Awards on Tuesday — after saying she was nervous to present at the awards ceremony. The “White Lotus” icon, 61, gave the award for best supporting actor in a TV musical/comedy or drama to “Abbott Elementary” star Tyler James Williams. As she handed him the coveted award, she mistakenly called the Globe, the “Oscar.” Cue the laughter from the audience and a viral moment has been cemented in Hollywood history forever. Before her mistake, Coolidge explained how she was asked to present at the awards show. She said she received a phone call from someone affiliated with the show. “I said, ‘Oh my god, that is such an honor. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yes, I would love to.’ And I hung up on her. And then I thought about it for a little bit, and I just had a complete anxiety attack,” the “A Cinderella Story” star said before presenting the award. She then joked about how the floors of the Globes stage were overly waxed. Coolidge quipped how it was suggested she “wear a pair of Crocs.” “And I said, ‘What, are you kidding me? With my Dolce & Gabbana dress, you know, all those crazy Italians would lose their minds!'” she said. To add to her nervousness, Coolidge told the audience that her “biggest nightmare … really is just the pronunciation of people’s names. I can’t do it.” She continued: “You know, once I say someone’s name the wrong way, I’m screwed. I can’t do it. Like you hear it that one way, and you can’t undo it.” Coolidge then went into a long rant about how she had trouble pronouncing Bill Nye’s name at a dinner party one evening. “But you know what? I’m feeling pretty good right now because I haven’t screwed up yet,” she added. “So I guess I can do this.”
