Veteran British actress Sylvia Syms has died at age 89. Syms rose to fame in the late 1950s, with a breakout role in the war movie “Ice Cold in Alex” and then appearances in notable British TV shows and films “No Trees in the Street,” “Doctor Who,” “Peak Practice,” “EastEnders” and the 1960s Roger Moore series “The Saint.” Syms gained global recognition for her roles as formidable UK figures, most notably former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in “Thatcher: The Final Days” and the Queen Mother Elizabeth I in the 2006 royals biopic “The Queen,” opposite Oscar winner Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II. Syms last appeared on screen in a guest role on the BBC/HBO period drama “Gentleman Jack” in 2019. The actress was also known for her charity work, and was given the title of OBE — which names you an officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire — by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2007. Syms attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where she received the Gerald Lawrence Scholarship and an HM Tenants Award and was propelled to a successful career that spanned more than six decades after graduating. Her family told Sky News that she “died peacefully” early Friday at Denville Hall, a care home in London for those in the entertainment industry. “She has lived an amazing life and gave us joy and laughter right up to the end,” her children, Beatie and Ben Edney, said in a statement to the outlet. “Just yesterday we were reminiscing together about all our adventures. She will be so very missed,” the statement continued. “We would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Denville Hall for the truly excellent care they have taken of our mum over the past year.”
