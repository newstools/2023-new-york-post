Nate Colbert, who hit more home runs than anyone in San Diego Padres history, died at 76, the team announced Thursday. A cause of death was not given. Colbert, an original member of the Padres, smashed 163 home runs with the team from 1969-74. “Nate was devoted to his community off the field as well, dedicating his time to disadvantaged youth through his ministry,” Padres Chairman Peter Seidler said in a statement. “He was a magnetic person who will be dearly missed.” The first baseman played briefly with the Astros before being selected by the Padres in the expansion draft. He was an All-Star from 1971-73 and finished eighth in the 1972 NL MVP voting. In 1972, Colbert became the second player in major league history to hit five home runs during a doubleheader. He also tallied 13 RBI in the historic outing against the Braves. Back injuries slowed down his 10-year career, in which he later played briefly for the Tigers, Expos and A’s before retiring after 1976. In 1999, the Padres inducted the Missouri native into the team’s inaugural Hall of Fame class. The slugger made his return to San Diego to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before a Padres game in August 2021.
