Two men were stabbed multiple times in New York City on Monday morning by an attacker who jumped out of a passing SUV, cops said. The victims, ages 29 and 27, were walking on Second Avenue near 105th Street in East Harlem around 12:30 a.m. when a man jumped out of a white SUV and began stabbing them, police said. The attacker then fled on foot, leaving the vehicle behind. A person of interest was taken into custody at the scene and police were searching for a second suspect, cops said. The older man was stabbed in the neck and taken to Harlem Hospital. The younger man was stabbed in the back and slashed in the ear and taken to Cornell Hospital, according to police. Both were expected to survive, cops said. The motive for the attack wasn’t immediately clear, police said. It wasn’t clear if the men knew their attacker. “One of the victims lived in the neighborhood,” a police spokesperson said. The second suspect was described as being thin, having long braids and wearing all black clothing, police sources said.
