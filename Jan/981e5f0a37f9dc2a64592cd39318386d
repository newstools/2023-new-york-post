It was doing the sirloin shake. Social media users are pledging to convert to veganism over a viral video showing freshly cut meat “twerking” after being salted. The video of the pulsating protein first went viral on Twitter in 2020, but recently resurfaced on the platform, where it “grossed out” over 121,000 views. “Adding salt to freshly cut muscle causes it to spasm,” reads the caption to the gyrating steak footage, which was reposted by the Twitter account “Weird and Terrifying.” In the nightmare-inducing clip, an unnamed butcher can be holding up a piece of raw beef as it spasms like a piece of live fish sashimi. According to Scientific American, this beef zombification occurs when the nerve endings in freshly cut meat are activated by sodium ions, which causes the muscles to contract. Chinese meat inspector Lv Suwen explained the phenomenon like this in a 2015 article: “The central nervous system is dead but the nerve-endings in the muscles are still firing resulting in the jumping, because the nerves are not yet dead. This will stop after a short time.” While this ribeye reanimation may seem revolting, it’s actually an indicator of high-quality meat. “You can rest assured, this piece of meat is very fresh and is from a freshly slaughtered animal,” Suwen declared. Nonetheless, viewers were revolted by the spectacle with one aghast gawker calling the dancing beef “the least appetizing thing I’ve ever seen.” “Uh … maybe I’ll have a salad instead,” said another, while one horrified viewer declared, “I ain’t eating meat again.” “No longer using recipes I find in the Necronomicon,” joked one Twitter wit, referencing the flesh-bound reanimation bible from the “Evil Dead” films. This isn’t the first video of meat moving post-mortem. In a revolting 2019 clip, a piece of raw chicken sashimi appeared to come to life and crawl off a restaurant table like a face-hugger from “Alien.”
