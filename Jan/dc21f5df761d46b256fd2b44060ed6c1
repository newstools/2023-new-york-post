Carlos Correa’s dramatic offseason is officially coming to a close. The All-Star shortstop has passed his physical with the Twins and the team announced the re-signing of the 28-year-old on Wednesday. It comes a day after the two sides agreed to a six-year, $200 million contract with the potential for another $70 million over four vesting years. Correa, who spent 2022 with the Twins and opted out after the first year of a three-year, $105.3 million deal, had agreed to a 12-year, $315 million contract with the Mets in the wee hours of Dec. 21 after his 13-year, $350 million deal with the Giants fell apart due to concerns over the shortstop’s surgically repaired right ankle. “Wow what a journey it’s been. A lot of emotions involved throughout the whole process but always believed that at the end of the day God will put me in the right place,” Correa wrote in an Instagram post. The Mets were also concerned about the ankle, injured in the minors in 2014, after conducting a physical, and according to The Post’s Mike Puma and Jon Heyman, the team tried to get contract language protection in case the ankle would keep Correa from playing. The Mets were then willing to guarantee $157.5 million over six years, and he would’ve been eligible for an additional six years and $157.5 million had he reached plate-appearance and innings benchmarks. Mets owner Steve Cohen was elated when he struck a deal with Correa’s agent Scott Boras while Cohen and his wife were in Hawaii. “We needed one more thing, and this is it,” Cohen told The Post’s Heyman at the time “This was important … This puts us over the top. This is a good team. I hope it’s a good team!” Correa, who played seven seasons with the Astros and was a part of Houston’s scandal-scarred 2017 World Series team, has never missed time due to his right ankle. He hit .291 with an .834 OPS, 22 home runs and 64 RBIs in 136 games for the Twins last season.
