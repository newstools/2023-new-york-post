She’s a boss lady. In a new Instagram post shared this weekend, dancer and internet star JoJo Siwa, 19, celebrated the two-year anniversary of her coming out of the closet as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. The former “Dance Moms” star took to the platform to share a throwback photo of herself wearing a shirt that read, “Best. Gay. Cousin. Ever.,” which she used for her initial announcement in 2021. “2 years ago today ,” Siwa wrote in the caption of the photo posted Saturday. “Now looking back on everything…. I’m SO proud of 17 year old JoJo.” In the comments section, some celebs left her messages of support, like her former “Dancing With The Stars” partner, Jenna Johnson Chmerkovskiy. The duo made history as the first same-sex pair to compete together on the hit show. After Siwa came out in 2021, she debuted her relationship with then-girlfriend Kylie Prew. However, the two split for good last August. The star then began dating TikToker Avery Cyrus for three months. That relationship ended this past December. She has since been linked to TikTok model Savannah Demers, according to The Daily Mail. While speaking to People in an interview in April 2021, Siwa admitted that she had felt this way about her sexuality since she was younger. “I’ve known since I was little,” Siwa told the outlet at the time, adding,  “I have a lot that could have gone away because of my love life.” However, Siwa doesn’t like to put a label on things, and said that she was “pansexual,” which means that you are attracted to the person, not their gender or sexual identity. “I like queer,” she told People. “Technically I would say that I am pansexual because that’s how I have always been my whole life is just like, my human is my human.” Since the “J Team” star has shared her identity with the world, she has spoken about it on her social media platforms, like TikTok, and continues to advocate for the community.
