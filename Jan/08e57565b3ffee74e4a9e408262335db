The new year got off to a bloody start Sunday after a man was stabbed to death during a fight over a parking spot in the Bronx — marking the first homicide of 2023, according to police. The victim was identified by sources as Sergio Garcia, 63. He was stabbed along with a 38-year-old woman in front of a building on College Avenue near East 170th Street in Claremont Village shortly before 4 a.m., cops said. “They were involved in an altercation with an unknown group over parking,” a law enforcement source told The Post. “This guy got killed over a parking spot.” The wounded pair showed up at Bronx Lebanon Hospital, with Garcia pronounced dead and the woman listed in stable condition, cops said. There were no arrests. Police data shows that as of Christmas day there were 418 murders in the five boroughs during 2022, down from 481 over the same period last year. The fatal stabbing wasn’t the only early bloodshed of the year, cops said. A man was stabbed in the stomach at East 21st Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan’s Flatiron District at around 2:30 a.m., police said. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. The suspect, who was wearing a yellow jacket and gray jeans, fled on 21st Street on foot, cops said. There was no known motive.
