Sebastian Cwilich is a veteran of the art world — but now he’s making a diversion into the literary world. The former Christie’s auction house executive and Artsy co-founder is helping book lovers find the perfect next read with his new app Tertulia. “We saw a need,” Cwilich told the Post. “In a world full of rich discovery services for movies, music, television, fine art, concerts, and sports, there is no equivalent for books. Our aim is to help readers discover books and decide what to read next.” The sleek app provides a much-needed — and hugely upgraded — alternative to Amazon for those in the market for a new read. It’s not an all-purpose marketplace — rather, it’s a curated space for bookworms. Tertulia compiles book reviews, author interviews, broadcast mentions, podcasts, social media buzz, and prizes won by a book all into one place. It also provides an integrated in-app way to purchase the book, making it a true one-stop-shop. The app’s name is inspired by tertulias in Spain, which are informal gatherings at bars or cafes where people chat about current affairs and the books they are reading. Now, the app is creating a digital space to do the same. “Tertulia is a delightful walled garden of book conversations,” said Cwilich. “Whether a book has been mentioned by a top media publication, a chef, a writer, an actor, a book critic, or a historian, you’ll find it — and can buy it — on Tertulia.” Now, Cwilich is calling all those looking for a New Year’s read to try his app: “We’re marrying the delight of serendipitous discovery with the convenience of streamlined e-commerce check-out and delivery — along with features like book tracking, exclusive content, and more.”
