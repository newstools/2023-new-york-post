The wife of late ABC producer Dax Tejera was busted hours after his fatal heart attack — for allegedly endangering their two little girls at a posh Manhattan hotel, an NYPD spokesman said Monday. Tejera, 37, a producer for “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” died Dec. 23, and cops was called to The Yale Club at 50 Vanderbilt Ave. later that night over a report of unattended children, police said. A preliminary investigation “revealed that a 2-year-old female and a 5-month-old female were left alone inside of a hotel room for an extended period of time,” police said. Their mother, Dax’s widow Veronica Tejera, was  later charged with two counts of “acting in a manner injurious to a child,” according to police. Veronica was hit with a desk-appearance ticket and will have to appear in criminal court at a future date. Dax Tejera was an executive producer on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” His death was announced in an internal e-mail at ABC News on Dec. 24 by division President Kim Godwin, who noted his “energy, passion and love” for his work, according to reports. Veronica Tejera did not immediately return a phone message from The Post on Monday.
