It was a memorial fit for a Princess. Austin Butler and model Kaia Gerber were spotted Sunday at the memorial service for Lisa Marie Presley who passed away earlier this month, reports People. The “Elvis” star — who attended the 2023 Golden Globes with the family — sat behind grieving Presley kin while director Baz Luhrmann, his wife, and the film’s costume designer sat next to them. Butler, 31, gave Presley’s 14-year-old daughter Finley a hug minutes before the Graceland memorial started. Priscilla Presley alongside Riley Keough, Axl Rose, Sarah Ferguson — the ex-wife of the disgraced Prince Andrew — and several other celebrities celebrated the life of the King of Rock and Roll’s daughter. “I am eternally grateful for the time I was lucky enough to be near her bright light and will forever cherish the quiet moments we shared,” shared Butler in a statement to People. “Her warmth, her love and her authenticity will always be remembered.” Presley’s death is still under investigation according to the Los Angeles County coroner. “Presley was examined on Jan. 14 and the cause of death was deferred,” said a spokesperson for the LA County Dept. of Medical Examiner-Coroner to CNN. “Deferred means that after an autopsy, a cause of death has not been determined and the medical examiner is requesting more investigation into the death, including additional studies. Once the tests/studies come back, the doctor evaluates the case again and makes the cause of death determination.” Preliminary reports suggest that the 54-year-old suffered cardiac arrest at her Calabasas home. The Presley family also allegedly suffers from a history of heart problems.
