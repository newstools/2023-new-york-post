The flood of fentanyl into New York City “will destroy generations” to come if it isn’t stopped, Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday, sounding the alarm about the deadly synthetic opioid. “Do you remember what heroin did to our city and country? Do you remember what crack cocaine did to our city and country? That’s what fentanyl is about to do right now,” Adams said as part of a startling warning during his State of the City speech. “This is a major crisis that we are sleeping on. Fentanyl is destroying our cities across America. We have to fight back and stop,” he added as part of the last-minute addition to the address. Adams said he plans to invest $150 million into “proven harm reduction and treatment programs.” The mayor credited New York Attorney General Letitia James with making the investment possible through settlement money obtained by the state in its lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic. Drug overdoses have soared in New York City over the past few years as fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than morphine, has become integrated into the illicit drug market. More than 2,800 people died of a fatal overdose over a 12-month span ending in July 2022 — with roughly four out of five of those caused by fentanyl. NYC Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan previously told The Post the wave of the synthetic drug into the city is much worse than the crack epidemic. Six out of 10 fake prescription pills seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration across the US last year were found to have a fatal amount of fentanyl.
