The retrenchment and space-shedding wave that’s swamping financial and tech firms hasn’t struck Two Sigma yet. The technology-driven hedge fund — which employs AI as part of its trading strategy — quietly renewed on 260,000 square feet for seven more years at 100 Sixth Ave., we’ve learned. The firm also has over 100,000 square feet at 101 Sixth Ave. next door. No one involved would comment. Our source said the asking rent was $80 per square foot. The owners of 100 Sixth are a joint venture of Trinity Real Estate, Norges Bank Investment Management and operating partner Hines. We’re told that Cushman & Wakefield’s Peter Trivelas and Chris Helgesen represented Two Sigma, while Newmark’s David Falk and Peter Shimkin acted for the ownership.
