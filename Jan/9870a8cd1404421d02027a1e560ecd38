Steve Tisch made a surprise statement after the Giants’ wild-card win over the Vikings. The Giants co-owner, who is normally in the background while other co-owner John Mara acts as the franchise’s public spokesperson, rarely makes comments about his team. But after Big Blue’s first playoff win in over a decade, a 31-24 victory over the Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium, Tisch went forth to talk about how “proud” he is of the Giants. “My family and I are proud of the players, coaches and staff and how everyone throughout the entire organization has worked together to make this a successful season,” Tisch said. “We are happy for the Giants fans who have endured some tough times with us in recent years. We appreciate their support, passion and enthusiasm. “Joe [Schoen] and [Brian Daboll] have laid the foundation for continued success. We all agree there is much work left to be done. Their shared vision and constant dialogue is always about what is best for the organization, as is their consistent approach day in and day out and the great communication with John [Mara] and me.” Tisch, a film producer whose dad Bob used to co-own the Giants, also acts as a chairman and executive vice president for Big Blue – positions he took on back in 2005. The 73-year-old co-owner, along with Mara, were instrumental in the Giants’ revival this season by deciding to fire former head coach Joe Judge in 2021. The leadership call eventually paved the way for the current head coach, Daboll, to quickly rebuild Big Blue. With the Giants punching their ticket to the next round, they will face the Eagles next weekend at Lincoln Financial Field.
