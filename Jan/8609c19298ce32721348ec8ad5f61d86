A Florida woman has been arrested for luring a man into a violent ambush after promising him “sexual favors,” according to a report. Gracie Lemke, 20, reached out to the unidentified victim on Facebook Messenger and pledged to perform sex acts on him this past weekend, according to the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office. The duped mark agreed to meet Lemke in nearby Adamsville and arrived by car, the Villages News reported. As he exited his vehicle, Joshua Timmons, 24, suddenly appeared and held the man at bay, while Lemke and another accomplice, Lauren Locher, rummaged through his SUV for valuables, police said. The victim then managed to wrestle himself away from Timmons and ran down the road, according to police. Timmons is then said to have pulled out a gun and shot him once in the back, with the bullet exiting out of his abdomen. As he writhed on the road, the treacherous trio hopped in his 2008 Chevrolet Blazer and sped off towards a home where Timmons and Lemke were living. Cops soon arrived at the residence and spotted Timmons trying to burn his clothes in an attempt to destroy evidence from the ambush. A search warrant also turned up a bloody knife, 55 grams of pot and drug paraphernalia, according to police. All three suspects were placed into custody, with Timmons facing attempted murder charges and his female associates burglary raps. The victim underwent emergency surgery and remains in critical condition.
