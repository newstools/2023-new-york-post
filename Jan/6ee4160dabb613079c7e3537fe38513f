An infant twin who was found after a kidnapping in Ohio last month has died, according to a report. Little Kyair Thomass died just before midnight Saturday after emergency services received a call of a baby not breathing at a Columbus home, according to a report by NBC, citing local police. The baby was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Kyair and his twin brother, Kason, were abducted Dec. 19 when Nalah Jackson stole the car they were in while their mother, Wilhelmina, ran into a restaurant to pick up a DoorDash delivery order, cops said at the time. Kyair was found abandoned hours later near the Dayton International Airport, while Kason was discovered three days later, on Dec. 22, in Indianapolis near a Papa John’s pizza shop the same Honda Accord that the infant pair were kidnapped in. In a stroke of luck, two Indianapolis cops who had been taking a break to eat during their search for Kason stumbled upon the stolen car and the baby outside the restaurant. The Thomass family called the recovery of the babies a “miracle” at the time. The little boys’ grandmother, LaFonda Thomass, said, “it’s going to be the best Christmas ever,” according to an interview with WBNS-TV. Jackson was arrested the same day that Kason was recovered and charged with two counts of kidnapping.
