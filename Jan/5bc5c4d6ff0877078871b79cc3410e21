A Georgia woman has been arrested for a horrific New York subway attack in which she allegedly burned a woman with a chemical, police said. Rodlin Gravesande, 33, is accused of the twisted, unprovoked Dec. 2 assault, in which she started arguing with the victim on the southbound platform at the Nostrand Avenue and Winthrop Street subway station — the 2/5 lines — in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens at around 1:10 a.m., cops said. Gravesande allegedly began following the 21-year-old up the stairs and then “splashed an unknown chemical substance” on the woman’s face, authorities said. The unhinged assailant ran off while the victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center with first-and second-degree burns to her face, police said. A Fulton County SWAT team arrested the suspect for the Brooklyn subway attack Jan. 3, the Fulton County Sheriff’s office announced. The team arrested Gravesande without incident at a home in southwest Atlanta where she was visiting, Fulton County law enforcers said. Gravesande was booked in Brooklyn on Friday and charged with assault, the NYPD announced Saturday. There was no connection between Gravesande and the victim, who was reportedly on her way to work, and the attack appears to have been unprovoked, authorities said.
