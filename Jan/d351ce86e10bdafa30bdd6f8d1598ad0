Trevor Lawrence’s wife, Marissa, is ready to cheer on the Jaguars in the postseason. Moments after the Jaguars topped the Titans on Saturday, 20-16, and clinched the AFC South, Marissa took to her Instagram Stories to celebrate. “Playoffs here we come!” Marissa posted from TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, where she watched the game with Ozzy Ozkan and Jazmyn Jones, the significant others of Jaguars players Christian Kirk and Marvin Jones Jr., respectively. Lawrence, who is in his second season as the Jaguars’ quarterback, completed 20 of 32 passing attempts for 212 yards, one touchdown and zero interceptions in the victory. An elated Lawrence, 23, reacted to clinching his first-ever playoff berth postgame. “It’s hard to sum up this season and what we’ve been able to do. To get an opportunity to go play in the playoffs. Another home game here. We’re fired up,” Lawrence said, per NFL.com. It’s been quite the year for Lawrence, the first overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and his Jaguars teammates. Last season, Jacksonville finished the year at 3-14 following coach Urban Meyer’s tumultuous tenure, which resulted in his December 2021 ouster after a series of missteps. The Jaguars hired Super Bowl-winning head coach Doug Pederson in February. Despite a slow start, Jacksonville won its last five games to finish the regular season with a 9-8 record. “After the bye week, we started correcting some things and started rolling. It’s cool to see a team come together like we have, and we’re just excited to get another opportunity next week,” Lawrence said. When the Jaguars roll into the wild-card round next weekend, Lawrence will likely be counting on Marissa for support. Together since their college days, Lawrence proposed to Marissa in July 2020 before tying the knot in April 2021.
