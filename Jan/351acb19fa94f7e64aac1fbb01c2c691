Action Network NFL analyst C Jackson Cowart is in his first season in The Post’s Bettor’s Guide. Here are his best bets for Week 17. I’m as wary of laying a big number on the Giants as the next guy, but the Colts are an unmitigated disaster right now amid a blatant tank job that just keeps getting worse. Indianapolis has lost five straight, which includes the NFL’s third-biggest margin of the season (35 points) and the biggest collapse in league history (33 points). That’s to say nothing of last week’s 20-3 clunker, when Nick Foles threw three interceptions in his first start of the year. He is back under center on Sunday, once again without Jonathan Taylor (ankle) to breathe life into this run game. At this point, I’ve seen all I need to see to blindly bet against the Colts at anything short of a touchdown. This total is set to be only the fourth all season to close below 36 points. The other three all went Under, and I’m expecting the same result in this one on the strength of these defenses. The Steelers’ defense has allowed 17 or fewer points in each of the past five weeks, and the Ravens own the NFL’s stingiest scoring defense (11.3 ppg) in December. Both units showed out in Baltimore’s 16-14 win in Week 14, and this rivalry has produced four straight Unders. Last week: 1-1. Seahawks (L), Buccaneers-Cardinals Under (W). Season: 14-15-1.
