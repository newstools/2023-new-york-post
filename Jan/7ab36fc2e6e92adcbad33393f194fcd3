One rival executive complained the Pirates are looking for a “Juan Soto trade” for Bryan Reynolds, who seeks a way out of Pittsburgh. Reynolds does have three years to go in his contract, whereas Soto had 2 1/2, and Reynolds obviously makes much less money. But Soto is an elite player. Consider that the Pirates offered Reynolds about $76 million, while the Nationals offered Soto $440 million. Another exec predicts Reynolds will stay now, based on the asking price, but holds hope for a deadline deal. The belief is that the Pirates seek at least three to four top prospects (the Nationals got five for Soto). From the Yankees, who would be interested, that would likely mean multiple players from the top group that includes Oswald Peraza, Anthony Volpe and Jasson Dominguez. The Mets’ prime interest is in a fourth outfielder now, and Andrew McCutchen is a consideration. Adam Duvall, David Peralta, Jurickson Profar, Trey Mancini and Tyler Naquin also remain available. The Mets are considering Zack Britton, who formerly starred for Buck Showalter’s Orioles – although they seem to prefer guys who have options now. Some Mets people were deadly serious in their interest in Trea Turner to play center field. They never had much of a shot, though, since Turner had monster shortstop offers. Some believe he’d be better in center field than shortstop, where he’s considered average. Francisco Alvarez and Brett Baty both will be given a chance to make the Mets, but considering more opportunity to play the field, Alvarez likely has a slightly better chance than Baty. The Marlins were after Baty and Eduardo Escobar when it looked like Carlos Correa was going to the Mets. The Marlins have made available starting pitchers Pablo Lopez, Jesus Luzardo, Taylor Rogers and Edward Cabrera. The Marlins talked to the Twins about Lopez. Luis Arraez and Max Kepler were said to be names discussed, but Minnesota doesn’t want to part with Arraez.
