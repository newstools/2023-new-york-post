Santa came to town — with 20 pounds of cocaine. Adderly Santos Familia was caught smuggling bricks of coke in stuffed Santa toys at JFK Airport on Dec. 14 after arriving from Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, according to Homeland Security Investigations. More powdery drugs were also found in two airplane neck pillows and the lining of his baggage during a Customs and Border Protection screening, court filings said. Familia, who lives in Queens told authorities he had been visiting family in the Dominican Republic. The Feds found nearly nine kilos of cocaine in his belongings, according to court filings. Prosecutors included a photo of the small plush Santas, with a mixture of stuffing and cocaine packets torn out of them. When asked about the pillows, which were the first items authorities gutted, Familia told officers that he had gotten them from his children. The amount of cocaine seized has a street value of between $260,000 and $1 million, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s latest estimates. Familia was charged with the importation of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, felonies punishable by up to life in prison and $10 million in fines. He was released the following day on a $100,000 bond. Familia’s attorney, Leticia Olivera, did not respond to requests for comment.
