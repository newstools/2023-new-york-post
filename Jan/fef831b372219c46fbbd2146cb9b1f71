An Amtrak train got stranded for 37 hours in South Carolina — leaving passengers so panicked, they were calling 911 believing they were being held hostage. The Auto Train left Virginia at 5 p.m. Monday and was supposed to reach Orlando, Fla. by 10 a.m. Tuesday — but was forced to change course after a CSX freight train hit a vehicle left on the tracks in South Carolina. Thrown off its route, the Amtrak train experienced “significant delays” and was stopped in Denmark, South Carolina, awaiting the arrival of a new crew, Amtrak told ABC News. “The train was detoured off its normal route in order to continue operating south,” Amtrak said. Despite Amtrak claiming to have provided ample updates, concerned passengers were apparently calling 911 from the train when it was stuck in rural South Carolina, according to videos taken aboard the train. “For those of you that are calling the police, we are not holding you hostage,” a conductor said over the loudspeaker. “We are giving you all the information in which we have. We are sorry about the inconvenience.” The conductor also apparently asked passengers not to open their windows and smoke on the train. After nearly 20 hours of delays, the 563 passengers and 333 vehicles were able to disembark Wednesday morning after the train pulled into the station in Sanford, Fla., concluding the 37-hour saga. In a statement, Amtrak said it had given “regular updates to customers, along with meals, snack packs and beverages.” The train’s staff also worked with pet owners to provide “bathroom breaks,” the statement said.
