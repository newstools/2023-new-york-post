What a wild sequence of events this offseason for Carlos Correa. He went from being a member of the Minnesota Twins in 2022 to opting out to become a free agent. We then thought he was headed to the Giants, but that did not happen. We then thought he was going to the Mets for 12 years, $315 million. That deal hit a snafu. He is now back where he started, re-joining the Twins. The drama is over. To talk about the signing, we bring you a new episode of “The Show” with Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman. The guys also chat with Correa’s old manager in Houston A.J. Hinch. The Tigers skipper talks Correa, Justin Verlander, the Tigers’ struggles last season and their future.
