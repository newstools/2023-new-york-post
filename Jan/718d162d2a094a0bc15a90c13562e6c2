They’re ready to get the ball rolling. On Feb. 12, 122 adoptable pooches will go nose-to-nose as they vie for the Lombarky Trophy at the 19th annual Puppy Bowl. The three-hour televised adoption event will feature pups, including ones with disabilities, from 67 shelters spanning 34 states – and one even hails from the West Indies. This year, Team Ruff comes in as the underdog after suffering a defeat in last year’s Bowl against Team Fluff. In a sneak peek of the competition, Animal Planet’s showdown preview offers a glimpse into the action as returning referee Dan Schachner flags a pupper for “excessive hydration.” The canine in question is Florida native Divinci, a labradoodle who took a splash into his water bowl. “Wow, it’s like picking up a wet sponge,” Schachner, who is returning for his 12th year, says of the sopping pup. Fluff’s very own Pickle the Pomeranian suffered a foul, too – “dog collar tackle.” The mischievous fluffball chomped down on another pup’s bandana on the field, prompting Schachner’s intervention. But the playful pooch attempted to shush the ref by placing a paw up to his face. Puppy Bowl, which airs on Animal Planet and Discovery+, is hailed as the longest-running televised adoption event. During the telecast, pup lovers can learn about each pooch that needs a loving home, including their breed and outstanding traits. While the pre-game show begins at 1 p.m. ET on SuperBowl Sunday, kickoff is at 2 p.m. ET live on Animal Planet or through discovery+ streaming. The competition, with sportscasters Steve Levy and Taylor Rooks offering their play-by-play commentary, will take a brief break for the Kitty Halftime show. Similarly to years past, Puppy Bowl XIX was filmed ahead of time, so many of the fan-favorite Fidos will already be adopted by the time the Bowl hits screens around the country.
