A Pennsylvania police plane circled the family home where accused quadruple killer Bryan Kohberger was arrested for hours — even after the bust, flight records show. A single-engine 2019 Textron Aviation 208B repeatedly rounded Kohberger’s parents’ home in Albrightsville, Pa., from 4:02 a.m. to 6:22 a.m. last Friday, even after state police and the FBI had raided the dwelling, Fox News reported, citing air traffic data Kohberger, who has been accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students was extradited from Pennsylvania to Moscow, Idaho, this week and appeared in magistrate court Thursday. A recently unsealed police affidavit revealed that police obtained a DNA sample from the metal snap on a Ka-Bar knife sheath found at a six-bedroom Moscow home where Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20, and Xana Kernodle, 20, were killed. One of the two surviving roommates said that she froze after waking up the night of the murders to see a “figure clad in black clothing and a mask” strolling past her and exiting the house through the back glass sliding door, leaving law enforcement “puzzled” over why neither roommate called 911 until noon. Kohberger is currently facing first-degree murder charges and could get the death penalty. He was not asked to submit a plea but has indicated that he with plead not guilty.
