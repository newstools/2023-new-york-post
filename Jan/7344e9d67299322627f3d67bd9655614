A public memorial for the late Lisa Marie Presley will be held at Graceland this Sunday, her family announced Monday. Presley, the only child of rock and roll legend Elvis Presley, died Thursday after she went into cardiac arrest in her California home. She was 54 and is survived by three daughters and her mother Priscilla. “Riley, Harper, Finley, and Priscilla are grateful for the support, well-wishes, and outpouring of love honoring their beloved Lisa Marie. A public memorial service has been arranged on the front lawn of Graceland at 9:00 am on Sunday, January 22 in Memphis,” the family said in a statement. “In lieu of flowers, the family encourages all who wish to send something to do so in the form of a donation to The Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation,” the family additionally said. The foundation is a non-profit that focuses on the arts, education and children’s programs in the Memphis/Whitehaven area. The famous Tennessee property, where the memorial will take place, will be passed down to Riley Keough, 33, and twins Harper and Finley Lockwood, 14, a representative for Graceland confirmed to People Monday. The famous home is where Lisa Marie was raised. It’s also where Elvis died in 1977 at 42. Reps previously told Page Six that Lisa Marie will be laid to rest there with her father and late son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide at 27 in 2020.
