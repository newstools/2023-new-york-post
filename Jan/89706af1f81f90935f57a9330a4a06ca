The Green Bay Packers control their own destiny. If Green Bay wins, then they are in. However, it is not the same for the Lions, who need to win and have the Seattle Seahawks lose. Although, with this game pushed into primetime, the Lions will now know fate before kickoff. Though according to head coach Dan Campbell, whether or not the Lions are eliminated before kickoff will not matter. Campbell insisted that the goal is to win the game no matter what. We’ve seen how inspired the Lions have played recently, winning seven of their last nine games to be in this position. Detroit should come out motivated, and we can back the Lions early by taking them at +3.5 in the first half on BetMGM. 21+. NY, CO, DC, IA, IN, MI, NJ, NV, PA, TN, WV, IA, VA, WV, and WY only. T&Cs apply. If padding your bankroll without actually placing a bet sounds good to you, then you’ll want to check out BetMGM’s “refer a friend” bonus.
