Island life looks a lot less stressful than coaching in the NFL. On Thursday, Kliff Kingsbury’s girlfriend Veronika Bielik shared bikini-clad photos and videos to Instagram from her outdoor adventures in Thailand, where the former Arizona Cardinals coach reportedly bought a one-way ticket after he was fired by the team earlier this month. The 29-year-old Bielik — who has been linked to Kingsbury since 2020 — included photos of her sitting on a beach in Koh Samui (Thailand’s second largest island), petting a pig and feeding elephants. “Life lately ,”  Bielik wrote in her caption. “Places to visit in Koh Samui: – Elephant sanctuary called Haven  – pig island – magic Buddha garden – try local Roti pancakes and mango sticky rice 🫠 – Na muang 2 waterfall with an awesome hike – silver beach that looks like beaches in Seychelles.” Bielik also took to her Instagram Story to share videos of her fishing and tagged “Exotic Fishing Thailand” in her post. The 43-year-old Kingsbury was not pictured in the photos, and the former Texas Tech coach has not yet confirmed his presence in Thailand. Some, however, believe Kingsbury is behind the camera. Kingsbury and Bielik have yet to publicly address the status of their relationship. The fashion and lifestyle influencer — who’s approaching four million followers on Instagram — is the co-founder of Spotlight Agency, an influencer management agency. Earlier this month, Peter Schrager reported on Fox Sports’ NFL pregame show that Kingsbury “bought a one-way ticket to Thailand,” and has told interested teams “that he is not interested in returning at the moment.” That came days after the Cardinals fired Kingsbury following a disappointing 4-13 campaign. Kingsbury, who joined the organization in 2019, had signed a multi-year extension with the team last March. “He’s being paid five years guaranteed by the Arizona Cardinals,” Schrager said. “That check hits every two weeks. He’s going to take his time before he figures out if he wants to come back to football.” Pro Football Talk also reported that Kingsbury’s “lack of interest in other jobs could jeopardize his buyout.” The Cardinals have not yet filled their coaching vacancy, though the team is reportedly interested in former Saints coach Sean Payton.
