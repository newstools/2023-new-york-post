“Big Bang Theory” actor Simon Helberg and his wife, Jocelyn Towne, have listed their Los Angeles residence for $9 million, The Post has learned. Made up of five bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms, the home is located in the Los Feliz Oaks neighborhood. The actor, who played the role of Howard Wolowitz, purchased the home in 2019 for $6.87 million. The sitcom concluded that same year after a 12-year run. A private and gated Spanish Colonial estate, the property was even previously owned by Vince Vaughn. Features of the property include a flat lawn, a meditation sanctuary with a koi pond — and a terraced hillside with an orchard of fruit trees, wildflowers and seating areas, the listing notes. There’s also an outdoor dining area and a saltwater pool. The offering comes with an additional one-bedroom, one-bathroom guest house. Interior features include a grand living space with a newly installed gas fireplace. The den, kitchen and dining area have an open-concept flow. The primary suite boasts treetop views, a new custom walk-in closet with a skylight — plus an all-new ensuite bathroom featuring a steam shower with heated seats, an in-shower speaker and a built-in infrared sauna with Bluetooth capabilities, the listing adds. Elisa Ritt, Anthony Stellini and Sherri Rogers of Compass hold the listing. The home briefly listed for sale last April for about a month before it was taken off the market. “It is incredibly rare to find such a private largely flat 3/4 of an acre in the coveted Los Feliz Oaks, let alone a pristinely restored 1920’s Spanish with a pool and guest house,” Ritt told The Post. “You’ll find that no expense has been spared and every room features the highly acclaimed bespoke interior design of Nickey/Kehoe.”
