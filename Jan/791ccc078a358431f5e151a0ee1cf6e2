What frustration? That’s the message LeBron James seemed to put forth Sunday afternoon, hours after The Athletic posted a story suggesting the Lakers superstar was losing patience over the team’s roster plans. “Hey Sam actually my patience isn’t waning. You make it sound like I’m frustrated when I’m really not. I told you over and over, my job is focused on the guys in the locker room, my job isn’t the roster. That’s the reality of that conversation,” James tweeted. The 18-time NBA All-Star was responding to a tweet from Sam Amick of The Athletic, who shared a link to the story and added further context about the coverage. “LeBron James to @TheAthletic on the Lakers’ roster plans: ‘Y’all know what the f–k should be happening.’ More here on his waning patience, how his greatness is forcing this conversation, and why he deserves more help.” James, 38, added in his message to Amick that his comments were made with “the upmost respect and calmness cause that’s the mood I’m in!” He concluded his tweets by hyping up the Lakers’ recent five-game winning streak. Although the Lakers have turned things around as of late, James vented his frustrations late last month as the team continued to struggle. “I want to win and give myself a chance to win and still compete for championships. That has always been my passion. It’s always been my goal since I entered the league… Once you get there and you know how to get there, playing basketball at this level just to be playing basketball is not in my DNA. It’s not in my DNA anymore, so we’ll see what happens and how fresh my mind stays over the next couple years,” James said at the time. With the Feb. 9 trade deadline looming, Lakers fans — and likely James himself — will be looking to see what could happen between now and then.
