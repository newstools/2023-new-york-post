Oh my, that’s a big pizza pie! Pizza Hut officially made the “World’s Largest Pizza” with the help of YouTuber Airrack (Eric Decker), according to the Guinness Book of World Records. On Jan. 18, nearly 14,000 square feet of the Los Angeles Convention Center was covered by 3,653 pounds of dough, 4,948 pounds of sweet marinara sauce, more than 8,800 pounds of cheese and nearly 630,496 pepperoni to create the largest pizza in the world. Pizza Hut workers and the vlogger rolled out the layers of dough, painted the sauce on and then tossed on the toppings. The record-breaking pizza was made in honor of the return of Pizza Hut’s “The Big New Yorker” recipe: a pepperoni pizza made of foldable slices to be eaten on the go in true NYC fashion. The pie was then cooked in sections by a mobile broiler before being portioned into 68,000 slices — much of which were donated to several local charities, confirmed David Graves, resident of Pizza Hut. Airrack shared that he had planned “The World’s Largest Pizza Party” as revenge on all those who didn’t come to his eighth birthday party. “True story: When I was 8 yrs old I threw a pizza party at a bowling alley and no one showed up. To get revenge, I spent the past 18 years scheming how to make the world’s largest pizza and today it happened. No one out-pizzas the hut,” he tweeted with a photo of himself holding the official world record next to the pie. Airrack sold tickets to attend the pizza party and merchandise boasting “Everybody gets a slice.” The previous Guinness record for the world’s largest pizza was set in 2012 by a group of Italian chefs who made a gluten-free pizza measuring 13,580 square feet.
