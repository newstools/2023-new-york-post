Neither rain, sleet or snow or a college basketball game in progress will stop a food delivery from being made. While play was going on during the second half of Wednesday’s Loyola Chicago Ramblers-Duquesne Dukes game, a delivery person walked onto the court with a bag of fast food, getting very close to a player who was set up on the 3-point line. Play was momentarily stopped with 16:10 remaining and Loyola Chicago holding a 40-37 lead while the situation was being digested. The shocked ESPN+ broadcast crew was left with a bevy of questions. “Who’s he delivering it to?” they shouted. “The ref!?” The announcers speculated it was an Uber Eats delivery person delivering some McDonalds to referee Phillip Austin, adding that the highlight shows “will have a blast” with this story. According to Abby Schnable of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the fan who actually ordered the food was later shown on the video board. “Craziest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Duquesne coach Keith Dambrot said. “Guy had a job to do. He did his job well.” For the appetizer portion of this story, Duquesne (14-17, 4-4 Atlantic 10) scored a 72-58  win over Loyola/Chicago (7-13, 1-7).
