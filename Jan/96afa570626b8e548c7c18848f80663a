Julia Louis-Dreyfus has nothing but love for her son Charlie Hall’s performance on “The Sex Lives of College Girls” — even his sex scenes. The 62-year-old actress shared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” that she’s seen the hit HBO Max show that stars her son along with Pauline Chalamet (indeed, sister of Timothy), Reneé Rapp and Amrit Kaur — and it’s “very racy.” Kimmel, 55, asked Louis-Dreyfus if she watches the show “in fear” that she might see something she “hasn’t seen for a while.” “I think he was really great, I mean, he was adorable. He was f—ing some girl in the library and I thought it was dynamite!” the “Veep” star shared. “Makes you feel good about teaching them how to read, right?” Kimmel quipped in response. Hall, 25, appeared in the Mindy Kaling-created series in Season 2 as Andrew, a biology student who becomes Whitney’s (Alyah Chanelle Scott) love interest. He’s followed in the footsteps of both his mom and dad, actor Brad Hall, 64, with credits in TV and movie projects such as “Moxie,” “Bel-Air” and “Love, Victor.” Before acting, he made headlines playing basketball as a freshman walk-on for the Northwestern basketball team. Louis-Dreyfus is the star of the new movie “You Hurt My Feelings,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this week.
