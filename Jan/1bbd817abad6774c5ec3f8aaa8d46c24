Eagles defensive end Josh Sweat was taken to a hospital Sunday after being stretchered off the field following a scary neck injury in Philadelphia. Sweat came around the edge to make a tackle on Saints running back Adam Prentice midway through the first quarter. His helmet made contact first with Prentice before Sweat remained face-down on the field, surrounded by teammates taking a knee as a cart eventually came out to get him. The Eagles said Sweat had movement in all extremities and was transported to a local hospital for precautionary reasons. Sweat, 25, is in the midst of a career year with 11 sacks and 15 tackles for loss. The 2018 fourth-round pick out of Florida State earned his first Pro Bowl nod last year when he had 7.5 sacks. The Eagles entered Sunday 13-2 as they tried to wrap up the top seed in the NFC â€“ needing a win over the Saints to clinch home-field advantage and a first-round bye.
