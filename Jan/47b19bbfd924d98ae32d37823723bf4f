Jalen Hurts isn’t just breaking the hearts of 49ers fans. The 24-year-old Eagles quarterback has the internet buzzing after he appeared to debut his girlfriend after defeating the Niners in the NFC Championship game on Sunday. Hurts is dating Bryonna “Bry” Burrows, according to multiple reports, which say the pair met while at Alabama — before the quarterback transferred to Oklahoma and finished his college career with the Sooners. They reportedly have been in an on-and-off relationship since 2016. Burrows graduated from Alabama in 2017 with a degree in political science, and went on to earn her MBA at the school, according to her LinkedIn profile. In 2018, Burrows was vice president of the MBA Association and captain of the national award-winning MBA Case Team. She was also in the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority as an undergrad. Burrows currently works for IBM as an Al Partner, per her LinkedIn. “I have proven success and influence in strategic business planning and client relationship management,” her LinkedIn bio reads in part. After the conference championship game, Hurts was photographed on the field at the Linc with a brunette woman, who was wearing sunglasses — and it is believed to be Burrows. They were pictured smiling and hugging together, and cameras captured the woman talking and embracing with Hurts’ loved ones. Hurts and the woman, who was dressed in a cut-out beige top and dark pants, eventually made their way to the back hallways of the Linc, where they were seen talking and smiling together. The quarterback never identified the woman by his side before they appeared to the leave the stadium together. Hurts is known to be private about his personal life. He often explains that he is focused on his football career — and lives by a motto from his father, Averion Hurts: “Keep the main thing the main thing.” The Eagles will face the Chiefs at State Farm Stadium in Arizona in Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 12.
