Kristin Cavallari is coming clean. When reflecting on previous relationships Tuesday during the latest episode of her “Back to the Beach” podcast – where she and her former “Laguna Beach” flame, Stephen Colletti, recap the beloved MTV reality series – Cavallari, 36, opened up about her past romance with former USC quarterback Matt Leinart. “Matt is the nicest human being on the planet. He is such a great guy,” the Uncommon James founder gushed of Leinart, whom she dated when she was 18. “He was a five-year senior at USC. He was on top of the world that year.” Though Cavallari spoke about her relationship with Leinart on-camera, particularly in the show’s Season 2 premiere that aired in 2005, she didn’t divulge his last name at the time. Leinart, who was selected 10th overall in the 2006 NFL Draft, played for the Cardinals before bouncing around the league, which included stops with the Texans and Raiders. The 39-year-old now serves as a college football analyst and has been married to wife Josie, the host of the “Women of the League” web series, since 2018. Cavallari went on to marry former Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in 2013 before calling it quits in 2020. They share three children together: sons Camden, 10, and Jaxon, 8, and 7-year-old daughter Saylor. The best-selling author added on Tuesday’s podcast that she isn’t looking to date athletes in the future. “To be honest, I don’t want to say anything I’m going to end up regretting, but I don’t think I want to date another athlete. I’ve done that. I want to leave that in the past,” she said. Cavallari was recently spotted with “Bachelorette” alum Tyler Cameron on New Year’s Eve. The two shared a kiss in an ad for her Uncommon James jewelry collection last spring.
