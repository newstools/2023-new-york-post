A high school basketball coach in Virginia has been fired after impersonating a 13-year-old player in a game. Arlisha Boykins, a 22-year-old assistant coach on the Churchland junior varsity girls basketball team in Portsmouth, suited up for the Truckers while a teenage student-athlete was out of town at a club basketball tournament, parents of the girl told WAVY TV 10. In video footage from the Jan. 21 game, which took place in Suffolk against Nansemond River, Boykins can be seen wearing a black No. 1 jersey for Churchland while playing in the contest. Boykins, who was going up against 14-and-15-year-old girls, recorded a block and drove to the basket for a layup in highlights obtained by WAVY. She was also seen interacting with the team, shooting free throws and at one point, dove into the stands for a loose ball. In addition to Boykins, the Truckers’ junior varsity head coach and the head coach of the varsity team were fired — with sources telling the outlet that the varsity coach was “encouraging the behavior” during the game. “Coaches always preach to the kids about integrity and those types of things, so I was just shocked,” the father of the 13-year-old said. The girl’s family told WAVY their daughter is no longer interested in attending Churchland High School next year and will pursue another school. The family is also seeking a personal apology from Churchland school officials. The Churchland junior varsity players and parents chose to forgo the remainder of the season and not play any more games. The school is currently investigating the incident.
