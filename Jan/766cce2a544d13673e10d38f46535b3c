A 16-year-old boy was jumped by two older teens and stabbed in a Yonkers school Friday morning, police said. The brawl erupted after an argument between the victim and two 17-year-old boys in the second-floor bathroom of Yonkers Middle-High School around 8:40 a.m., police said. The older teens started to kick and punch the young student before one of the suspects pulled a knife and stabbed the victim, according to police. School security broke up the fight and Yonkers police arrested the two 17-year-olds on charges of felony assault, cops said. The 16-year-old was taken to a local hospital for surgery. He was expected to recover. The names of the teens involved were not released due to their age.
