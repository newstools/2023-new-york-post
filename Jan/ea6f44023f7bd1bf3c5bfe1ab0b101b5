The Chicago Cubs will open a new sportsbook at Wrigley Field this year, and fans want to know: Will the Ricketts family use the extra revenue to help the franchise on the diamond? “I certainly wish the sportsbook will make me the kind of money that Steve Cohen has,” Cubs co-owner Tom Ricketts said during the weekend-long Cubs Convention on Saturday, according to ESPN reporter Jesse Rogers. The Ricketts family, which is worth about $3.7 billion, according to Forbes, has come under scrutiny in recent years for what fans perceive to be a lack of team payroll spending, which has taken a dive since the pandemic hit. After having a club-record $222 million estimated payroll in 2019, Chicago finished the 2022 season with an estimated $146 million payroll, according to FanGraphs. There have been grumblings in recent months about Cohen’s spending by other MLB team owners, the New York Post’s Jon Heyman reported in December. The Mets’ payroll is nearly 24 percent higher than the next highest team, at $357.7 million to $289 million for the Yankees — and that is without added the luxury-tax money Cohen will also have to shell out. Cohen is worth around $17.6 billion, according to Forbes The Chicago Cubs made DraftKings their exclusive sports betting and daily fantasy partner in fall 2021.  The deal that is expected to bring in about $100 million over a decade’s worth of rights, according to Action Network’s Darren Rovell.
