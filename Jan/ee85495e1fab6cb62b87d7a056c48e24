Months after laying off thousands of employees at Twitter, new owner Elon Musk is now downsizing its San Francisco headquarters. The social media platform, which Musk took over in October in a whopping $44 billion deal, has reduced its space by two-thirds at 1355 Market St., the San Francisco Business Times reported, citing the New York Times. After missing rent payments, Twitter has gone from six floors to occupying only two. Twitter laid off about half of its 7,500-employee global workforce in early November, as Musk enacted a drastic cost-cutting plan. This included 800 who were based in San Francisco. Shorenstein Properties, which owns the building with JPMorgan, is negotiating with lenders after missing a September deadline to refinance its $400 million loan on the property, according to the Real Deal. Complaints within the company have since skyrocketed, with many insiders claiming the tech company smells like take-out food and body odor, with employees having to bring their own toilet paper, the Times reported. (This happened shortly after Musk fired janitorial staff that went on strike.) Musk, responding on Twitter, said employees only had to bring their own bath tissue for “half a day.” Twitter is also reportedly set to close its Seattle and New York City offices in an effort to cut costs. The social media company still has more than 2,000 employees.
