Twenty years after LeBron James become a McDonald’s All-American, his oldest son has received the same honor. Bronny James was named to the boys’ McDonald’s All-American game on Tuesday as part of the West roster. The 18-year-old is a 6-foot-3 point guard at Sierra Canyon in Los Angeles. “Ayyyyyyyeeeeee @bronny!!!!!! Congratulations Son!” LeBron, 38, wrote on Instagram. “So damn proud of you! Continue to be you through it all no matter what!! You’re truly AMAZING!!! #JamesGang . P.S. Congrats to all the other men and women who was named as well in the 2023 Class Micky D’s games! It’s an HONOR.” LeBron James was MVP of the 2003 McDonald’s All-American game in Cleveland and three months later was selected No. 1 overall by the Cavaliers. This year’s game will take place in Houston on March 28. Bronny reacted to the news on his own Instagram account. “Prada you #BURGERBOYYYYYY,” he wrote. Because of age restrictions, Bronny James can’t make the jump straight to the NBA like his dad did. Bronny, a four-star recruit, has yet to choose which college he’ll play for in the fall. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that his top three schools are Ohio State, USC and Oregon. “I’m still open, but those are options,” Bronny James told On3. Andrej Stojakovic, the son of former NBA All-Star Peja Stojakovic, was also named a McDonald’s All-American, as was Dajuan Wagner Jr., whose dad played with LeBron James on the Cavaliers.
