Jim Harbaugh remains the Michigan Man. University of Michigan president Santa Ono announced Monday that Harbaugh informed him he will remain head coach of the Wolverines and will not leave the program this offseason to return to the NFL. “I just got off the phone with Coach Harbaugh and Jim shared with me the great news that he is going to remain as the Head Coach of the Michigan Wolverines,” Ono tweeted. “That is fantastic news that I have communicated to our Athletic Director Warde Manuel. #GoBlue!” The Michigan football program also released a statement from Harbaugh confirming the news. “I love the relationships I have at Michigan — coaches, staff, families, administration, President Santa Ono and especially the players and their families,” Harbaugh said. “My heart is at the University of Michigan. I once heard a wise man say, ‘Don’t try to out-happy, happy.’ Go Blue!” For the second straight offseason, rumors of Harbaugh’s return to the NFL ran rampant. Harbaugh, 59, did do a virtual interview with the Denver Broncos this offseason. He previously coached the 49ers from 2011-14. He had a 44-19-1 record in the regular season and 5-3 in the playoffs. They were the NFC champions of the 2012-13 season before losing to the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. Harbaugh has coached the Wolverines since 2015. Michigan was an undefeated 13-0 this past season before the College Football Playoff. It was the program’s second straight year beating Ohio State, winning the Big Ten and reaching the national semifinals. In the semis, Michigan fell to TCU, 51-45.
