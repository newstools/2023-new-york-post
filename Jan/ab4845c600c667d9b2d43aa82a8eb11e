A man was struck by a car that sped off during an alleged hit-and-run accident in Queens on Sunday night, cops said. The 65-year-old man was crossing Merrick Boulevard near 233rd Street in Laurelton just before 7 p.m. when the driver of a dark-colored sedan barreled into him, according to police. The driver then allegedly sped off without checking on the person who was struck, according to cops. The victim was rushed to Jamaica Hospital where he was listed in critical condition late Sunday night. He was not immediately identified. The driver remains at large and the investigation is ongoing. Police initially reported that the man was struck by two drivers who both fled the scene, before learning that there was just one car involved. A police spokesperson said they are only looking for one hit-and-run driver.
