Michigan has fired co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss following an investigation into unspecified “computer access crimes.” The program revealed the investigation earlier this week and announced Weiss’ termination on Friday. “After a review of University policies, the athletic department has terminated the appointment of co-offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Matt Weiss,” Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. “Consistent with university policy, we will have no further comment on this personnel matter.” Weiss spoke positively of the program in his exit statement. “I am proud of the success we achieved over the last two seasons and grateful to all of the Michigan players, coaches, and staff,” Weiss tweeted. “The potential of Team 144 [the number of seasons the Wolverines have played] knows no bounds. I have nothing but respect for the University of Michigan and the people who make it such a great place. I look forward to putting this matter behind me and returning to the game that I love.” Earlier this week, it emerged that University of Michigan police were investigating Weiss, for alleged “computer access crimes” that occurred at Schembechler Hall, the team’s practice facility, in December. Weiss worked for Jim Harbaugh as a graduate assistant at Stanford from 2005-08, and joined his Michigan staff in 2021. In between, Weiss was an assistant for Harbaugh’s brother John’s staff on the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL. Michigan went 13-0 this season, handily defeating hated rival Ohio State, and then winning the Big Ten before losing to TCU in the College Football Playoff semifinals. After another round of rumors that he might return to the NFL, Jim Harbaugh announced earlier this week that he would be returning as Michigan’s head coach in 2023.
