Former President Donald Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of ​Rep.-elect Kevin McCarthy’s bid to become House speaker Wednesday morning, urging all Republicans to “VOTE FOR KEVIN.” “​Some really good conversations took place last night, and it’s now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY, & WATCH CRAZY NANCY PELOSI FLY BACK HOME TO A VERY BROKEN CALIFORNIA, THE ONLY SPEAKER IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE LOST THE ​’​HOUSE​’ TWICE!,” the 76-year-old former president said in a posting on his Truth Social platform. “REPUBLICANS, DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. IT’S TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU DESERVE IT. Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB – JUST WATCH!​” Trump added. Moments later, Trump reiterated: “TAKE THE VICTORY AND RUN!!!” The hearty endorsement of McCarthy (R-Calif.), who failed to win the speakership in three ballots on Tuesday, comes after Trump gave a less than enthusiastic response when asked after the votes whether he was still in the former minority leader’s corner​, saying “we’ll see what happens.” “I got everybody calling me wanting my support. But let’s see what happens and we’ll go — I got everybody calling, wanting my support,” the former president told NBC News. “That’s all I can say. But we’ll see what happens. We’ll see how it all works out.” McCarthy said Tuesday night he had spoken to Trump and the 45th president still backed his bid. “Trump has already reiterated his support; I talked to him tonight,” McCarthy told reporters after a closed-door meeting with allies. Asked if Trump wanted him to keep pursuing the speaker’s gavel, McCarthy said, “Oh, yeah.” “He thinks it’s better that all the Republicans get together and solve this, it doesn’t look good for Republicans, but we want to be able to solve it where we’re stronger in the long run,” ​he added. “Where what we went through today in the end becomes a positive that we’re actually focused, united.” T​he House adjourned Tuesday night after McCarth​y failed to get the required 218 votes in the chamber to win the post. There are 222 Republicans in the House, so McCarthy can only afford to lose four to reach the threshold required. But in Tuesday’s voting, 19 GOP members voted against him on the first two ballots, while 20 opposed him on the third. One of those holdouts, Rep.-elect Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), responded to Trump’s statement Wednesday by telling Fox News: “Sad! This changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote.” Trump, in another posting Wednesday morning, said if Republicans want to fight, they should grapple with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s leadership. “If Republicans are going to fight, we ought to be fighting Mitch McConnell and his domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow,” he said, once again repeating a racial slur against McConnell’s spouse and Trump’s former transportation secretary, Elaine Chao. “The harm they have done to the Republican Party is incalculable.” “Today, he couldn’t be elected ‘Dog Catcher’ in Kentucky (Sadly, he only won because of my Endorsement, went up 21 points – SORRY!),” Trump added. The House was scheduled to reconvene Wednesday at noon to continue voting on the speaker position.
