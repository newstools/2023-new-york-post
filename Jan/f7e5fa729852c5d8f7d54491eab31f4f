A rare coin dealer from California reported being robbed of $100,000 in inventory at a convention in the Big Apple earlier this month, The Post has learned. The 67-year-old man from Palo Alto told cops his valuable coins were swiped from his booth at the  New York International Numismatic Convention, which ran from Jan. 12 to 15 at the InterContinental New York Barclay hotel in Midtown. The dealer set up his booth on Jan. 12, and took steps to keep it safe, including putting chairs on top of the table, before he left at around 7 p.m. that day, according to the report he filed with the NYPD. But when he came back around noon the next day, the chairs had been taken down and his showcase was on the floor — with the valuables gone, the dealer told cops. Surveillance video obtained by investigators showed a man taking the approximately $100,000 in coins, putting them in a rollerbag and then leaving, according to cops and sources.“I guess he felt it was in a hotel so it was secure,” a police source said. “Obviously, someone took it anyway.” Paul Russell, New York International Numismatic Convention chairman, disputed the timeline, saying the dealer left at around 6:35 or 6:40 p.m. — before the show closed for the day — and the coins were stolen while the public was there. “He left a little bit early,” Russell told The Post on Monday. “We were still open for business. We had the general public on the convention grounds.” The victim runs a business based in Arizona that bills itself as “a leading buyer and seller of World, ancient and Mexican and Latin American coins and currency,” according to its website. There were no immediate arrests, cops said.
