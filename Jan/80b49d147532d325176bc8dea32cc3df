Maybe you first fell in love with the comedic stylings of Steve Martin and Martin Short in the 1986 comedy classic “Three Amigos.” Or it could have been “Father of the Bride” that did it for you. For newer fans, there’s a very real possibility you became smitten with the duo’s comedic chemistry on their hit Hulu series “Only Murders In The Building.” Now, you can pay your respects to the legends of silly when they embark on the latest 17-show leg of their ongoing “You Won’t Believe What They Look Like Today Tour.” Heck, you might even get to hear some banjo if you’re lucky. On the run of shows, they won’t come to New York City — although they were just in the Big Apple hosting “Saturday Night Live” together — but they do have shows scheduled close by at Red Bank’s Hackensack Meridian Health Center on Oct. 26 and Philadelphia’s Kimmel Center on Oct. 27. Want to know much how much it will run you to see the incomparable duo live this year? Keep reading — we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of the cheapest tickets available for each show on their tour itinerary.
