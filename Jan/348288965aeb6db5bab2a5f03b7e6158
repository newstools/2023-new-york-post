The Mets may be big spenders, but they remain committed to the idea of building from within long term. While Francisco Alvarez, and especially Brett Baty, don’t seem to have a very good chance to crack the Mets’ packed roster, the team is reluctant to trade them. The Marlins tried a couple times to acquire Baty, both before and after the Mets’ Carlos Correa deal fell through. The Marlins were prepared to offer one of their young starters (Edward Cabrera or Jesus Luzardo). Miami did come close to getting Brendan Rodgers from Colorado for Cabrera, but the Rockies ultimately decided not to make that trade. The Yankees have talked to Miami about Jurickson Profar. But the Yankees are adamant (at least for now) about staying under the “Steve Cohen tax” threshold of $293 million. They are at about $290M. They, too, checked in on Josh Harrison. The Mets have been interviewing people for the team president job. It’s considered a business job, not another baseball job. One idea: Angels president John Carpino. He has two years left on his deal, but with the Angels for sale, he could leave. He was part of the decision to hire Billy Eppler for the Angels after they hired Jerry DiPoto over him the first time. The sale of the Angels seems to be going fine, unlike the Nationals sale. One big problem there is the MASN mess. Washington needs cooperation from the Orioles, who have no incentive to help out. The Astros have interviewed several folks for their open GM job and owner Jim Crane is hoping to have someone in place before spring training. Ex-Marlins GM Michael Hill and ex-Giants GM Bobby Evans are among the interviewees. Astros legend Jeff Bagwell has a prominent role in the search and will continue to have a big role in development after a hiring is made. Zack Greinke and the Royals are still in touch.
