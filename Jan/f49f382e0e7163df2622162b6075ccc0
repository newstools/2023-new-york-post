Channing Crowder continued the Mac Jones pile-on. Jones has come under considerable scrutiny for his poor body language amid the ups and downs of the Patriots’ 8-8 season, with Boomer Esiason characterizing the behavior as “douchiness” earlier this week. Crowder was appearing on “The Herd” on FS1 and was asked by Colin Cowherd about his evaluations of the crop of young NFL quarterbacks. The former Dolphins linebacker cited Trevor Lawrence as being in high ascendance now that he’s coached by Doug Pederson instead of Urban Meyer, and predicted he would one day join the echelon of Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. Crowder then took aim at Jones. “I heard you talking earlier [in the show] about the Mac Jones body language,” Crowder said. “It’s called affluenza. [If] you’ve been given too much, you have too much money, you’re a little different. I was around a bunch of rich dudes growing up and I played with rich guys. They just have this little demeanor and you know it gets to you. You brought up Jay Cutler. I would bring up Josh Allen in this conversation. Kyler Murray was a trust fund baby.” The “affluenza” phrase entered the lexicon after the attorney representing Ethan Crouch, who killed four people in a drunk driving accident as a teen in Texas in 2013, submitted as a defense that a wealthy upbringing was responsible for his behavior. Crowder continued to say that there are some people who are born into wealth but remain hungry and level-headed. “There are guys that have money and don’t act like it,” Crowder said. “Zach Thomas, I don’t know if Zach wants me telling this to the world, his dad’s a billionaire. And Zach Thomas is one of the hardest workers I ever touched the field with. It didn’t get to him. That affluenza gets to some [people]. It did not get to Trevor Lawrence.”
