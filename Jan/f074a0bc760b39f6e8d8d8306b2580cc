Quentin Grimes posted an Instagram story on Thursday depicting leaping Knicks teammate Jericho Sims soaring past the basket with his head above the rim. The second-year center, who sat a third straight game Friday, confirmed that he’s “interested” in participating in this year’s Slam Dunk contest, if asked by the NBA, one year after Knicks forward Obi Toppin won the competition. Grimes’ viral video came days after Memphis superstar Ja Morant also had vouched for Sims while quote-tweeting a post stating that Rockets forward Kenyon Martin Jr. already has committed to this year’s dunk contest at All-Star weekend on Feb. 18 in Utah. “Can we get Jericho Sims in there with [Martin] and [Shaedon] Sharpe?” Morant tweeted, referring also to the Trail Blazers’ guard. “Yeah, I saw it,” Sims said when asked about Morant’s post. “I thought it was pretty cool that he wanted to see me in it. I think he’s said something about it before. … It’s funny because he could obviously get in there if he wants to.” Former Knicks forward Taj Gibson, who signed a one-year deal with Washington worth $2.9 million, has averaged 9.7 minutes over 25 appearances with the Wizards. Asked about the improvements the Knicks have made this season, Gibson said he’s not surprised. The 37-year-old Gibson, who also played for Tom Thibodeau in Chicago and Minnesota, added that Julius Randle “has been a on a tear,” Jalen Brunson has been “killing it,” RJ Barrett has been “playing great” and Quentin Grimes “has really grown into himself” this season.
