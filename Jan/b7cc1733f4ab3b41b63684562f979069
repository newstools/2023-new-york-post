Many NBA players have been ejected for many different reasons, but this ejection is certainly unique. On Tuesday night, Milwaukee veteran center Brook Lopez was ejected in the fourth quarter from the Bucks’ 130-122 win over the visiting Toronto Raptors for taking off Gary Trent’s headband when the two were tied up during a play. With 6:40 remaining and the Bucks clinging to a 113-110 lead, Lopez was being held by the Toronto guard and lost his cool, leading to the headband removal and his subsequent ejection. The play set off a brief scuffle between the two teams. Lopez received two technical fouls, resulting in an ejection, according to ESPN, while O.G. Anunoby and Raptors assistant coach Jamaal Magloire each received a technical foul. Bill Kennedy, the crew chief for the three referees, told a pool reporter that Lopez was given one technical for removing Trent’s headband and one for pushing Anunoby. Anunoby received a technical for pushing Lopez and Magloire for pushing Milwaukee’s Bobby Portis, Kennedy said. “I can’t expect the refs to get it right,” Lopez said of his first career ejection. “If they’re not going to get it right during the game, why are they going to get it right when they replay it, or any other calls. It’s what it is.” Lopez scored 15 of his 19 points in the third quarter before being ejected. During the review, one of the officials said the headband rip-off was being reviewed as a “hostile act.” With the win, the Bucks improved to 29-16, while the Raptors, who defeated the Knicks in overtime on Monday, fell to 20-25. Jrue Holiday scored a season-high 37 points for the Bucks, who were playing without Giannis Antetokounmpo for the fourth consecutive game. As for the 34-year-old Lopez, the former Net hasn’t had a reputation for losing his cool during his NBA career, but maybe he’s not a fan of headbands. — with AP
