The defending NBA champions host one of the best young teams in the league tonight when the Golden State Warriors face off against the Memphis Grizzlies in San Francisco. This will be the second matchup of the year for these two teams after Golden State topped Memphis on Christmas Day in SF. The Grizzlies do have the upper hand in the standings, though, as their 31-16 mark is second in the Western Conference behind only the Denver Nuggets. The Warriors enter tonight’s game at 23-24 and are trying to stay in the race for the play-in tournament. Their biggest struggles have been on the road where they’ve gone 6-18, but they aren’t bulletproof at home either, having lost their last four games at the Chase Center. All of that will be in the background tonight when fans get to watch Steph Curry and Ja Morant dazzle the court with their abilities. It should be a fun matchup between teams that met in the playoffs last year and you can bet on it with the FanDuel promo code. 21 or older.
