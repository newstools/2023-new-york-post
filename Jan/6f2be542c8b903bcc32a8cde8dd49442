Fight or flight. Video showing a shirtless man punching a fellow plane passenger has gone viral on Twitter, with users stunned by the brazen act of violence. The footage — initially posted to Twitter two weeks ago — was recorded on board a Boeing 777 operated by Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the national carrier for Bangladesh. The shocking clip shows a shirtless man standing over another passenger, who is seated in an exit row. The two begin to tussle before the topless traveler starts throwing punches, striking the seated man in the head. He was eventually restrained by other passengers, but it is unclear if he was arrested. The altercation was said to be over a seat allocation, Jam Press reported. Music can be heard playing in the background of the viral video, suggesting that the jet was still on the runway at the time of the ugly scene. It’s not known why the violent traveler was shirtless on the aircraft. According to Jam Press, one video of the incident clocked 120,000 Twitter views and dozens of comments. “He’s just asking for his shirt back,” one pundit reportedly cracked after consuming the clip. Airline travel appears to have become more unruly as travelers return to the skies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Already this year, several reports of anti-social airplane antics have landed in the news. Earlier this week, a “drunk Karen” was booted off a flight in Australia, prompting fellow passengers to break out in song. Last week, an Air Canada flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Hawaii after an unruly traveler tried to “choke out” a flight attendant. Meanwhile, on Jan. 6, The Post reported two travelers were caught hurling abuse at AirAsia staff before being removed from one of the carrier’s planes.
