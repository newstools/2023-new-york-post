Peter Morton, the co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, is the secret buyer of a massive $35 million Hamptons estate, Gimme Shelter has learned. The property, at 51 West End Road in East Hampton, was once on the market for $60 million. The sellers are Lloyd and Barbara Macklowe, founders of the Macklowe Gallery on Park Avenue, who bought the estate in 1992 for $3.5 million. The charming five-bedroom stucco-and-shingled home with blue accents was built in 1926 by Roger Bullard, architect of the exclusive Maidstone Club. It comes with sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean and Georgica Pond, and sits on 1.51 acres. The home is beside a property that Morton already owns. “He plans to reunite both properties,” a source said, adding that the combination spans 5 acres. The property comes with a pool, 170 feet of ocean frontage and lush landscaping. The residence was renovated over the past two decades by the late developer Ben Krupinski, the listing notes. (Krupinski died in a 2018 plane crash.) Design details include wide-plank pine floors, a chef’s kitchen with a circular breakfast cranny and a butler’s pantry, formal dining and living rooms, and a den. There’s a junior bedroom suite on the main floor, multiple fireplaces and a home office. Upstairs, the main bedroom suite boasts stunning water views. There’s also a full gym inside and a private beach boardwalk. Designer Calvin Klein recently sold two properties nearby for $85 million. Morton could not be reached for comment. James Petrie and his father Ed Petrie, of Compass, repped Morton. Douglas Elliman brokers Kyle Rosko and Marcy Braun had the listing.
