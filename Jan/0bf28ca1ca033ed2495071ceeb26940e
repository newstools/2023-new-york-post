A perv made sexual advances toward a 17-year-old girl in Brooklyn — and threatened to hurt her when she rebuffed him, cops said. The sicko started chatting with the teen on East 22nd Street near Duryea Place in Flatbush around 11:20 p.m. Wednesday and asked her for oral sex, police said Friday. When the teen refused the advances, the creep “made verbal threats to harm her,” police said. The teen was able to flee to safety and was not hurt, cops said. The suspect fled south on East 22nd Street in a gray four-door sedan, police said. He is shown in surveillance photos released by the NYPD early Friday wearing a blue hoodie, white pants and a black du-rag. Cops are still looking to track him down.
