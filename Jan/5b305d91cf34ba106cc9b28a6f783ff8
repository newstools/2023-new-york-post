At least seven people were injured when a roof over a pool at a hot springs in Idaho collapsed, police said. The roof collapsed at the privately-owned Givens Hot Springs around 1:45 p.m. on Saturday while multiple patrons were in the geothermal pool, the Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office said. Six patients were transported to local hospitals via ambulance while at least one other person was taken by private vehicle, according to police. The patients — who ranged from ages 9 to 70 —  suffered lacerations and injuries to the head, shoulder and extremities. They were all in stable condition and conscious when they were taken to the hospital, cops said. Police said that the cause of the roof collapse is not known, however, it “appears to be structural,” as there was no snow in the area at the time. Givens Hot Springs is a recreation facility that includes an indoor geothermal swimming pool, event center, and camping area located about a half hour away from Boise. “Due to a structural issue, we are closed at present,” its website said Saturday. “ Please check back on this site for future updates. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
