The NFL has angered Joe Mixon again. The Bengals running back was not happy when he was asked about the NFL selling tickets to a neutral site AFC Championship Game on Wednesday. “I mean, to be honest, it’s disrespectful,” Mixon told WCPO’s Marshall Kramsky. “We’re not worried about that s–t. We’ve got a game to play on Sunday, right? So you can’t count us out. “We’ve got a game to play on Sunday. All this stuff, that don’t mean s–t. We’re gonna go out there on Sunday and do what the hell we gotta do to get that [win], then we’re gonna see what they’re talking about.” On Wednesday, tickets for a potential neutral-site AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills in Atlanta went on sale. The Chiefs host the Jaguars in Saturday’s Divisional Round game. Should the Bengals or the Jaguars advance, the higher seed would host the conference title game. The Bengals face the Bills in the AFC Divisional Round playoff game on Sunday — 20 days after their Week 17 matchup was cut short in the first quarter and eventually cancelled after Buffalo safety Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest on the field. Hamlin was released from the hospital and has spent time with teammates as they make their playoff run. Mixon’s comments came after he previously expressed his frustration with the NFL’s handling of the playoff format. The running back was frustrated that the NFL decided the AFC North Division would be decided by a coin flip if the Bengals had lost to the Ravens in Week 18. Cincinnati’s win in the finale made the NFL’s ruling moot. Last Friday, Mixon challenged the NFL to pay his fine for a coin-flip celebration during that Week 18 win. The Bengals would defeat the Ravens again 24-17 in the wild-card round to set up the matchup with the Bills.
