The Red Sox are replenishing their infield. Boston acquired shortstop Adalberto Mondesi from the Kansas City Royals for left-handed reliever Josh Taylor on Tuesday, The Post’s Jon Heyman confirmed. The deal also includes a player to be named later going to the Red Sox. The 27-year-old Mondesi is recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee that sidelined him for the 2022 season. Taylor also missed last season with back issues. The move comes after the Red Sox lost Xander Bogaerts to the Padres in free agency, with the shortstop inking an 11-year, $280 million deal with San Diego. They’re also currently without second baseman Trevor Story, who earlier this month underwent internal bracing surgery on the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. Mondesi, who made his MLB debut with the Royals in 2016, has also dealt with a series of injuries throughout his career — including a right shoulder impingement, a groin strain, a pair of left shoulder subluxations, a left hamstring strain, and an oblique strain — that has limited him to 358 games across seven seasons. Before that, Mondesi was on track to become one of the league’s brightest stars with his power and speed, having led the league in steals with 24 in the shortened COVID-19 60-game season in 2020. The move comes after the Royals traded center fielder Michael A. Taylor to Minnesota on Monday. Per ESPN, Enrique Hernandez, who has played center field for the Red Sox the past two seasons, is likely to take over at shortstop, a position he has played 100 games at. While Mondesi has spent the bulk of his career at short, he does have experience at second and third. Kansas City also has spoken with teams about utilityman Hunter Dozier and infielder Nicky Lopez, according to ESPN.
