An average golfer got an invite to the most exclusive golf tournament in the world. A man by the name of Scott Stallings said he received an official invite to The Masters recently that was clearly intended for the PGA Tour pro of the same name. The man reached out to Stallings, who is the 54th-ranked golfer in the world, and explained how this possibly could have come to be. “Hi Scott,” the man wrote. “My name is Scott Stallings as well and I’m from [Georgia]. My wife’s name is Jennifer too! … I received a FedEx today from the Masters inviting me to play in the Masters Tournament April 6-9, 2023. I’m [100%] sure this is NOT for me. I play but wow! [Nowhere] near your level.” Stallings’ best finish at Augusta was in 2012 when he finished tied for 27th. Stallings, 37, has not played in the event since 2014 but qualified this year, thanks to reaching the field for The Tour Championship at the end of last season. “Literally had been checking the mailbox five times a day and then I got this random DM yesterday,” Stallings wrote on Twitter. He will be the one teeing it up at the tournament in April, now that the invite will presumably find its way to him. “It’s a very nice package complete with everything needed to attend,” the man wrote. “I think we have some confusion because of our names, our wife’s names and geographical location.”
