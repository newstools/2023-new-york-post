A toast to the “Table of Ex-Boyfriends!” One savage bride seated all her former lovers at one table during her wedding reception in Hubei, China on Jan. 8, according to a local report. The viral video with 2.91 million views on Weibo, one of China’s biggest social media apps, shows five men and two women at a round table, awkwardly passing wine bottles to drown them out of their misery. Guests wondered why she would involve her exes on such a magical day, but the bride wanted the men to “see what they’re missing.” If it wasn’t bad enough that the men were seated together in the 37-second clip, the bride took it a step further and labeled a sign “Table of Ex-Boyfriends” in Chinese. Moping the night away, the men were well-behaved and respectful, according to other wedding-goers. Many viewers found it ironic how similar the bride’s ex-boyfriends look, clearly showing she has a type. “How did the bride manage to gather so many guys that closely resemble another?” one person commented. While another person joked, “It’s not hard to figure out what her husband looks like.” One viewer was shocked the men even went, “Not only does the bride dare to invite them, this group [of men] also dared to attend.” The humiliated ex-boyfriends will surely have second thoughts the next time an ex-girlfriend invites them to their wedding.
