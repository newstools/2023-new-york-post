Michigan co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was placed on leave while the university investigates an alleged computer access crime in December, according to multiple reports. The investigation is reportedly related to a complaint at Schembechler Hall, Michigan football’s practice facility. Law enforcement officials also reportedly conducted an investigation at Weiss’ home on Jan. 10. Weiss is said to be uninvolved with Michigan’s recruiting activities while the investigation is ongoing. Weiss was with the team during the Fiesta Bowl against TCU on New Year’s Eve. “The University of Michigan Police Department is investigating a report of computer access crimes that occurred at Schembechler Hall during Dec. 21 through the 23rd of 2022,” university deputy police chief Crystal James said in a statement to the Detroit News. “Since this is an ongoing investigation, there is no additional information to share.” Weiss provided a statement to ESPN: “I am aware of the ongoing investigation by the University of Michigan Police Department and fully cooperating with investigators. I look forward to the matter being resolved. Out of respect for the integrity of the investigation, I will not have any further comment.” Weiss joined Jim Harbaugh’s staff before the 2021 college football season. He had previously held various roles under Jim’s brother, John Harbaugh, with the Baltimore Ravens for 12 years. Weiss also served as a graduate assistant on Jim’s Stanford football teams from 2005-08.
