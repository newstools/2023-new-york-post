Father knows best. After months of speculation, Beyonce‘s dad, Matthew Knowles, leaked to TMZ in an interview that his daughter is planning a tour and she’ll announce it when she’s ready. The interview came in the wake of Queen Bey’s controversial concert in Dubai. This gig raised eyebrows from fans because Knowles accepted $24 million to perform in a country known for its openly anti-LGBTQ+ laws. Matthew Knowles said that this issue is a non-starter and suggested that his daughter was simply “uniting a diverse crowd and bringing people together.” He added that she stands for inclusiveness and would never do anything to hurt anyone. Knowles’ mother refused to comment on the concert, though. “I’m not gonna talk about that,” she told the TMZ reporter trailing her in what appeared to be a U.S. airport. As for when a potential “Renaissance” Tour will touch down on U.S. soil is anyone’s guess. Beyonce’s last tour in the U.S. was the Formation World Tour which concluded at East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium on Oct. 7, 2016. As for a Destiny’s Child reunion, Matthew Knowles shut down any rumors of the trio getting back together. “Not happening,” he told TMZ in August 2021. At the time of publication, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams don’t have solo tours in the works either.  Although Beyonce didn’t perform any tracks from her 2022 record “Renaissance” at the Jan. 23 show, she was able to cram in several hits from her expansive catalogue as well as a few covers into her 17-song set. Here’s her set list (courtesy of SetList.FM): 01.) “At Last” (Harry Warren cover; made famous by Etta James) 02.) “XO” (from her 2014 album “Beyonce”) 03.) “Flaws And All” (from her 2007 album “B’Day”) 04.) “Ava Maria” (from her 2008 album “I Am Sasha Fierce”) 05.) “Halo” (from her 2008 album “I Am Sasha Fierce”) 06.) “Brown Skin Girl” featuring Blue Ivy Carter (from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 07.) “Be Alive” (from the 2021 “King Richard” soundtrack) 08.) “Otherside” (from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 09.) “Bigger” from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 10.) “Spirit” from the 2019 “Lion King Soundtrack”) 11.) “Freedom” (from her 2016 album “Lemonade”) 12.) “I Care” (from her 2011 album “4”) 13.) “Beautiful Liar” (from her 2007 album “B’Day”) 14.) “Crazy In Love” (from her 2003 album “Dangerously In Love”) 15.) “Countdown” (from her 2011 album “4”) 16.) “Naughty Girl” (from her 2003 album “Dangerously In Love”) 17.) “Drunk In Love” (from her 2014 album “Beyonce”)  Beyonce’s seventh studio album “Renaissance,” netted nine Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Dance/Electronic Recording, Best Dance/Electronic Album, Best R&B Performance, Best Traditional R&B Performance, Best R&B Song and Best Song Written For Visual Media. The nine nominations tie Beyonce with her husband Jay Z for most all-time Grammy nominations with 88 apiece.
