Dave Blezow makes his NFL Week 16 picks for Saturday’s games. All lines courtesy of BetMGM. Last week I faded the Raiders for pulling the plug on Derek Carr, and all Jarrett Stidham did was throw for 365 yards in a 37-34 overtime loss to the 49ers. Chiefs need a win to be in position to gain the AFC No. 1 seed and bye, pending a decision by the NFL on what it will do with the unfinished Bills-Bengals game. K.C. doesn’t need to win by double digits, though, and its 4-11-1 ATS record makes this a hard number to lay in a rivalry game. This game is for the AFC South title, though the Jaguars could lose and still sneak in as a wild card if the Patriots, Dolphins and Steelers were all to lose. The Titans are deficient at quarterback with Josh Dobbs, but will be getting Derrick Henry and some key defensive players back. Love getting big points in a game in which both coaches will be thrilled to win on a last-second field goal.
