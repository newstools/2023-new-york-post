A man was arrested Thursday for allegedly beating a bouncer to death outside a Chelsea bar on Christmas Eve, cops said. Earl Gumbs, 34, was nabbed and manslaughter and assault charges were pending against him, cops said. Bouncer Duane Patterson, 61, was working at Billymark’s West Bar on Ninth Avenue near West 29th Street when he and a man inside began brawling around 3 a.m. Dec. 24, cops said. The fight spilled outside, where the suspect slugged Patterson in the face, knocking him to the ground, and causing him to strike his head. A bartender found him unconscious and called 911. Patterson, of Fort George, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, and spent several days in a coma before he died, cops and family said. “Duane suffered a traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for four days,” his daughter, Arianna Buchholz, said in a GoFundMe post. “The intensive care he received was unfortunately not enough to revive his mind,” she wrote. “The family is in need of emotional and financial support during this devastating time.” Buchholz described her dad — who was an organ donor — as “such a strong, honorable person” who “was always quick to make us laugh.”
