A University of Alabama basketball player was arrested for the shooting death of a woman near the Tuscaloosa campus early Sunday. Darius Miles, 21, was busted along with 20-year-old Michael Lynn Davis for allegedly opening fire at a car in an area near campus known as “The Strip” around 1:45 a.m., the local ABC News affiliate station reported. One of the passengers, 23-year-old passenger Jamea Jonae Harris, was struck by a bullet and died, cops said. One of the suspects was struck by a bullet and injured when someone in the other car opened fire. It was not clear which suspect was shot. Investigators believed the two parties had gotten into a minor argument along The Strip before the bullets flew. Miles, who is from Washington DC, is a junior at the University of Alabama and played forward for the school’s basketball team. He was reportedly benched during the team’s game against Louisiana State University Saturday due to an ankle injury. The university kicked Miles off the team following the news of his murder arrest, it said in a statement. “We were made aware of the recent charge against student-athlete Darius Miles; he has been removed from campus and is no longer a member of the Alabama men’s basketball team,” the university said. The school is also offering counseling services for students. Neither Harris nor Davis are affiliated with the university.
