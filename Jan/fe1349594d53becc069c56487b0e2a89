A 16-year-old boy was stabbed during a broad-daylight fight on a Brooklyn street, cops said Wednesday. The teen was knifed in the torso around 3 p.m. Tuesday outside a laundromat at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street in Sunset Park, police said. He was taken to NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn with non-life-threatening injuries, cops said. Police believe the teen knew his attackers, who fled after the stabbing. The incident came hours after a 17-year-old boy was knifed twice in the back on 34th Avenue near Parsons Boulevard in Flushing, cops said. A group of seven teen boys ran off in an unknown direction after the stabbing, police said.
