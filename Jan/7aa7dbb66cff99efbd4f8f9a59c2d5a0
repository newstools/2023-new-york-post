Paulina Gretzky kicked off the new year in glamorous fashion. On Saturday, the wife of golfer Dustin Johnson posted a collection of snaps from her New Year’s Eve celebrations, which included an intimate dinner that boasted masquerade masks and plenty of bubbly. In one photo, Gretzky — who recently celebrated her 34th birthday — is seen modeling a sleek silver mini dress as she posed next to gal pals while a tuxedo-clad Johnson, 38, sat at the table wearing a mask in another. Gretzky, the daughter of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, also posted a video of the group toasting with champagne flutes. The past year was filled with life-changing moments for Gretzky and Johnson. In April of 2022, the longtime couple swapped vows at the luxurious Blackberry Farm in Tennessee, where they were joined by friends and family, including their sons, Tatum, 7, and River, 5. In the weeks following the wedding, Johnson exited the PGA Tour in favor of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. He reportedly received “around” $125 million to make the leap to the controversial league. “I chose what’s best for me and my family,” Johnson said in June 2022. Johnson became the captain of LIV Golf’s 4 Aces GC squad and teamed up with Patrick Reed, Talor Gooch, and Pat Perez. During LIV Golf’s inaugural season, Johnson earned more than $35 million in winnings. The former Masters champion will return to the course in early 2023 when LIV Golf’s Mayakoba event gets underway in Mexico.
