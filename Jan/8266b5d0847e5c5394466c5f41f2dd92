If you talk to any mom, they’ll tell you that an awesome diaper bag is key to making motherhood just a tad easier. Sure, you could use any random tote of your liking to hold all of your baby’s essentials but with a diaper bag, they’ll include convenient features like insulated pockets for bottles, built-in changing mats and supportive shoulder straps, just to name a few. No matter what age your baby may be, whether you’re toting around things for an infant or a toddler (diapers, snacks, toys, pacifiers, Water Wipes, a change of clothes — you get the point) just about everything in that “Mary Poppins” bag will become essential to everyday life.
