Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau doesn’t want Quentin Grimes to hesitate in firing from the outside, even as the team’s starting shooting guard has missed 15 of 20 3-point attempts in his last three appearances. “Don’t overthink it,” Thibodeau said when asked about Grimes after Saturday’s loss to the Nets. “You’re open, shoot. You’re guarded, move it, make a play. It’s an instinctive game. You want rhythm and you want to create rhythm for your teammates “He’s proven to be a good shooter in this league. Guys are going to go through different things. But if you’re open, his teammates want him to shoot, we want him to shoot. He’ll be fine.” Since becoming a full-time starter on Nov. 20, the 22-year-old Grimes is averaging 11.7 points and shooting 35.9 percent from 3-point distance in 34.0 minutes per game over 34 appearances. Retired Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was in attendance at Saturday’s game at Barclays Center to watch former players RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish of the Knicks, as well as Kyrie Irving and Seth Curry of the Nets. “For sure, great seeing Coach K. Love that guy, man. Any time he’s around, gotta show him some love,” Barrett said. “I saw him in the summer. I went down to Duke. He meant so much [to me]. That’s a coach who really cares about you on and off the court. Puts you in a position to succeed. He’s also tough on you when you need it. He’s just a great human being, overall. I think that’s why he’s so loved.” Thibodeau on his technical foul in the first quarter of Saturday’s game for arguing with the officials: “I just felt, I think it was 10-4 at that point and I thought we got hammered on two straight plays. It’s not an easy game to officiate. I understand that. There’s going to be marginal calls that can go either way. … To me, I don’t care how the game’s called. I just want it to be consistent.”
