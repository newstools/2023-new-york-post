A dolled-up Cardi B got off easy in Queens court Tuesday when she missed the deadline on the community-service sentence she landed for a wild strip-club brawl — and the judge simply pushed it back. The “Bodak Yellow’’ rapper stunned in an all-white designer ensemble featuring an oversized full-length fur coat, skin-tight sleeveless jersey dress, Christian Dior sunglasses and Louboutin spiked heels, complimented by roughly 5-inch maroon nails. The flamboyant Bronx-raised defendant, 30, was in court for failing to complete 15 days of community service by Tuesday. The barely two weeks of service was required as part of the plea deal she copped in September for hurling a hookah at two bartender sisters during a 2018 fight at a Queens strip joint and ordering a buddy to attack one of them for supposedly sleeping with her husband. “These [court extensions] are not uncommon,’’ the “WAP” rapper’s lawyer, Drew Findling, insisted to The Post by phone Tuesday. “Cardi is constantly performing community service at community events. Recently, she has been spending more time in Los Angeles, even in New York, with her back-to-school efforts. “She speaks at community centers, pledged and wrote a $100,000 check for her former middle school in The Bronx. We just asked for an extension, and the judge granted it.” He added that the hip-hop star will begin her required community service in Queens this week. Hours before her court appearance, Cardi tweeted a reference to masturbation. The Queens District Attorney’s Office only said in a statement, “The judge convened a compliance hearing. “Defendant must complete community service by March 1.” Cardi, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almanza, initially faced 12 charges including two felony counts of attempted assault in the attack at the Flushing club.
