Ohio sports bettors are in luck, as the first day of the new year is jam-packed with action. One of the best games on the Week 17 slate is the rivalry game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Ravens have managed to say afloat without star quarterback Lamar Jackson for the past few weeks. Notably, they defeated this Pittsburgh team 16-14 just three weeks ago. However, this second meeting may look very different as Baltimore could have Jackson back, and his rushing mate J.K. Dobbins appears to be in prime form. With all that being said, the market has come in heavily on the Steelers. Pittsburgh is fresh off a victory against the Raiders and has the ability to keep this one tight. Although, the status of Jackson could swing this spread dramatically. New players only, 21+. Available in AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, LA, MI, NJ, NY, PA, TN, OH, VA, and WV only. Full T&C apply.
