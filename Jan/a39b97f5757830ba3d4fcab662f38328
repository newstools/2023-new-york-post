Derek Wolfe, a former NFL defensive lineman and Super Bowl champion, slayed a massive mountain lion in Colorado. Wolfe, who played eight seasons for the Broncos before one year with the Ravens in an NFL career that wrapped up in 2020, wrote on Instagram that he was enlisted to hunt the beast after it was “wreaking havoc” around the Rocky Mountains and killing local dogs and deer. “*Predator Control*  Late Tuesday night I got a call from @huntnest to see if I wanted to stalk a giant Tom (male mountain lion) who has been wreaking havoc in a rural neighborhood,” Wolfe wrote. “He had already killed two of her dogs and was living under her porch, nervous what he might do next. We found a fresh 4×4 mule deer he had just killed. We hiked straight up 2500ft and down the other side, then back up again, back down the other side and then back up again to 9600ft. “Exhausted, dehydrated, cramping I drew back my @hoytbowhunting and sent an @sevrbroadheads through him. Then I had to crawl backwards down the mountain with him to get him to the truck I fell 10ft off a rock face on the way down lol. Any guess how big this thing was?” Considering Wolfe is listed at 6-foot-5, this mountain lion could easily have been over seven feet long. Most of the commenters on Wolfe’s post were impressed with the hunting feat. Former UFC fighter Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone commented, “Big ole boy.” Wolfe’s former Broncos teammate, Chad Kelly, weighed in: “Shessssshhhh.” Former NFL safety T.J. Ward added, “Need my winter coat” with a laughing emoji. Not everyone was happy with Wolfe, who is currently a sports talk radio host at 104.3 the Fan in Denver. One commenter wrote, “Or did a neighborhood wreak havoc on the lions habitat and it’s now just trying to survive.” A Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson told TMZ that Wolfe followed proper protocols in killing the beast legally.
