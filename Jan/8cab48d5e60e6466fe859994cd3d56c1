Brendan Fraser is ready for another hefty paycheck. The actor said he’s very much open to the idea of a reboot of “The Mummy” after he helmed the role of adventurer Rick O’Connell in three of the films from 1999 to 2008. “Gosh, I don’t know any juicy details about it, but it’s kinda been an open-ended question for some time now,” Fraser told Deadline. “I’m not opposed to it. I don’t know an actor who doesn’t want a job.” “I don’t think I’ve been this famous and unsalaried at the same time in my professional life, so sign me up,” the 54-year-old added, joking, “We’ve all got to start somewhere.” In 2017, Tom Cruise landed Fraser’s role in a “Mummy” reboot but the “George of the Jungle” star said the film missed the mark, calling it a “straight-ahead horror.” “It is hard to make that movie,” Fraser said. “The ingredient that we had going for our ‘Mummy,’ which I didn’t see in that film, was fun. That was what was lacking in that incarnation.” “It was too much of a straight-ahead horror movie. ‘The Mummy’ should be a thrill ride, but not terrifying and scary,” he continued. “I know how difficult it is to pull it off. I tried to do it three times.” Cruise’s version wasn’t a massive hit with critics. Still, it grossed $410 million worldwide — but lost $95 million due to high production and marketing costs. Fraser — who took a years-long break from Hollywood — has come back with all guns blazing with “The Whale.” The Darren Aronofsky flick follows a 600-pound man attempting to reconnect with his estranged daughter.
