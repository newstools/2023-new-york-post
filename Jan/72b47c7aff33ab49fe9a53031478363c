Damar Hamlin is back in the building. The Bills safety, who suffered cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during a game against the Bengals on Jan. 2., is seemingly back in the team’s facilities in Orchard Park. Linebacker Matt Milano posted a photo on his Instagram story Saturday afternoon of Hamlin appearing to greet teammates, smiling and standing up on his own. The post was captioned with an angel emoji. The Associated Press, citing an anonymous source, later confirmed that Hamlin visited the team facility Saturday. The 24-year-old Hamlin was discharged from the Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute on Wednesday, the Bills announced. He had previously been transferred from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center earlier in the week after showing remarkable progress. During the first quarter of the Bills-Bengals “Monday Night Football” matchup, Hamlin, despite initially getting back to his feet, fell back to the ground after making a seemingly routine tackle of Tee Higgins. He was administered CPR and shocked on the field, and rushed to the hospital by ambulance in critical condition. The game was canceled and subsequently ruled a no contest. In their first game since the incident, the Bills routed the Patriots 35-23 to secure the No. 2 seed in the AFC. Buffalo’s Nyheim Hines returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in the game, including on the opening play of the game. The Bills are heavily favored in their wild-card round clash against the Dolphins on Sunday.
