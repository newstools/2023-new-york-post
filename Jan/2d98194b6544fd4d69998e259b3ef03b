Frankie Montas and the Yankees avoided arbitration by agreeing to a $7.5 million deal before Friday’s deadline. The right-hander had a disastrous start to his Yankees tenure after being traded from the A’s prior to last year’s trade deadline, coming off a shoulder injury with Oakland that plagued him again in the latter part of the year. Montas pitched to a 6.35 ERA in eight starts with the Yankees before being shut down again with shoulder woes. He returned in diminished form to pitch out of the bullpen in the ALCS and pitched just one inning in relief against the Astros. The Yankees made another major addition to their rotation this offseason by signing Carlos Rodon to a six-year, $162 million deal and he’ll slot behind Gerrit Cole. The team picked up Luis Severino’s $15 million option and also has Nestor Cortes coming back, along with Domingo German and Clarke Schmidt as depth. Kyle Higashioka agreed to a deal worth $1.46 million, The Post’s Jon Heyman reported.
