The Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins took a trip through time on their way to Fenway Park for the NHL Winter Classic. The Bruins, before scoring twice in the third to defeat the Penguins 2-1, showed up in vintage Red Sox uniforms with bats and gloves to go along with their look. Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron even brought a tarred bat given to him from former Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek. “They look very legit,” Red Sox infielder Kiké Hernandez told NHL.com. “I’m hoping we get uniforms like that and do some sort of throwback. Those uniforms were really cool for sure.” The Penguins weren’t to be outdone, however, and rolled up to the stadium in 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates throwback uniforms. Penguins goalie Tristan Jarry even went the extra step to don catcher’s gear for his entrance. According to Penguins coach Mike Sullivan, the throwback outfits were not a combined effort between the two teams, but a fitting way for the squads to show up. “We did not coordinate with the Bruins, at least it’s not my understanding that we did,” Sullivan said. “I think it’s really appropriate, and in an event like this, in such an iconic stadium, in a lot of ways I think it’s appropriate because it gives us an opportunity to tip our hat to all the great players and great teams that have played in this stadium over the years. And for me, I think it’s just part of the entertainment value, but I know our players were excited about it, and I’m sure Boston was as well.” Bruins coach Jim Montgomery was equally excited about the teams suiting up in the baseball gear, saying how special it makes the event feel. “‘Field of Dreams’ and a combination of ‘Eight Men Out,’ ” Montgomery said. “The guys walked out in vintage Red Sox outfits and, again, you come back to how lucky we are to be at such a great event.” This is the second Winter Classic to be held at Fenway Park, the first being in 2010 where the Bruins beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1.
