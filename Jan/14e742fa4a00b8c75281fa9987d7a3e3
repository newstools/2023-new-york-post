Grading the Jets’ 11-6 loss to the Dolphins in the season finale on Sunday. Another week without a touchdown. The Jets’ offense struggled again and did not reach the end zone for the third straight week. They gained 187 yards and just 38 rushing yards. QB Joe Flacco (18 of 33, 149 yards, 66.4 QB rating) was under siege behind a leaky offensive line. WR Garrett Wilson (9 catches, 89 yards) seemed to be the only player on offense making plays. The running game was nonexistent. Grade: F This one is graded on a curve because the Jets faced rookie QB Skylar Thompson (20 of 31, 152 yards, 76.3 rating). Yes, they did not give up a touchdown and held the Dolphins down for most of the day, but they still were not dominant. They only sacked Thompson once and did not have any takeaways again. With how poorly the offense has played, the Jets needed the defense to create some turnovers and perhaps even score. WR Tyreek Hill (2 catches, 23 yards) was a non-factor. Grade: B- Punter Braden Mann had a good game with four punts inside the 20. PR Braxton Berrios had a 20-yard return to set up good field position for the Jets on one possession. Kicker Greg Zuerlein was again the only Jet who scored, making 2 of 3 field-goal attempts. Grade: B The Jets have looked like a dead team for weeks. That is not a good look for Robert Saleh. They played better Sunday than they did in the previous two weeks but it still was not good. Offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur is on the hot seat. The offense was terrible again Sunday. There are injuries but it is hard to excuse away everything that is going on with the offense. Where is the creativity? Calling a run on third-and-14 in the red zone is inexcusable. Grade: F
