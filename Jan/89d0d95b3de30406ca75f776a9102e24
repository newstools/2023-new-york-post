This is some fishy fashion. Fresh off the bizarre BDSM teddy bear scandal, Balenciaga is angling to hook fashionistas with its newest offering: fisherman-style waders that stretch up to your waist. Unlike the version found in a sporting goods store, these are made of calfskin and have an eye-popping price tag of $3,490. Part of the luxury label’s winter collection, these statement-making boots are more appropriate for cosmopolitan city sidewalks than fly fishing in Montana. “It’s not exactly what you’d wear to do the weekly shop at Tesco,” one shopper joked to Jam Press, referring to the British supermarket chain. “But I’m sure some people will fall hook, line and sinker for them.” They are made in Italy, feature a pointed toe and can be wiped clean with a soft cloth, according to the brand’s site, which described them as: “Waders 110mm Over-The-Knee Boot in matte black calfskin is in several looks of the Balenciaga’s Winter 22 Collection, 360° Show.” The storied fashion house, which was founded by Cristobal Balenciaga in San Sebastian, Spain, in 1919 and moved to Paris during the Spanish Civil War, has long been a favorite of European elites and A-list celebrities. The brand’s creative director Demna Gvasalia is known for his edgy, envelope pushing creations, however that approach has landed the brand in hot water. In November, an ad campaign featuring children with teddy bears clad in dominatrix gear sparked a public outcry, mea culpas and a financial fallout. The brand apologized for the photos and sued the producers of the ad, but later dropped the $25 million lawsuit.
