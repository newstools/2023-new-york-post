It was non-cents-ical. One of the UK’s biggest lottery winners burned through a mind-blowing $50 million in eight years — splurging on a soccer team, race horses and extravagant cars — before his luck ran out, documents revealed Thursday. Colin Weir, of North Ayrshire, Scotland, spent a stunning $131,000 per week after winning a record-breaking $257.6 million EuroMillions jackpot in 2011, according to The Independent. Weir, a former cameraman married to a nurse, bought a 55 percent share in Glasgow’s Partick Thistle Football Club before he died of sepsis at age 72 in 2019, the outlet reported. The big spender also plunked down big bucks for a vintage Bentley Arnage, Jaguar F-Pace SUV, a Mercedes-Benz E Class Estate, according to The Independent. Along with a $6 million home he reportedly spent millions more to renovate, Weir also snapped up three prized racing thoroughbreds, including an Irish mare named If You Say Run. But the lottery curse reared its head in 2018, when he divorced his wife, Chris, after nearly four decades of marriage — and she took much of his fortune, according to The Independent. All told, Weir ended up spending an average of $131,900 per week on luxury items and investments before suffering from the kidney failure that led to his death. At the time he won the lottery, he was the second-biggest EuroMillions winner ever.
