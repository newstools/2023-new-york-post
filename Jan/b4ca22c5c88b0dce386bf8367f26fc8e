Live like a modern pharaoh — for less. Pyramid House on Fire Island, which is on the market for $6.5 million, is now also available as a summer rental. The home is asking $325,000 for the season. If that’s too much, you can rent it for $100,000 in June, $125,000 in July and $125,000 for August. For those with smaller pocketbooks, it can also be rented for $946 a night on Airbnb. The commute back and forth from the city is also easier than dealing with all the Hamptons traffic. The modestly sized home at 443 Sail Walk is 2,100 square feet — and comes with three bedrooms, 2½ baths and sits on 0.18 acres. Though the midcentury-style home is small, it is fierce, built in 1961 and renovated in 2006 by architect Hal Hayes. The house is anchored by a great room with a high ceiling and a wall of glass in the living room, kitchen and dining room — overlooking the dunes, ocean and bay. The main bedroom comes with a dressing room, a large bathroom and a private study. There’s a pool, a hot tub and three small pyramids (two guest rooms and a shared bath) in the backyard. The home also features two fireplaces and multiple decks. It was originally built by the Argentine architect Julio Kaufman for a nephew of J.P. Morgan — and later owned by film and Broadway writer Paul Rudnick, of “Sister Act,” “Addams Family Values” and “In & Out.” The listing broker, Brown Harris Stevens’ Glenn Rice, is also the current owner.
