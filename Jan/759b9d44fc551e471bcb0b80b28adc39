Always leave your DNA behind. That’s the wisdom one woman is dishing out to fellow females who might feel unsafe when traveling solo in rideshares and taxis. Spooked riders should always leave definitive physical evidence that they were indeed in the vehicle, said TikTok user @brennalina, just in case something horrific should happen. For the clever TikToker, that includes leaving strands of hair, as well as finger prints. “Ever since a girl on TikTok said she leaves hair and fingerprints in all her Ubers, I leave hair and fingerprints in all my Ubers,” she said in a recent post. She then captioned it, “Ladies amirite — #LoveBeingAWoman.” The secondhand safety advice not only racked up a whopping 27.5 million views — it also sparked a lively discussion, with traumatized women sharing their harrowing rideshare experiences. “I had an Uber driver lock me in his car until I gave him five stars and a nice comment,” one said. Another woman claimed she had been abducted by a driver. “I got kidnapped … he took me to a field … somehow I talked and manipulated my way out of it by being nice to him,” she said. Others offered more safety tips. “I always pretend I’m on the phone with someone as I enter. I’ll usually be like, ‘Okay I’m getting in the Uber I’ll send you my location love you bye,’” one commenter wrote. Another added: “Uber is literally all the things our parents warned us about — I don’t understand this at all.”
