Steve Cohen seemingly sees an end in sight. The Mets’ negotiations with Carlos Correa have now dragged on for over two weeks since they agreed to a 12-year, $315 million middle-of-the-night deal. After the star infielder’s deal with the Giants broke down over physical concerns, the Mets quickly swooped in and reached an agreement. The Mets’ own physical brought similar concerns over Correa’s surgically-repaired right ankle, however, and the two sides have since been engaged in negotiations over how to proceed. “While I can’t speak on the player, I do believe we’ll have a resolution soon one way or the other,” Cohen told Tyler Ward, a Mets YouTuber, at a Citi Field event on Saturday. Much of the discussion has been about contract language the Mets believe is required to mitigate their injury risk, according to The Post’s Jon Heyman. The Mets have been intent on adding protections to the original contract, per Heyman, making part of the $315 million less than fully guaranteed if Correa were to miss a certain amount of time due to the concern. Correa is unlikely to be willing to change the original figures — 12 years, $315 million — and amid discussions of injury clauses, Correa’s agent, Scott Boras, has reached out to at least one other team, Heyman reported Thursday. Despite the “hiccup” on Thursday, both Correa and the Mets appear to have strong mutual interest to complete the deal with each other. After two teams flagged the same concern, Correa likely wouldn’t find a bigger offer on the open market if he backs out. And the Mets don’t have many other options of Correa’s caliber to sign, with Cohen notably telling Heyman “we needed one more thing, and this is it,” after originally agreeing to terms.
