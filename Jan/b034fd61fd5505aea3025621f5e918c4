An ex-con who served time for attempted murder has been arrested for allegedly stabbing a man to death during a spat over a parking spot — the city’s first homicide of 2023, police said Wednesday. Ira Shane, 52, is accused of fatally knifing 63-year-old Sergio Garcia shortly before 4 a.m. New Year’s Day. He was nabbed Tuesday afternoon after a witness came forward to police, cops said. Shane was charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, authorities said. Garcia was stabbed along with a 38-year-old woman in front of a building on College Avenue near East 170th Street in Claremont Village, the Bronx, cops said. “They were involved in an altercation with an unknown group over parking,” a law enforcement source told The Post at the time. “This guy got killed over a parking spot.” The wounded pair showed up at Bronx Lebanon Hospital, with Garcia pronounced dead and the woman listed in stable condition, cops said. Shane was convicted of attempted murder in 1989 and paroled in 2010, state corrections records show. His parole expired four months later.
