You should work out in what you feel are comfortable clothes — but gymgoers claim one woman is making them uncomfortable with her teeny, tiny gym attire. TikTok user Sarah Caus regularly posts her workouts online. However, it’s not her routine that has people talking, but rather her skimpy bottoms. In one clip — viewed over 4.3 million times — she dons a small black crop top and small green bottoms, filming herself walking up the gym stairs and into the weight room where she begins her workout. Caus often works out in barely-there booty shorts, with her videos amassing thousands of comments from people aghast at her outfit choices. “Honestly. Show some class,” one woman wrote. “She looks absolutely amazing, but this is not ok,” said another, while someone else jokingly asked, “is she going to the beach?” Other users mocked the active woman’s choice of outfit, telling her she was dressing that way purely for attention. “They looking at me” one joked, with another adding: “I don’t get enough [attention] at home.” Others questioned the gym’s dress code. “I don’t think my gym would let me in wearing that,” said a follower, while another helpfully commented: “Miss you forgot something.” Workout gear is a contentious topic, with TikTokers often criticized for baring skin as they get their workout in. Late last year, an avid gymgoer said she was told by the owner of her women-only gym that she was making other members “uncomfortable” with her derrière-enhancing leggings and was told to not wear them. However, TikTok users assured her there was nothing to worry about. “Find a new gym that doesn’t have moral police. You look amazing,” a user chimed in. “Gym owner here. Nothing wrong with what you’re wearing. Only thing that’s wrong is their insecurities.”
