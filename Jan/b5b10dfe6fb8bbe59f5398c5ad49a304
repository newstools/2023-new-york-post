This mom deserves a bronze medal. TikTok user @opie_theasianshepherd revealed in a video posted days ago that although she was in labor with painful contractions, making sure she had a nice tan was a bigger priority than packing a bag for the hospital. In the video, which has gained traction with over 91,000 views, the new mother showed herself cradling her baby along with the caption: “Thinking about 3 weeks ago when I started contracting bad and realized I was in labor and rather than make sure I had my stuff ready for the hospital I fake tanned so I looked prettier when giving birth.” But even with a nice glow at the hospital, the mom said that she still looked like a “mess” when giving birth. In the comments section, some users seemed to be inspired by the new mom’s commitment to her beauty regimen. “Honestly, goals,” one viewer wrote. Another agreed, typing, “Queen.” Other TikTok users even tagged their friends in her post and wrote, “This will be me hahahaa.” Jokes aside, it doesn’t seem like Opie was alone in wanting to look glam while in labor. A few parents commented that they tanned or did other beauty treatments before leaving to give birth. “I was straightening my hair and applying makeup with contractions 3 mins apart,” one person wrote, accompanied by a crying-laughing emoji. “Got to be done!” Another chimed in, “Ahahaha I did this, and got my lashes done too.” In a previous video on her page, the new mom cradled her newborn son in the hospital bed. In the video, he wore a green knitted hat with a pom-pom on the top, and she kissed him and held his hand.
