Prince Harry has more tea to spill. In a new interview with The Telegraph published Friday, the Duke of Sussex, 38, revealed that he has enough content to write even more books about his experience growing up as a royal, as he cut out nearly half his content from the first draft. “The first draft was different,” he told The Telegraph’s Bryony Gordon. “It was 800 pages, and now it’s down to 400 pages. It could have been two books, put it that way. And the hard bit was taking things out.” Harry also revealed that a lot of content was cut out of his new memoir, “Spare,” as he feared it would cause an unrepairable rift with his brother, Prince William, and father, King Charles III. “There are some things that have happened, especially between me and my brother, and to some extent between me and my father, that I just don’t want the world to know,” the Duke said. “Because I don’t think they would ever forgive me.” This interview comes days after his memoir was released, which included bombshells about his entire family, as he claimed that his older brother William “attacked him” in 2019 and even shared hostile text message conversations between his wife, Meghan Markle, and Princess Kate Middleton. The royal’s new memoir sold a record 1.4 million copies across the UK, US and Canada on Tuesday, its first day of publication, according to The Telegraph. In December, Netflix also released a 6-episode docuseries called “Harry & Meghan,” where they shared their side of the story about their royal exit in 2020. The pair blamed the British media for the bulk of their problems during their stint in the palace. “The issue is when someone who’s marrying in, who should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than the person who was born to do this —that upsets people,” Harry boldly claimed during an episode of the series.
