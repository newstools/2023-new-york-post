Win and you’re in. That was the mindset for the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers entering the NFC Championship game Sunday afternoon, and the Eagles emerged with a 31-7 victory that clinched a berth in Super Bowl 2023 on Feb. 12. The 49ers, led by upstart third-string quarterback Brock Purdy and dual-threat running back Christian McCaffrey, bring the NFL’s fifth-ranked offense and No. 2 defense to Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field, but an injury to Purdy forced fourth-string quarterback Josh Johnson to play. That allowed Philadelphia’s early lead to continue growing behind four rushing touchdowns, even as Purdy eventually returned. The Eagles punched their ticket to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., where they’ll face the winner of the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals.
