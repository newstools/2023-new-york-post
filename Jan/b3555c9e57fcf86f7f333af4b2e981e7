The Justice Department is considering additional searches for classified documents at other locations connected to President Biden — as the commander-in-chief escaped to his beach house over the weekend, according to a report. On Friday, federal agents found more classified materials stashed away at the 80-year-old president’s Wilmington, Del., home — including some dating back to his time as a senator. Now, DOJ officials are considering extending the search for the sensitive documents to other places, CBS reported Saturday, citing a source familiar with the investigation. One of those sites would likely be the president’s home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., roughly 90 miles from the Wilmington residence. Biden’s personal attorney conducted an earlier search of the Rehoboth Beach property but found no classified documents. The president spent the weekend in Rehoboth as the FBI carried out the search of his Wilmington home. Biden’s attorneys found classified documents at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, in November and more sensitive records were found in December and earlier this month at the Wilmington home. Attorney General Merrick Garland named a special counsel, Robert Hur, to investigate Biden’s handling of the classified documents. In November, Garland named veteran prosecutor Jack Smith to investigate former President Donald Trump after boxes of classified documents were uncovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in an FBI raid in August.
