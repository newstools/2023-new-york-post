Incredible security footage has captured the moment a shrieking pet parrot was able to scare off would-be thieves as they attempted to break into a Melbourne, Australia home on New Year’s Eve. The two-year-old macaw, named Versace, had been left alone inside the house in the city’s north as its owners enjoyed a night out for the first time in years. But the bright blue parrot knew something was wrong when strangers attempted to break in and began shrieking. The parrot let out ear-piercing screams, with each shriek becoming increasingly louder as the pet became more troubled by the attempted break in. The series of short but head-splitting shrieks by the parrot derailed the thieves plans and caused them to flee. The timestamp of the footage signaled the attempted break in was just before midnight and was filmed by a security camera in their living room. “Best guard dog we‘ve ever bought,” Versace’s owner Alexandra Kavanagh told 9 News. “Better than a guard dog.” The break in left the parrot in a distressed state, as she initially refused to leave her cage. “Eventually she did and I just kissed her for ages,” Kavanagh said. “I haven‘t let her go since.” Since the incident the brave parrot has been indulging with her favorite snacks and treats. “She occasionally doesn‘t mind a bit of KFC,” Kavanagh said. “Chicken and chips as a little treat. I plan on buying her all new toys.”
