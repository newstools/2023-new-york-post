Gisele Bündchen seems to be taking advantage of the beach life post-divorce as she took a dip in the ocean with her children and friends in Costa Rica. The new divorcee, seen in exclusive photos from Jan. 11 that The Post obtained, sported a modest, all-black bikini as she chatted it up with a mystery couple while her daughter Vivian, 10, played in the water with another child. While drying off on the busy Costa Rican beach, the Brazilian supermodel, 42, donned a leopard-print skirt coverup. The runway vixen’s heartthrob trainer Joaquim Valente was nowhere to be seen during the outing, but just last week the two were spotted going for a one-on-one jog. The fit duo sparked romance rumors back in November 2022 when Page Six obtained exclusive photos of the two dining together in Costa Rica with Bündchen’s two children — son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10, whom she shares with Brady — and Valente’s co-trainer, Jordan. Bündchen and Brady, 45, finalized their divorce back in October 2022 after the two reportedly “grew apart,” according to the supermodel. She went on to share that she and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback would be continuing to co-parent their children “to give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve. The runway legend has since made a full return to her career following her divorce from Brady, with a recent campaign with Louis Vuitton.
