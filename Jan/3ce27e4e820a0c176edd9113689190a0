A new police chief selected to replace Southampton’s “million dollar cop” should not have gotten the job, according to the village’s mayor. The village board named Anthony Carter, a former NYPD inspector, as the top cop, offering him the job — and a fat compensation package — despite Carter not having taken the chief’s exam, said Mayor Jesse Warren. “We had stated to the public that we had wanted a candidate who had taken and passed the exam,” Warren said. Carter is set to be paid $225,000 a year. In addition, he will get 26 vacation days, 18 sick days, 13 holidays and four personal days a year under a five-year contract, according to Warren. The village will also give him $1,000 to buy study materials for the chief’s test, according to  copy of his offer letter which was seen by The Post. Carter, 49,  is a a deputy police commissioner for Suffolk County. He will start as an acting chief in March and only be named permanent chief if he passes the test. Carter will replace Thomas Cummings, who left in September 2021 and whose contract had come under fire from Warren. Cummings left with a separation agreement that paid him $774,000 in unused sick, vacation and personal time as well as health benefits for life. His 2021 base salary was $274,000.
