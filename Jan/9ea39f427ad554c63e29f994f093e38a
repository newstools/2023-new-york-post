Pink Floyd has seen the “Dark Side” of their fans. Pink Floyd fans made noise Thursday after the 60s band said that it would release a 50th-anniversary edition of their album “Dark Side of the Moon” which was initially released in 1973, reports Newsweek. The announcement was made by the band on their social media accounts and featured an updated photo of the band’s iconic prism and rainbow. Most fans greeted the news with enthusiasm while others slammed the band with claims of “wokeness.” “Why does there have to be a bloody woke rainbow,” slammed one Twitter user. “Lose the wokeness,” wrote Donna Bradshaw in a now-deleted tweet. “Longtime fan. Do you now have handlers? Kanye has exposed this part of the industry. Been listening to your music since 70s. Let’s see your response.” One Twitter user compiled a full list of the complaints on all the social media sites calling for responses. “Pink Floyd updated their profile picture to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Dark Side of the Moon, and the replies are… something,” tweeted Travis Akers. “Lose the rainbow,” one Facebook user stated. “You’re making yourself look stupid.” Other commenters found the hateful comments hilarious. “You can easily spot the Pink Floyd fans who ate too many lead paint chips in their youth,” joke one user. “Dear anti-wokes who clearly don’t understand Pink Floyd, maybe looking at the album cover for Dark Side of the Moon will add some much-needed clarity,” said another. “Me watching everyone freak out about Pink Floyd’s continued use of a rainbow on the cover of ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ despite it being a longstanding tradition for the past 50 years,” chimed in another.
