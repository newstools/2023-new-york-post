Iga Swiatek’s Australian Open campaign had a slight hiccup off the court. The world No. 1 was seen reprimanding a fan who appeared to throw a tennis ball at her while she signed autographs following her first-round win over Germany’s Jule Niemeier on Monday. In a video from the tournament in Melbourne, Swiatek, 21, can be seen ducking as a tennis ball hit her midsection. When she stood up holding the ball, the Polish pro waved her index finger in the direction of the crowd and appeared to tell the fan not to throw it at her. Regardless of the situation, Swiatek signed the ball and continued greeting fans and signing autographs at Rod Laver Arena. Swiatek — who was a semifinalist at last year’s Australian Open — improved to 15-1 in openers at Grand Slam tournaments with her first-round victory over Niemeier. The 22-year-old Niemeier is ranked 69th and was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist last year. In September, Swiatek made headlines for her post-match interview following a comeback win against Aryna Sabalenka in the second semifinal at the U.S. Open. Swiatek, who used the restroom after the first set, said she felt much “lighter” when she returned to the court, and credited the bathroom break for enhancing her performance. “It’s more what I did (in the bathroom),” Swiatek said at the time. “I kind of needed to go. For sure I felt lighter. Sorry, that’s disgusting.” Swiatek would go on to win the tournament — her third Grand Slam triumph — to continue her run to the top of the spot. Swiatek will face Colombia’s Camila Osorio, ranked 84th, in the second round at the Australian Open on Wednesday. — with AP
