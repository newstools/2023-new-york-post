You gotta walk the walk — but make sure you walk this way. In 2022, it was all about hot girl walks, but for 2023, fitness influencers are swearing by the incline treadmill workout. Fitness influencer Layla, who regularly posts fitness tips on TikTok as @liftwithlayla, insists the way to shake up and improve your gym routine is to walk on the treadmill at an incline for 30 minutes a day. “Me trying to explain to people that walking on a treadmill around 15 incline/ 3 mph keeps muscle growth and burns fat faster than jogging or running,” she wrote over a clip of her mid-workout on the treadmill, which has been viewed over 5.3 million times. “Do it for 5x a week for 30 minutes,” she continued. “And by the end of January, you would have lost weight and kept it off.” Layla also added that it’s an “effective form of cardio,” noting that other forms are often too hard on your knees and ankles. In general, the incline workout is considered a good cardio workout and when done in collaboration with healthy eating and strength exercises, has been proven to help tone and burn fat, according to Healthline. The method is popular amongst TikTokers, with the hashtag #15330workout amassing over 8.9 million views. Thousands of users commented on her video, swearing by its fat-burning and sculpting powers. “I do cardio two days a week at an Incline of 10, speed of 3.4 for 15 minutes. This combined with strength training I’ve lost 65lbs since 7/12/22!” a user gushed. “At 14/3/30 4-5x per week, I’m down 44 pounds in 6 months. I swear by it,” agreed another. “I was doing a 10 incline at 3.5 but it was killing my joints,” shared another. “I do a 5.5 at 3.0-3.2 right now and I’m in the best shape I’ve been in in a while.” But for those who feel it’s too much of a mountain to climb as a gym newbie, Layla also posted a workout suggestion for those “new to the gym.” “Start off on include 8, speed 2.7. Do this for five minutes,” she wrote. “We’re warming up.”
