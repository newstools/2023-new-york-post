To kick off the New Year, the New York Post is launching its first-ever Scholars Contest in conjunction with Command Education, the nation’s leader in education and college consulting. High schoolers from around the New York area are welcome to showcase their writing skills and journalistic instincts for this contest. Those who enter will have the chance to have their article published in the New York Post and on nypost.com. All writers of published submissions will be invited to the New York Post for a special Scholars Masterclass. The top three honorees will also receive an immersive New York Post Discovery Day tailored to their interests, a college prep training session with our partner, Command Education, and a grant for their school! “We want to inspire a new generation of journalists,” said Keith Poole, editor-in-chief of the New York Post, in his announcement of the contest. The New York Post will also be awarding grants to the top three schools who make the most submissions! Ready to enter, or know a high schooler who is up for the challenge?
