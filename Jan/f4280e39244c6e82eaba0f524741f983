A bouncer died after being punched into a coma by an enraged man outside a Chelsea bar on Christmas Eve, police said Monday. Duane Patterson, 61, was working at Billymark’s West Bar on Ninth Avenue near West 29th Street when he and a man inside began brawling around 3 a.m. Dec. 24, cops said. The fight spilled outside, where the suspect slugged Patterson in the face, knocking him to the ground, where he hit his head. A bartender found him unconscious and called 911. Patterson, of Fort George, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he was initially listed in critical condition with a skull fracture. He spent several days in a coma, and police confirmed on Monday that he had succumbed to his injuries. “Duane suffered a traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for four days,” his daughter, Arianna Buchholz, said in a GoFundMe post. “The intensive care he received was unfortunately not enough to revive his mind,” she wrote. “The family is in need of emotional and financial support during this devastating time.” Buchholz described her dad — who was an organ donor — as “such a strong, honorable person” who “was always quick to make us laugh.” Cops are still looking to track down the suspect, who fled on foot. He is described as a male with a dark complexion, between 40 and 50 years old, bald with a heavy build. He was last seen wearing a red Champion hoodie sweater, black jacket, black pants and black sneakers. Police did not know the circumstances leading to the deadly dispute.
