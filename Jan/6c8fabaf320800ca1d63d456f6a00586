Anne Hathaway revealed Saturday during a question and answer panel that she was once asked if she was a “good girl” or a “bad girl” by a journalist when she was just 16 years old, according to Variety. Speaking at the screening of “Eileen” at the Sundance Film Festival, the 40-year-old actress made the startling revelation about how she resonated with the film. “I just remembered one of the very first questions I ever got asked when I started acting and had to do press was: ‘Are you a good girl or a bad girl?’” said the “Devil Wears Prada” actress. “I was 16. And my 16-year-old self wanted to respond with this film.” According to Hathaway, she signed up for the thriller after seeing the director William Oldroyd’s 2016 drama, “Lady MacBeth” starring Florence Pugh. “I thought it was an extraordinary work,” said Hathaway. “I saw a study of female complication that hit me really, really deep, and I felt like Will was a filmmaker that could be trusted to tell complicated stories, especially about females.” “Eileen” was originally adapted for the screen by Ottessa Moshfeg from a book of the same name and tells the story of a doctor (Hathaway) who forms a homoerotic bond with a Massachusetts prison staffer (Thomasin McKenzie) who is forced to take care of her alcoholic father. “I love…dark, strangely funny, weird stories,” said director William Oldroyd.
