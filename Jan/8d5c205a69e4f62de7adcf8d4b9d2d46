Love bites. A Turkish model and influencer reportedly required emergency surgery after an overzealous date bit through her tongue during their passionate first kiss. A video of the star getting her tongue sewn together is currently blowing up online. “Oh gosh, it hurts a lot. Is this a joke?” Ceyda Ersoy, 34, said while describing the saliva-swapping fiasco, which occurred while the bombshell was reportedly French kissing her date for the first time, reported Jam Press. “Seems like I couldn’t get to know him well,” explained the Turkish celeb, who boasts over 620,000 followers on Instagram. “It’s been a month since we first met, this was our first kiss.” Their inaugural makeout sesh went south after, in the heat of the moment, the unnamed Mr. Bite reportedly chomped down on her licker so hard, he split it in two, per the clip. Needless to say, Ersoy was left speechless (almost literally) over the incident. “Is it only me whose tongue has been ripped off during a kiss?” exclaimed the social media star, who was subsequently rushed to a hospital in Istanbul. Accompanying footage shows surgeons stitching up the patient’s nearly severed licker following the accident. Thankfully, Ersoy said the operation went off without a hitch: “Guys, I’m OK now, thanks a lot for your well-wishes. They’ve stitched it up.” The self-described “Miss Fotomodel of Turkey 2010” is still unsure how her date managed to mutilate her so badly during their simple make-out sesh. “I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t really know how to kiss,” she wondered, before quipping, “My advice to you is don’t even say hi to guys who are Scorpios.” Social media had a field day with her mouth-mangling makeout mishap. “Did you kiss Alien or Predator or a Komodo dragon?” teased one, while another jokingly chalked it up to a “work accident.” In a far more ludicrous amorous accident in 2021, a frisky UK fellow accidentally snapped his penis lengthwise during a disastrous rendezvous in the sack.
