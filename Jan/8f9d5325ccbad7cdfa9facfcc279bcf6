Charles Barkley is taking potshots at Skip Bayless again. Barkley has had a years-long beef with the Fox Sports provocateur and decided to poke the man whose partnership with Shannon Sharpe appears to be deteriorating on Thursday. “I’m sick of you man. I’m sick of you,” Barkley jokingly said to Shaquille O’Neal on TNT’s “Inside the NBA,” with a chuckle. “You interrupted Ernie already. Your first show of the year. You already interrupted him. Can he finish his monologue?” Later in the program, they showed a tweet about Barkley clowning around, and Barkley took the opportunity to jokingly impersonate Bayless. “I’m not taking my tweet tweet down! I’m not taking my tweet down! I believe what I said!” Barkley laughed. Barkley was not done. He later directed one more shot at Shaq: “I’m just like Shannon — I know what it’s like to work with someone you hate.” Barkley was of course referring to the dustup that Bayless and Sharpe had on Wednesday.  On Monday night, when Bills safety Damar Hamlin was suffering from cardiac arrest on the field, Bayless tweeted, “No doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of this game – but how? This late in the season, a game of this magnitude is crucial to the regular-season outcome … which suddenly seems so irrelevant.” While Bayless had several other tweets expressing the utmost empathy for Hamlin, Sharpe was so unhappy with the one in question that he did not go to work to do their TV show on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday had a feisty segment with Bayless, who interrupted Sharpe’s monologue to say that he would not take the tweet down. Barkley has been public about his dislike for Bayless for years, once sharing a morbid fantasy of killing the broadcaster.
