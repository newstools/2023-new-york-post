The decapitated body of a young wife married for less than four months was found by Texas law enforcement, who have charged her husband in the “gruesome” murder, the Waller County sheriff confirmed to The Post. The 21-year-old Hispanic woman’s body was discovered in the home, but her head was not, Sheriff Troy Guidry said. “It was a portion of a body, dismembered, and a residence that was covered in blood — a gruesome scene, at best,” he told reporters Thursday. The husband, Jared Dicus, 21, was interviewed by cops and confessed to the killing, Guidry revealed. The wife has not yet been identified by authorities, but a social media post by a county judge who married the duo on Oct. 21 identified her as Anggy Diaz and thanked the couple for allowing him to be part of their ceremony. A knife, believed to be the murder weapon, was found at the property with Diaz’s severed head. Dicus’ family members called deputies to the couple’s home — a small cottage located behind a main house where the husband’s parents live in a rural area northwest of Houston — Wednesday afternoon. Diaz was believed to be dead since around 11 p.m. the night before her remains were discovered. “There have been prior calls, disturbance-wise, but nothing to this effect, to this level of violence,” Guidry shared. The young wife is a Nicaraguan citizen who was described as “undocumented” by the sheriff. Her social media posts show her involved in fitness and features multiple photos of her and Dicus.
