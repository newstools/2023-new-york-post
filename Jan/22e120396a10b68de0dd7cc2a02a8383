Award season has officially begun. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday who will be presenting the prestigious awards at the 80th Golden Globes. Jamie Lee Curtis, Billy Porter, Ana de Armas, Nicole Byer, Quentin Tarantino and Tracy Morgan are slated to appear as presenters at the awards. Additionally,  Colman Domingo, Natasha Lyonne, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Niecy Nash-Betts and Ana Gasteyer will also doll out the trophies. Hosted by Jerrod Carmichael, the awards show will be presented on NBC and the Peacock app live from the Beverly Hilton on Jan. 10, 2023. Nominees for the awards include Austin Butler for his role as Elvis Presley, Michelle Williams, Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner for “The Fablemans.” Daniel Craig was also nominated for his role as Detective Benoit Blanc in Rian Johnson’s “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.” Brendan Fraser — who was nominated for his role in Darren Aronofsky’s “The Whale”  — said that he plans to not attend the ceremony after he was allegedly sexually assaulted by the former HFPA president Philip Berk in 2003. “I have more history with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association than I have respect for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” Fraser said in an interview with GQ in November. “It’s because of the history that I have with them.” “And my mother didn’t raise a hypocrite. You can call me a lot of things, but not that,” added the 54-year-old. The Golden Globes were canceled by NBC in 2022 after several viewers slammed the award show for not having any Black voters in the organization. NBC chalked up the cancelation as the show needing “meaningful reform,” which the HFPA eventually pledged to.
