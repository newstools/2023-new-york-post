Prince Harry’s much-anticipated new memoir, “Spare” is finally here, and with it, all of the drama you would expect from a tell-all penned by the media-savviest royal out there. If you’re anything like us, you haven’t been able to pry yourself away from the stories slowly trickling out over the past few weeks from advanced readers. First, we learned why the book is titled “Spare,” a reference to an alleged comment by King Charles, that Diana had given him an “heir” (William) and a “spare” (Harry). We’ve read leaked excerpts of Harry losing his virginity, his “frostbitten penis” at his brother’s wedding, his admission of cocaine use as a teenager, his kill-count in Afghanistan, and his ongoing (and sometimes physical) feud with his older brother, William. The press tour has made a lot of people angry (namely, just about everyone else in the royal family, save for Meghan Markle), and, perhaps not coincidentally, sent pre-orders through the roof. Today, “Spare” is officially released on bookshelves, and electronic bookshelves, everywhere. If you just can’t wait for your Amazon copy to arrive, or would prefer to hear it straight from the man himself, you can also snag the Harry-narrated audiobook of “Spare” on Audible now, available for just $5.95 a month for the first four months, for a limited time only. If you’d prefer a physical copy, the hardcover edition of “Spare” is available now for just $22 on Amazon, a full $14 off list price. If you want (or need) to get your hands on “Spare” immediately, the Kindle version is also available for just $18. All this royal drama all at once is rare.
