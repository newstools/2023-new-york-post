It was a “Nightmare”-ish experience. Rooney Mara has revealed that she almost quit acting after an experience she had on the reboot of “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” according to the podcast “LaunchLeft.” “A few years before [‘The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo’], I had done a ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ remake, which was not a good experience,” Mara said of the 2010 flick. “I have to be careful with what I say and how I talk about it. It wasn’t the best experience making it and I got to this place, that I still live in, that I don’t want to act unless I’m doing stuff that I feel like I have to do,” she added. “So after making that film, I decided, ‘OK, I’m just not going to act anymore unless it’s something that I feel that way about.'” The Oscar-nominated “Carol” actress previously told Entertainment Weekly that when she auditioned for the film, it wasn’t something she initially wanted. “If this is what my opportunities are going to be like, then I’m not that interested in acting. So I was very discouraged and disheartened,” the 37-year-old said in 2011. According to Mara, it wasn’t until David Fincher’s adaptation of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” that she began to see things from a new perspective. “David really took me under his wing. He became my mentor in a lot of ways,” the actress told the podcast. “He took such great care to make sure that I knew that I had a voice and that my opinion meant something,” Mara said. “He constantly was empowering me, which I think really affected the rest of my choices thereafter.”
