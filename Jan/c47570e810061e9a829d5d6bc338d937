Sean McVay is not going anywhere. The Rams head coach informed players that he will remain on the job, the Rams announced on Friday. This ordinarily would not be an enormous surprise given that McVay led the Rams to a Super Bowl title last season. However, ESPN’s Adam Schefter recently reported that McVay was considering stepping away from the job this offseason. The Rams had a disappointing season, going 5-12 as the defending champs. It was a year in which reigning Offensive Player of the Year Cooper Kupp suffered a season-ending ankle injury in November and quarterback Matt Stafford was also banged up, missing eight games. “McVay has gone back and forth on the decision and needs time to get away to process all that has transpired over the past year: winning a Super Bowl, being courted to work in television, getting married, watching his wife’s home country of Ukraine invaded, losing his grandfather and then coaching a team that has fallen short of its expectations,” Schefter reported last weekend. The Rams do not have a first-round pick, with their No. 6 overall pick going to the Lions as part of the trade that brought Stafford to Los Angeles. The 36-year-old McVay dabbled last offseason with the possibility of leaving coaching to join the media. However, he ultimately reached an agreement with the Rams on a contract extension. “I feel good,” McVay said at the time. “It was always kind of really good dialogue that existed. These things, they take time, but I think it’s important.” McVay has been the Rams’ coach since 2017 and the team has a 68-30 record with him in charge. With McVay staying in place, there are currently five open head coaching jobs: Cardinals, Broncos, Colts, Texans and Panthers. There has been speculation that the Cowboys and Chargers jobs could open up if Mike McCarthy and/or Brandon Staley fail to advance their teams to the second round of the playoffs.
