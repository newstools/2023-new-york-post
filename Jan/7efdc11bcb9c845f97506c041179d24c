The Mets are keeping another one of their key players for the foreseeable future. The Post’s Jon Heyman and Joel Sherman confirm that the team has agreed with 2022 NL batting champ Jeff McNeil on a four-year contract extension worth $50 million. The deal includes a club option at $13.75 million for the fifth year. The news was first reported by ESPN’s Jeff Passan. McNeil led the National League with a .326 batting average in 2022. It has been a busy offseason for Mets GM Billy Eppler and owner Steve Cohen. While they had a blockbuster deal with shortstop Carlos Correa fall through due to long-term concerns about how his ankle would hold up and lost Jacob deGrom in free agency, the team has signed pitchers Justin Verlander, Jose Quintana, Kodai Senga, David Robertson and Adam Ottavino, as well as catcher Omar Narvaez in free agency. They’ve also reached big money extensions with outfielder Brandon Nimmo and closer Edwin Diaz.
