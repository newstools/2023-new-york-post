An irate man attacked his ex-wife’s boyfriend with a hatchet and fatally shot him in a jealous rage in a Brooklyn parking lot, police said Friday. The 47-year-old ex-hubby, Dmytro Lapok, allegedly flew off the handle when he saw the woman with her 42-year-old boyfriend in a parking lot on Ocean Avenue near Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay just after 9 p.m. Thursday, cops said. Locals told The Post they heard screaming coming from the parking lot at first before one women’s voice cried out to call 911. “I heard people screaming. I walked over to the window and saw two people arguing, a man and a woman,” said a resident, who declined to provide a name. “She was holding him back so that he doesn’t go past her. He was holding a hatchet in his hand, so it looked like she was holding him back from doing something with the hatchet.” Another nearby resident said, “a woman screamed, ‘Call 911.’ Then the ambulance and the police showed up.” Cops found the 42-year-old lying on the pavement with the 44-year-old girlfriend crying at his side, while screaming and pointing at her ex, police sources said. The victim had been hit in the head with the hatchet and shot in the chest, cops said. About six shots were believed to have been fired, sources said. He was rushed to Coney Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The ex-husband, whose name was not released, remained in the parking lot — where congealed pools of blood and scattered teeth were spotted Friday — and confessed to the attack, sources said. Police found the gun under the SUV and the bloody hatchet in the trunk, sources said. Lapok was charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.
