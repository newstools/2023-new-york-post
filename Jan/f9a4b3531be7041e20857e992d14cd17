LeBron James torched the Rockets for 48 points on Monday night — and he still felt “old as crap” after the game. Despite being 38 years old, James is averaging almost 30 points per game this season. However, his 20th season in the league continues to put things into perspective. During a timeout on Monday night, Houston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. gave James a not-so-so-subtle reminder of his his age. Smith, the 19-year-old rookie, mentioned with glee that James played his father – Jabari Smith Sr. – in his NBA debut for the Cavaliers on Oct. 30, 2003 against the Sacramento Kings. In the viral moment, Smith said to James, “You played against my dad in your first NBA game ever.” To which James, with a laugh, responded, “Why did you do that to me?” Smith countered with, “You feel old, don’t you?” Following the game, a 140-132 victory for the Lakers, James spoke with NBATV’s Jared Greenberg about the comment. “It made me feel old as crap,” he said. “I’ve had the pleasure and the opportunity to play against a couple of dad and father combinations – Gary Trent, Gary Trent Jr., Kenyon Martin [Jr.], Kenyon Martin Sr., and now Jabari Smith Jr. and Jabari Smith Sr.” “It’s been a great ride in these 20 years that I’ve been able to see a lot of great players come in and out. t’s always an honor for me.” James’ 48 points moved him within 316 of the NBA scoring record currently held by Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who totaled 38,387 in his career. In the past seven games, James has scored more than 35 points five times. James is on pace to break the record in the next few weeks. Smith Sr. played for the Kings, 76ers and Nets in a brief NBA career that ended in 2005. Smith Jr. was the No. 2 pick of the NBA Draft after starring at Auburn last season. Smith Jr. is averaging 12 points and seven rebounds per game, halfway through his rookie season.
