The Washington Capitals are in the middle of a surge in the Metropolitan Division. They are 13-2-2 with a plus-34 goal differential in their last 17 games and have vaulted themselves to within five points of the Carolina Hurricanes for first place. Not too shabby for a team that was written off around Thanksgiving. Even more encouraging for Washington is that Nicklas Backstrom and Tom Wilson made their season debuts on Sunday in a 1-0 win over Columbus. Everything seems to be pointing up for the Caps. But when it comes to betting, that means it’s probably time to consider selling. As solid as Washington has been over the last six weeks, the Capitals were fortunate to win against the Blue Jackets and didn’t look at the races in a loss to Nashville over the weekend, either. Those performances may just be minor blips, but there is some negative regression coming for the Caps, who are outpacing their expected goals data by a wide margin over their last 10 contests. Philadelphia, meanwhile, comes into this contest off an impressive 4-0 win over the red-hot Buffalo Sabres to give them four wins in their last five contests. This recent hot stretch doesn’t change the fact that coach John Tortorella’s Flyers are one of the worst teams in the NHL, but they’re in good form and are a dangerous underdog against an overvalued Capitals team on Wednesday night.
