A 23-year-old woman was killed in a dramatic one-car crash on Staten Island that left the vehicle split in two lengthwise, police said. The driver was arrested following the deadly episode, cops said. One Island business owner reporting to work likened the bloody, debris-strewned crash site to “Beirut.” The unidentified victim died from injuries she suffered after being thrown from the passenger seat of the white Dodge sedan she was riding in, police said. The episode unfolded around 4:45 a.m. Saturday, authorities said. A 30-year-old man was driving southbound when he lost control of the vehicle in front of 2545 Hylan Blvd., near New Dorp Lane, in the New Dorp section and struck a “barrier wall,” the NYPD said. “It seem the vehicle then hit a utility pole,” an NYPD spokesman said. While the driver suffered minor injuries, the 23-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. “The operator was taken into custody and charges are pending,”  an NYPD spokesman said. Mario Basso, 31, the owner of the H2O Auto Spa on Hylan Boulevard, said he and his crew arrived for work around 6:30 a.m. Saturday to encounter cops probing the wreckage about 100 feet from his business. “I don’t understand how the utility [pole] is still standing, it was hit so hard,” a shaken Basso said, adding, “The car was cut in half.” Said the stunned owner, who offered condolences to the victim’s family: “It’s a tragedy and it was a terrible morning for everybody involved. Everyone is very upset. It looks like Beirut. There’s debris and blood all over the place.”
