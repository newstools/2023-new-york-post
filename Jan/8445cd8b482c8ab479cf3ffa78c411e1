Mimi and her mini-me Monroe are hitting notes and Aspen slopes. Mariah Carey shared an Instagram post on Wednesday with her 11-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe on a ski trip. The singing mother and daughter duo were matching in metallic pink puffer jackets, black ski pants and beanies. She captioned the photos, “Matching ensems on the slopes!.” Her son Moroccan posed for the camera, too, opting for red instead of a matching pink shade. The 52-year-old mother shares the twins with Nick Cannon, who recently revealed that he struggles to spend time with his kids due to his busy work schedule. “Being a father of multiple kids, it’s always the biggest guilt on me is that I don’t get to spend enough time with all my children,” Cannon, 42, said on “The Checkup with Dr. David Agus.” “One ’cause I’m constantly working and two because I’m just spread thin,” the father-of-12 continued. Moroccan and Monroe can often be found shopping, vacationing or dancing behind the icon during her performances, such as the 2022 Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade. The Queen of Christmas and her twins also enjoy participating in winter activities, whether it’s ice skating or getting a surprise midnight sleigh ride from Santa Claus. The singer introduced her daughter into the music world in 2022 during CBS special “Mariah Carey: Merry Christmas To All!” Monroe showed off her vocal range, singing “Away in a Manger” letting the world know she’s up next for her mother’s throne.
