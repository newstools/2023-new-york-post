A 14-year-old boy was slashed with a box cutter during a fight with a man who bumped into him at a Brooklyn train station this week, cops said. The teen was getting off a southbound L train at Jefferson Street and Wyckoff Avenue in Bushwick around 3 p.m. Tuesday when another man bumped into him on his way out, authorities said. The bump sparked a clash that turned physical â€” with the man slashing the teen on the left arm with an orange-handled box cutter, police said. The suspect took off, cops said. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was treated for the slash wound and released. Cops released surveillance video and photos of the suspect late Thursday. He is described as around 25 years old with a light complexion, about 5 feet 7 and 165 pounds, with a medium build and short, dark hair. He was last seen wearing a dark hooded jacket, a dark knit cap, light-colored pants and brown boots.
