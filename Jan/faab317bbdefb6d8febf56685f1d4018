The singer of the Grammy-winning band Cage The Elephant was busted in a Lower Manhattan hotel with two loaded firearms, cops said Friday. Matthew Schultz, 39, was charged with criminal possession of a firearm after cops found the guns in his room at the Bowery Hotel, according to police. Cops said the rocker — whose band is known for the 2015 album “Tell Me I’m Pretty” — spent the night in the 9th Precinct. It was not clear how police became aware of the weapons. A rep for the band did not immediately respond. A hotel employee told The Post Schultz was “somewhat of a regular” at the hotel.
