Locals in Bursa, Turkey, were awed Thursday morning by a huge, distinctively shaped cloud that was seen glowing like a pie in the sky. Hundreds took to social media to share footage of the unusual pink formation, with their videos quickly going viral across the world. Many tawdry Twitter users responded to clips of the cloud, saying the natural phenomena bore a startling resemblance to female genitalia. “A giant vagina!” one pervy pundit proclaimed. “Oh man, I hate my dirty mind. I should quit watching porn,” a second sleazy social media user quipped. The online excitement even caught the attention of “The Crown” actress Gillian Anderson, who also implied that the cloud looked like a human vagina. “Now if this isn’t a sign I don’t know what is (That God is a woman),” the “First Lady” star, 54, stated in a tweet shared with her 965,000 followers. Others responded to the actress saying the cloud looked more like a UFO. Several subsequently cracked jokes about Anderson’s most famous role in the sci-fi series “The X-Files,” in which she played an FBI agent investigating extraterrestrial activity. “Sure does feel like [a] missing episode of ‘The X-Files,” one fan humorously wrote. A second chimed in:: “[It’s] a UFO calling for another season!” However, Turkey’s State Meteorological Service told local media there wasn’t a need to call in alien investigators, saying that it was simply a rare “lenticular cloud.” According to the organization, lenticular clouds are generally formed as a result of strong wind fluctuations over hills and mountains when the air is stable and moist. They most often form in winter, but it is possible to see them at other times of the year. Eyewitnesses said the shape remained intact for about an hour before disappearing from the sky.
