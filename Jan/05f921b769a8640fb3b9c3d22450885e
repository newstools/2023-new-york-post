What’s Quay Walker’s vendetta with opposing teams’ staff members? The Packers linebacker was ejected after shoving a Lions athletic trainer during Green Bay’s 20-16 loss Sunday night as they crashed out of playoff contention. It’s the second time this season Walker, whom the Packers selected with the No. 22 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, was kicked out of a game after going at an opposing staff member. He was ejected following the team’s loss to the Bills on Oct. 30 for shoving one of Buffalo’s assistant coaches. Walker is the only player in the NFL this season to be ejected twice. “I’ve got a much higher standard for our players than to do silly things like that,” Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said after the game. “I mean, we’ve had a guy get ejected twice. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that in my career. And we’ve got to be much more mentally tough.” Trailing 16-13 midway through the fourth quarter, Lions running back Jamaal Williams caught a short pass for two yards, but stayed down on the ground in pain. As the team’s medical staff came onto the field, one trainer attempted to squeeze past Walker in order to reach Williams. As he attempted to do so, however, Walker shoved him with two hands from behind, sending the trainer stumbling a few feet backwards. “That’s ridiculous,” Mike Tirico said on NBC’s broadcast. Walker was subsequently flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and disqualified from the game. Two plays later, Williams’ 1-yard rushing touchdown gave the Lions their decisive 20-16 lead. An emotional Walker was seen on on the broadcast screaming as he walked back into the locker room.
