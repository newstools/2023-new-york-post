It was an affair to remember. Stormy Daniels helps gay men find love on the new TV show “For the Love of DILFs,” premiering Tuesday on the OUTtv Apple TV channel and the OUTtv Roku channel, reports People. The eight-episode series follows Daniels, 43, as she shepherds “Daddies” and “Himbos” in their hunt for a paramour and the $10,000 prize. “I host the show, but I also lived in the mansion with the singles to help guide them through this experience, so I can tell you firsthand that these are real love stories,” Daniels said in a statement. “I’m not a crier, but they even made me shed a few tears on set because I got so invested. Every day was an adventure with the ‘Daddies’ and ‘Himbos.’ “ A “daddy” typically describes an older man who is involved with a younger man. On the show, daddies are “confident, mature and ready to show you the ropes.” “Himbo” is defined as an attractive man with little intelligence. On the show, himbos are “sexy, fun and ready to show you a good time.” Just like in “The Bachelor” franchise, daddies and himbos — along with Daniels, who serves as a relationship adviser — live in a mansion and interact with each other. “An epic romance is about to unfold as two groups of singles hunt for love,” the trailer reveals. “At the end of this emotional journey, only one couple will be voted most likely to succeed.” Daniels promises steamy scenes, dramatic moments and feuds. “As a queer woman myself, it was amazing to get to work on a project created to uplift the LGBTQA+ community. It’s not just the stereotypical stuff you’re expecting,” said Daniels. “This show has so much heart, and I’m genuinely proud of what we made.” “Listen, I know sexy when I see it … and this show is hot,” adds Daniels. Outside the show, Daniels made headlines this week after Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg began presenting evidence to a grand jury Monday related to former President Trump’s role in hush-money payments to Daniels.
