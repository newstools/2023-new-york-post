Francisco Lindor and his wife Katia Reguero Lindor have a lot to celebrate. The 29-year-old Mets shortstop and the “Un-a-Parent” podcast host are expecting their second child in June, they announced in a joint Instagram post on Tuesday. “Celebrating love & baby número dos coming June 2023 ,” she wrote in her caption, adding the hashtag, “soon to be family of 4.” The couple was pictured standing on a balcony overlooking the ocean in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, as Katia posed in a slit dress with her hand on her belly. She also shared the photo to her Instagram story with a poll that was titled, “Team Boy or Girl.” Lindor and his wife are already parents to their daughter, Kalina Zoé, who turned two in November. Lindor and Katia celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary in December after tying the knot at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami. The four-time All-Star took to Instagram last month to share a wedding video that included a champagne reception at an outdoor rooftop pool with a live band and a firework display. The couple also enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where they shared a kiss on a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower last month. “A dream come true, being in Paris with you 🫶 te amo,” Katia wrote on Instagram at the time. Lindor and Katia, who got engaged in 2020, met through social media. “I messaged her on Instagram,” Lindor told The Post in April. “Her picture popped up and I was like, ‘This girl is beautiful!’ “We talked for three months and then I met her in Arizona ‘cause I was out there for spring training,” he recalled at the time. “We just hung out and I was like, ‘I think she’s the one.’ At first, I was a little bit like, ‘Ahh, I don’t want to really commit,’ but I knew that she was the one.” Lindor, who spent the first six years of his career in Cleveland, and Katia moved to Manhattan after the shortstop secured a 10-year, $341 million deal with the Mets in 2021.
