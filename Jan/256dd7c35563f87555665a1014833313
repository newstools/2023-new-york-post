Former New York Giants defensive end and “Good Morning America” personality Michael Strahan was honored Monday with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Strahan, 51, celebrated with fellow GMA co-host Robin Roberts and loved ones, including Kayla Quick, his long-term girlfriend since 2015. Quick, 33, runs her own business — Fizzness — a beauty-based wellness company co-founded by Jamie Giardino. The couple have managed to keep their relationship quite private over the eight years. One of Strahan’s most recent Instagram posts featuring Quick was taken at Christmas 2021 and pictures her and Strahan dressed in matching pajamas with three of his four children – Michael Jr., Isabella, and Sophia. The pair was photographed behind another well-liked star and friend of Strahan, Terry Crews. Crews, another man of all trades — actor, television host, and former NFL linebacker for various teams — introduced Strahan at the ceremony saying,  “We’re former athletes and you know, the thing is, I remember when you retired and we were sitting there talking about, ‘Should I try this Hollywood thing?'” “When I see everything you’ve done since then, it’s so truly inspiring to me, to every person out there as a Black man, as an athlete, as every American should strive to be the kind of person you are,” Crews continued. “And the one word I have for Michael Strahan is ‘integrity.'”
