Cats on a plane? A flight attendant saved the day in a most unexpected way after helping reunite a lost tabby cat with its owner during a cross-continental flight, as seen in a video of the hairy mile-high-jinks currently going viral online. The unusual misplaced luggage incident reportedly transpired on December 30 on a United Airlines flight from Dallas, Texas, to San Francisco, California, according to Storyful. In the uproarious clip filmed by David Hislop, a flight attendant can be seen picking up the wandering tabby, which had reportedly been strolling down the aisle in first class like a sneaky coach passenger trying to use their bathroom. She finally manages to snatch up the four-legged escapee, whereupon she carries it down the aisle, asking if anyone is “missing a cat.” However, the feline manages to wriggle free of the sky waitress’ grip and books it down the aisle once again. The cat-astrophe finally ends after the owner walks up to the front of the plane and claims their wayward feline. It’s yet unclear how the kitty got loose in the first place. According to United Airlines’ travel guidelines, pets “must travel in either a hard-sided or soft-sided carrier that fits under the seat in front of you.” “There can only be one pet per carrier, and they must be able to stand up and turn around while inside,” the airline noted. This isn’t the first time a pet has run amok on a plane. In 2021, a loose cat redefined “sky maul” after attacking a pilot on a Qatar-bound flight, forcing it to return to its departure point in Sudan.
