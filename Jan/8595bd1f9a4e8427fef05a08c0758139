Rapper 50 Cent would have been $1 million richer… if it wasn’t for his pal, Eminem. The “In Da Club” hitmaker revealed that the duo was offered an eye-watering total of $9 million to perform at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Appearing on Real 92.3’s Big Boy’s Neighborhood show, Jackson revealed the pair were approached after their successful performance at the 2022 Super Bowl. They were joined by Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, and Anderson .Paak for a night of nostalgia-fueled hits. 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, said the “Lose Yourself” rapper would have received the bulk of the cash at $8 million, and he would’ve pocketed $1 million, if they had agreed to Qatar’s generous offer. But after speaking with Eminem’s representatives, Jackson said, “They’re like, ‘He’s not gonna do it.’ If you would do a one-off show, maybe you would do the biggest live sporting event in the world.” After they passed up on the opportunity, Jung Kook of BTS, Black Eyed Peas, and J Balvin ultimately signed on the dotted line instead. While it’s unclear why “The Real Slim Shady” rapper refused the venture, a myriad of controversies had plagued Qatar’s hosting of the event. The middle east country has found itself at the center of protests over its discrimination against women and the LGBTQ+ community. It comes as Jackson and Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, revealed Friday that they are in the process of developing an “8-mile” television show. “We’re in motion,” the “Many Men” rapper said. “It’s gonna be big … You know I ain’t got no duds.” “8 Mile” tells the story of an up-and-coming rapper — played by Eminem — in Detroit as he attempts to jump-start his career. Since its release, the soundtrack has dominated the billboard charts.
