Instead of spending years chasing down 100% fake Russian collusion by Donald Trump, turns out the FBI should have been more worried about the red under its own bed. In this case, that means former top counter-intel agent Charles McGonigal, arrested Saturday over his alleged illegal work (after retiring from the bureau) for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. He’s also accused of shenanigans on behalf of an agent of Deripaska’s while still serving in the New York FBI office. Yes, the same agency that helped launder the fictitious Steele Dossier into a wiretapping case against Trump campaign staffers — and whip up  a national frenzy over Trump’s nonexistent connections to Russian intelligence — has now seen one of its own nabbed for exactly the same kind of murky dealings it spent years sounding fake alarms about. Indeed, McGonigal was one of the chief instigators of the now-infamous “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into Trump and his circle that found zilch: He sent the email that set off the whole shebang! Bonus irony: Both dossier author Christopher Steele and FusionGPS, the firm that hired him to do it, also did work for Deripaska. The only way this could get more incestuous is if these names popped up in that ex-intel-officials’ domestic disinformation campaign to paint Hunter Biden’s 100% real laptop as a Russian op. The FBI is the nation’s chief law enforcement agency, with a vast remit and huge powers. Its naked politicization is bad enough; that it should’ve been pointing the “Russia” finger at itself instead of Trump is beyond appalling. Those House Republican investigators sure face a target-rich environment.
