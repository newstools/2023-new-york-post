To borrow one of her song titles: “Truth Hurts.” Lizzo, 34, took to social media Sunday morning to share her thoughts on cancel culture. The outspoken “About Damn Time” singer argued that cancel culture has “become trendy” and diminishes more serious issues. “This may be a random time to say this but it’s on my heart … cancel culture is appropriation,” she tweeted. “There was real outrage from truly marginalized people and now it’s become trendy, misused and misdirected.” She continued, “I hope we can phase out of this & focus our outrage on the real problems.” Last summer, Lizzo came under fire for using an “ableist” term in her song “Grrrls.” Disability advocates on social media slammed the singer for the use of the word “sp-z” — a common American slang for the term “spastic” to mean “going crazy” or “freaking out,” but is highly offensive in UK and aimed to belittle people with cerebral palsy. People demanded she either change the lyric or be canceled. Lizzo ended up conceded to the backlash and changed the lyrics in the song. “It’s been brought to my attention that there is a harmful word in my song ‘GRRRLS,'” she wrote in a statement posted to Twitter at the time. “Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language. As a fat black woman in America, I’ve had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally).” “I’m proud to say there’s a new version of girls with a lyric change. This is the result of me listening and taking action. As an influential artist I’m dedicated to being part of the challenge change I’ve been waiting to see in the world,” she continued.
