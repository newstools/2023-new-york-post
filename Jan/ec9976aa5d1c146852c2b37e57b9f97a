Fonda did a little touchdown dance after meeting Brady. Jane Fonda recalled Saturday how she felt after meeting football legend Tom Brady for her new film “80 for Brady,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. “My knees actually got weak when he walked into my trailer,” Fonda recalled. “I’m in awe of that kind of skill. When somebody is the best in the world at what they do, you have to honor that and respect it. I was just awestruck.” While Brady — whose team will soon be playing in the NFL playoffs — was not in attendance for the film’s premiere, he allegedly came to Fonda’s dressing room to introduce himself when he was on set for the film. “He was kind and humble, which is hard to believe considering how brilliant he is at what he does, but it’s true. He was also sweet and polite,” recalled the 85-year-old screen legend. The film — which was inspired by a true story — follows four friends (played by Sally Field, Rita Moreno Lily Tomlin and Fonda) and their pilgrimage to 2017’s Super Bowl LI  in an effort to witness a Patriot’s victory. “80 for Brady” also stars Billy Porter, Guy Fieri and even Patriots tight-end Ron Gronkowski. Brady — who also serves as a producer on the upcoming flick — was similarly starstruck. “The opportunity to work alongside these four amazingly talented women has truly been a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” the quarterback told People. “Not only are they true professionals and experts at their craft, but they are even better people, and it was an honor to be on set with them.” “80 for Brady” is set to hike into theaters on February 3, 2023.
