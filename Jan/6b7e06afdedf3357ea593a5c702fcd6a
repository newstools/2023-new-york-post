A 14-year-old boy was arrested on Tuesday after he was caught with a loaded gun at his Queens high school, police said. Just after 12:30, school safety agents observed the student drop the gun while walking up a stairway at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, according to police and sources. The security officers grabbed the teen and recovered the loaded .22 caliber handgun, police and sources said. It’s unclear what the student intended to do with the loaded weapon, cops said. Nobody was injured. All students remained in the school building while police investigated and “there was no disruption to the regular school day,” Principal Megan Colby said in a letter to parents after the incident. “This afternoon a student was discovered carrying a weapon in his book bag. The student, along with the book bag, were taken into a secure office and the New York City Police Department was notified,” Colby said. “No students or staff were harmed during this incident.”
