An NYPD officer was shot and wounded in the Bronx early Tuesday, police sources said. The officer was blasted in the arm when a suspect opened fire at an NYPD public safety team at East 183rd Street and Prospect Avenue in the Belmont neighborhood around 3 a.m. His fellow officers returned fire, striking the shooter, the sources said. The extent of the suspect’s injuries was not immediately known. The wounded cop was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police are still looking for one other armed suspect, who wore a ski mask, police sources said.
