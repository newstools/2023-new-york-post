Get out your body glitter and high-fashion fanny packs — the Coachella 2023 lineup has been announced. The beloved annual music festival returns to the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, on the weekends of April 14 to 16 and April 21 to 23, with Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and Frank Ocean set to headline. Other notable acts include Calvin Harris, Gorillaz, Chemical Brothers, Rosalia, Charli XCX, Bjork and Blondie. Ocean, 35, was slated to headline Coachella in 2020 before the event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad Bunny’s upcoming appearance contradicts his previous claim that he’ll be stepping out of the spotlight in 2023 for some much-needed R&R. The 28-year-old Puerto Rican singer is the first Latino artist to headline Coachella. Meanwhile, K-pop crooners Blackpink will also make history as the first South Korean girl group to headline the famous festival. Debbie Harry, 77, will return to the festival alongside her Blondie bandmates for the first time in nine years. Those considering Coachella will have a better chance at scoring passes — which start at $499 — for the second weekend of the festival as organizers say there are “very limited” weekend 1 passes still available. Fans can register now for access to a presale which will happen Jan. 13 at 8 a.m. — but just like the Taylor Swift Ticketmaster debacle, registering does not guarantee any pass type, packages or camping access. Following the announcement, thousands took to Twitter to express their excitement about the lineup and their desire to attend the festival. “Ready to buy my Coachella ticket now!!” one enthused, while another claimed they would be scrimping on food in order to pay for a pass to the three-day event. For those unable to get their hands on a ticket, the shows will stream on the festival’s official YouTube channel. Last year’s event was headlined by Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia.
