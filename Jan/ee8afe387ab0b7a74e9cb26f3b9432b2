A tense encounter between Rep. Lauren Boebert and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was caught on camera as the House voted on Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid to become speaker— sparking speculation that the Colorado lawmaker told her GOP colleague to get the “f–k out of my face,” according to a report. Greene, a McCarthy supporter, had confronted Boebert on Friday night after McCarthy failed on the 14th ballot over four days to win the speaker’s gavel as the California Republican’s supporters pressed members to vote yes. “You need to stop,” Greene appeared to tell Boebert, one of a group of about 20 hardline conservatives who had been voting against McCarthy. Video widely shared online captured Boebert, sitting next to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, responding before turning away and ignoring Greene. What she said isn’t audible, but some on Twitter speculated it looked like she had cussed at her colleague, The Daily Mail reported. “I’m not a expert lip reader, but I think Boebert told MTG to ‘the f–k out of my face,'” a user wrote along with a clip of the encounter in a tweet that had garnered more than 60,000 views by Sunday. The testy exchange was caught by C-Span cameras that had been showing the chamber over the past several days during the voting process. But the video captured by the cameras does not include sound. The verbal altercation happened around the time ​Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) had to be restrained after he lunged at Gaetz for opposing McCarthy. Gaetz voted “present” in the 14th round of voting to derail McCarthy’s bid for the gavel again Friday evening, even as others in the “Never Kevin” contingent began voting for the California Republican. McCarthy went on to win the speakership on a 15th ballot early Saturday morning. Boebert voted “present” on the 14th and 15th ballots. Reps for Boebert and Greene didn’t immediately return requests for comment Sunday.
