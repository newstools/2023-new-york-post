This home is not for the faint of heart. A Los Angeles mansion built on 60-foot caissons on famed Mulholland Drive has hit the market for $16 million. Known as the Garcia House, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom property was last sold by actor Vincent Gallo in 2002 for $1.2 million. The longtime owners are William Damaschke —  the former President of Animation and Family Entertainment for Skydance Media — and John McIlwee, a top Hollywood business manager. Built in 1962, the home was designed by world-renowned architect, John Lautner, and has since been labeled an “iconic masterpiece.” The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the listing this month. The stilts elevate the home for optimal canyon and city views, and has undergone a series of historical restorations over the years. Damaschke and McIlwee invested another $1 million on renovations — and added a fence to obstruct public views from the street into the glass-sided, transparent part of the home. Features include a lava rock entryway, original terrazzo flooring and a parabolic roof with 55-foot walls of windows, the listing says. Occupying roughly 2,600 square feet, the home also features a verdant garden and a pool that was added to the structure in 2008, using Lautner’s original design. The home has also been referred to as the “Rainbow House,” for its roof that lays on top of  stained glass windows and a curved ceiling that rises 30 feet high. The home was initially designed for Russell Garcia — an American composer who wrote a wide variety of music. Aaron Kirman with AKGRE Inc holds the listing.
