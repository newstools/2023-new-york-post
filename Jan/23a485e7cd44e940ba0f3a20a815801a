A deep sea fisherman from Russia has discovered a bizarre sea creature with a bloated, puffy mouth that hooked fans swear looks like botched lip fillers. Roman Fedortsov, from Murmansk, said he caught the fish while on his commercial boat in the Norwegian and Barents seas. He typically lures cod, haddock and mackerel to sell, but often finds unusual and unexpected marine life, which he presents to his 643,000 Instagram followers. In a post this week, he shared a video of the creature with a larger-than-life “trout pout,” which reeled in 11,000 likes. His outlandish catch was made on New Year’s Day, and cheeky Instagram users have been comparing the bug-eyed beauty to celebrities with botched cosmetic procedures. One person carped: “When lip fillers go wrong.” “Well, that’s terrifying,” another user hammered. “I thought that was an outtake from the Kardashians,” a third schooled. Another user snapped: “Trout pout.” “Your face on the morning after New Year,” clowned someone else. One helpful commenter floated an explanation as to why the fish was so puffy: “Deep sea fish bloating due to compression near the surface. It goes back to normal when it’s back in the deep oceans, it’s like when we go deep we feel the pressure. With this fish, it feels the pressure when it is reaching the surface.” But another person dragged a key component of that theory: “Yes, except the part about it going back to normal. That fish is dead.” Jam Press notes the fish remains unidentified, with Fedortsov unsure of the species. The Post reached out to him for comment. His freaky finds have included a “baby dragon”; a “testicle” fish; a crab with human teeth; and a “Frankenstein” fish.
