The Panthers’ coaching search did not get off to an ideal start, at least in the NFL’s eyes. As of Jan. 17, the Panthers were in violation of NFL hiring rules in their quest for a new head coach, per multiple reports. Nicole Tepper, who is the wife of Panthers owner David Tepper and Chief Administrative Officer of Tepper Sports & Entertainment, failed to complete the inclusive hiring training required to be a part of the team’s search committee. This week, five candidates interviewed for the head coaching vacancy, which opened after the firing of Matt Rhule. The NFL has not commented publicly on the issue, but did provide a statement about the rule in question. “The inclusive hiring training is a key element of our efforts to foster an equitable hiring process. Any suggestion that this mandatory requirement was not met by applicable clubs will be addressed and corrected immediately,” NFL SVP and chief diversity and inclusion officer, Jonathan Beane. The decision comes about a year after former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores filed a lawsuit against the league and its teams for discriminatory hiring practices against black head coaches and executives. Steve Wilks, who was promoted to Panthers interim coach after Rhule’s firing, was also added as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Wilks is a candidate for the job, along with Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey, former Colts head coach Frank Reich, former Lions head coach Jim Caldwell, Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka. The NFL holds these inclusive hiring requirements to “go well beyond the Rooney Rule” and to make “the game stronger and more inclusive.” The Panthers remain one of five NFL teams with a head-coaching opening.
