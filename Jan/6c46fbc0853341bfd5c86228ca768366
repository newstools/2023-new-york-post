Primo Spears scored 21 points and Georgetown snapped a record 29-game Big East losing streak under embattled head coach Patrick Ewing with an 81-76 victory over DePaul on Tuesday night in Washington. The Hoyas won for the first time in Big East play since March 13, 2021, when they beat Creighton to capture the conference tournament championship. The win Tuesday, which ended the longest skid in the history of the conference, also snapped a 10-game losing streak this season. After the surprise conference title, the Hoyas finished 0-19 in the Big East last season, leading to calls for Georgetown legend Ewing to be fired. “I take my hat off to these guys, they continue to fight,” Ewing, the former Knicks star, said after the Hoyas’ most-recent loss, Saturday at Xavier. “They have not given up. They have not quit.” Akok Akok and Brandon Murray each scored 12 points for the Hoyas (6-15, 1-9), who trailed 37-36 at halftime. — with AP
