A Planned Parenthood sex educator has been making TikTok videos that teach kids how to obtain sex toys and how to use fruits, vegetables and other objects as substitutes. Mariah Caudillo, who has more than 418,000 followers on the social media platform, has shared clips demonstrating how “spicy toys” can be fashioned out of innocent produce while suggesting video game controllers and electric toothbrushes can be used as stand-ins for actual sex toys, The Daily Mail reported. Caudillo has addressed questions about sex and contraception she says she’s received from middle and high schoolers. The educator had no qualms about gearing her lessons toward a younger audience by saying, “it’s not illegal to buy spicy toys online, even as a teen, which most people do. You just have to purchase them with a valid credit card, debit card, or gift card.” Caudillo works for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, the largest affiliate of the pro-choice organization, which provides health and education services to more than 220,000 people every year at more than 30 locations in mid-California and northern Nevada, according to her now-deleted LinkedIn account, Fox News reported. She made her TikTok account, @sexedfiles, private Saturday. On her Instagram account, which has 11,000 followers and is also private, Caudillo says she “advocates for trauma-informed, pleasure-centered, shame-free, comprehensive sex ed!”
