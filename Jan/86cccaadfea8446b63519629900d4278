Kevin Costner may not be willing to give up his “Yellowstone” ranch in Montana, but he is saying welcome to his real-life ranch in Colorado. The recent Golden Globe winner is renting his 160-acre Aspen estate for a colossal $36,000 per night, The Post has learned. The property went up for rent last week. Comprising 12 bedrooms and eight bathrooms, the spread occupies nearly 6,000 square feet. Known as the Dunbar Ranch, it has been pegged as “the ultimate luxury retreat,” and is located just minutes from downtown Aspen. Features of the property include 24/7 caretakers on site, a baseball field, a sledding hill, three hot tubs and the ability to sleep up to 27 people comfortably. Costner usually rents out the home during the winter months. He last listed the property for lease in 2021. Costner, 68, purchased the land in 2000 before transforming it into the property it is today. Amy Mottier with Coldwell Banker Mason Morse holds the listing. Costner, plays John Dutton — the owner of the Yellowstone ranch — on Paramount. Rumors surfaced on Friday as to whether Season 5 of the highly popular series would be Costner’s last in playing his acclaimed role. Costner is now working on a vast four-part movie titled “Horizon,” which he is producing, directing and starring in. The Post has reached out to Costner’s reps for comment.
