From coast to coast, this baby’s name is raising eyebrows. Orange County, California, mom Calyn Breann revealed in a now-viral TikTok that not everyone is as wild about her son’s unusual moniker — Coast — as she is. In the six-second TikTok, which has been viewed 1 million times, Breann holds baby Coast under a note that reads: “You should have named him something different, his name won’t age well.” “I love my baby coast!!!!” the mom captioned the post. Though Breann noted her infant’s unique name has drawn negative comments, several TikTokers gave it a sand-ing ovation. “Coast is a great name!” one user enthused. “Coast is so adorable, and it fits him so well,” agreed another. “I like that name. Nothing wrong with it. There’s a lot worse,” added a third. “As someone who loves the beach, I would 100% name my kid this,” offered someone else. Others advised the blond beauty not to harbor a grudge. “Name your baby what you want,” one TikToker recommended. “Don’t worry about what others say.” Coast was the 3,225th most popular baby boy name last year, according to Baby Center data, and it has been rising in popularity since 2018 among the site’s users. Breann, who often posts about her life as a young mom since giving birth in late October, said her baby boy loves his name — but she has an idea if he changes his mind when he grows up. “[He] smiles every time I call him Coast!” she gushed in a comment. “And his middle name is Jackson. He can always ask to be called Jackson when he is older.”
