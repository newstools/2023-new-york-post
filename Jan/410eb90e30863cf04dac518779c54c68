A teenage pilot saved his life and the lives of three passengers when he made an emergency landing onto Route 66 in California Monday morning after his small plane lost power. Brock Peters, 18, was flying a single-engine plane with family members onboard when he said he heard a pop from the engine while flying above Cajon Pass just before 10 a.m., KTLA reported. Peters was soaring over the pass between two large mountain ranges — the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains — when he realized he had no other choice but to land, he told Inland News. “At that point I didn’t have any space or time to get to any other airports and this was my only option, my only shot to get it down,” Peters told the outlet. He began the descent, maneuvered the aircraft under power lines and safely touched down on Cajon Boulevard near Matthews Ranch Road, according to VVNG. Peters landed the plane without causing any damage to the aircraft. He and three family members — who he was flying to Riverside Municipal airport for breakfast — onboard the plane were unharmed. The teenager said he was able to keep his mind at ease instead of panicking, which helped him complete the landing without issue. “Just got to stay calm, remember my training and just put the plane down and make sure everyone is safe,” he said.
