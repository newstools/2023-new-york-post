Let lust rule. That pretty much sums up how Jennifer Coolidge felt about having a bird’s-eye view of co-star Lenny Kravitz’s room while filming their new movie “Shotgun Wedding” — premiering Jan. 27 on Amazon Prime — in the Dominican Republic. “Lenny Kravitz had a room that [you could see] out my balcony,” Coolidge, 61, told “Access Hollywood” at the Los Angeles premiere of the romantic comedy — starring Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel as a couple having a drama-filled destination wedding — on Wednesday night. “It, like, zeroed in it somehow. The point of view was just on Lenny’s balcony so I saw everything … He’s so sexy.” And the award-winning “White Lotus” actress wasn’t shy about peeping on the 58-year-old rock star behind hits such as “Are You Gonna Go My Way,” “Fly Away” and, of course, “Let Love Rule.” In fact, she dished on the details about his private, um, place. “He does have a guitar, but he also has a ghetto blaster [boombox] with the best music because he has his compilation of music on his ghetto blaster,” said Coolidge. “I was hoping he would give me one of those tapes … I’m gonna ask him tonight [for a tape]. He’s here tonight. I’m gonna ask him for a lot of things.” Clearly, Coolidge — who in the past two weeks has picked up both a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for her “White Lotus” role as Tanya McQuiod — had the hots for Kravitz, calling him the “definition of cool.”
