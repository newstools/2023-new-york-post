A Vikings fan was gifted a touchdown ball after flipping off a Giants player during Sunday’s NFC Wild Card game. The young fan, who was sitting behind the goalpost in a Vikings suite, made two cameos on the Fox broadcast — with his first appearance including a double-bird to Giants receiver Isaiah Hodgins. With just over a minute left in the first quarter, Giants quarterback Daniel Jones connected with Hodgins on a 14-yard touchdown. Hodgins then spiked the ball and appeared to yell something in the direction of the young fan, who is seen throwing two middle fingers in the air. Then, with 45 seconds to play before halftime, Vikings receiver K.J. Osborn scored a touchdown — and gave the ball to the same fan sitting in the front row at U.S. Bank Stadium. This time, the fan celebrated the touchdown and gave Osborn a helmet tap before he ran back on the field. Osborn’s 9-yard touchdown catch from Kirk Cousins cut the Giants’ lead to three points going into the half, 17-14. The Vikings would tie the game early in the fourth quarter after falling behind by 10 early in the third, but Saquon Barkley’s 2-yard touchdown was the difference in the Giants’ 31-24 victory. The win marked the Giants’ first playoff victory since they defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI 11 years ago. The Giants now have a matchup against the rival Eagles, the No. 1 seed, in the divisional round Saturday night.
