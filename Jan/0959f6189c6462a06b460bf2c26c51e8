Henrik Lundqvist was feeling the love Tuesday night from two very famous admirers. While watching the Rangers take on the Minnesota Wild at Madison Square Garden, New York’s beloved former goalie received a playful peck on the cheek from “Succession” actor Alexander Skarsgård, whom he was seated next to, during the second period. Not to be outdone by Skarsgård, Ryan Reynolds — who was also seated next to the 40-year-old Lundqvist — went on to smooch his neighbor, which ignited cheers from fans. Skarsgård and Reynolds, both 46, weren’t the only celebs who were spotted at The Garden on Tuesday, as “Strangers Things” star David Harbour was also seen cheering on the Blueshirts in a Mika Zibanejad jersey. Lundqvist’s famous fan club picked the right night to check out the Rangers, who stormed back from a 2-0 deficit to top Minnesota, 4-3, after a shootout. “Sometimes you have to work for the luck,” Rangers center Filip Chytil said postgame. “Maybe it’s not luck, it’s just working. Sometimes it’s coming easier, sometimes you have to work a little harder, but today we play good consistently the whole game and I think we deserved the two points.” The Rangers now stand at 23-12-7 and are currently third in the Metropolitan Division. Lundqvist spent his entire NHL career with the Rangers, whom he played for from 2005 through 2020.
