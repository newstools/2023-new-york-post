As Rihanna would say, “This Is What You Came For.” Rihanna, 34, reminded her fans that her 2023 Super Bowl halftime performance is just around the corner. The National Football League posted a video of Rihanna wearing a Fenty-branded football hoodie that she first posted to her Instagram story. “[Five] weeks from today,” her Instagram post teased. The hoodie featured the iconic photo that she used to announce she would be taking the stage during the halftime performance and is part of a limited-edition Savage X Fenty Game Day collection. The line features hoodies, sweatpants, boxers, beanies, jerseys and hats. She’s even selling a shirt that reads: “Rihanna concert interrupted by a football game, weird but whatever.” Rihanna announced in September that she would be performing in the newly rebranded Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, which will be produced by DPS, with Roc Nation and Jesse Collins as executive producers and Hamish Hamilton as director. The “Love on the Brain” singer was previously approached to do the halftime show for Super Bowl 2019 in Atlanta, but turned it down due to the NFL controversy surrounding Colin Kaepernick. “I couldn’t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler,” Rihanna told Vogue in October 2019. “There’s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.” Super Bowl 2023 will take place Feb. 12 in Glendale, Arizona.
