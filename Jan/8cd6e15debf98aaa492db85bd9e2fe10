Whoa, baby! A TikToker says she was unable to take her newborn daughter home in any of the clothes she had packed for the hospital because she was too chubby. Beth Woods, who goes by the username @bethw961 on TikTok, revealed the mortifying mishap in a viral video that has delivered more than 355,000 views. In the 12-second clip, Woods wears a pair of black sunglasses as she smirks at the camera with dramatic music playing in the background, writing, “Me packing size 1 nappies and newborn clothes in my hospital bag.” She then shows her full-sized newborn, sharing, “My chunk going straight to size 2 and 0-3 month clothes…,” accompanied by a crying-laughing emoji. Newborn clothes are typically meant to fit babies who weigh between five and eight pounds, according to What To Expect. However, Woods’ experience appears to be quite common, as many commenters claimed their newborns were also part of the heavy infantry. “Same here,” one TikToker replied. “Had all newborn clothes, and she was 9 lbs 3oz and straight into 0-3 months.” Another mom named Becky agreed, writing, “All 3 of mine went straight into 0-3 clothes. My third baby was in 3-6 clothes by just 6 weeks old  he was long!” One user even claimed to fix the hospital clothes on the fly for the baby, as his legs didn’t fit into them. “Had to cut the feet out of all the newborn clothes I took to hospital as his legs were so long,” the parent revealed. In the comments section, Woods divulged her child was a little over nine pounds at birth. Some commenters actually had the opposite problem — their babies were too small for the newborn clothes. “I had this the other way,” one viewer disclosed. “I was told I was going to have a 9-lb baby and he came 3 wks early at 6lb 4oz. Everyone was running out to get newborn [clothes] for me.” Another chimed in, “Same but everything was too big! I had to get my mum and auntie to rush out getting tiny baby clothes and size 0s.”
