It’s the sisterhood of the traveling crown. Former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo, 30, said she’s caught her sisters, Sophia, 26, and Aurora, 33, playing dress-up with her diamond tiara. “My crown has its own special clear box that I keep in my closet, locked. Although I have caught my sisters walking around with it in my house before — so maybe I need to hide the key,” Culpo told The Post. The brunette bombshell will be at the helm of tonight’s pageant in New Orleans —  streaming on Roku between 8 and 10 p.m. — with Jeannie Mai Jenkins, host of the talk show “The Real.” The 2012 Miss Universe — who lives with sister Sophia in a Los Angeles mansion featured on MTV’s “Cribs” — still has the dress, bathing suit, and gown she wore in the competition over a decade ago. “It’s so fun to look back on those pieces as mementos. I am not sure I will ever get rid of them honestly,” said the multitasking Culpo, who also debuted the TLC reality show “The Culpo Sisters” with her siblings last November. Before winning Miss Universe, Culpo, who is dating San Francisco 49ers star running back Christian McCaffrey, was crowned Miss Rhode Island, then Miss USA. One memory was not so fun. While competing for Miss USA, a fellow contestant gave her purple dress a backhanded compliment. She “told me on the day of the pageant that my dress looked like Barney. And I still remember it to this day.” But Culpo’s beauty and talent won the day. The accomplished cellist says one of her New Year’s resolutions is to “play more chamber music with my quartet.” Saturday night’s broadcast will feature 84 contestants from around the globe. Many eyes will be on Miss Ukraine, Viktoria Apanasenko, who recently made headlines for her “Warrior of Light” costume. She explained the meaning behind it on Instagram, saying “we wanted to put the idea that war cannot break our strength and discolor our hearts.”
