One year after their Urban Meyer debacle, the Jaguars are playoff-bound. But their turnaround from 3-14 to 9-8 may not have required a complete overhaul. “I think one person was broken. It wasn’t us,” wide receiver Marvin Jones told reporters, per ESPN, on Saturday night after the Jaguars beat the Titans to clinch the AFC South. The Jaguars fired Meyer last December, 13 games into his first season in Jacksonville. They replaced him with Doug Pederson, the former Super Bowl-winning coach of the Eagles, and are now back in the playoffs for the first time since 2017. Meyer’s tenure with the Jaguars was filled with controversy and plenty of unhappy players. It included a video of Meyer, the day after an October loss in Cincinnati, sitting at a bar with a young woman who was not his wife dancing close to his lap, which led to a public reprimand from owner Shad Khan. Then, in December, kicker Josh Lambo accused Meyer of repeatedly kicking his leg during warmups and verbally abusing him, allegedly telling him, “I’m the head ball coach, I’ll kick you whenever the f–k I want.” By the next day, Meyer was fired. Jones, who also reportedly had an argument with Meyer after the coach criticized the wide receiver group, said this season that he knew early on Meyer would not work in the NFL. “Around like the second week of camp,” Jones said on the “Open Mike” podcast in October, regarding when he knew things weren’t working with Meyer. “You know, the vibes and like the meetings. You know, if you said one thing, it wouldn’t be true. I was like ‘Look, everybody in the league we all have phones and we can all fact-check.’ Just be real. That’s one of the big things, somebody that’s transparent and somebody that’s real, that actually, you know, tells us the truth. Especially in this day in age, because you can look up everything and see if it was right or not.”
