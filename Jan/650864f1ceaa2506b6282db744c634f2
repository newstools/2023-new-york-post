The Wildcat returns for his 26th NFL season in The Post. Including the 1997-2022 seasons in the Bettor’s Guide, Cat’s record in print stands at 674-582 (53.87 percent) against the spread. The Vikings have enjoyed a sparkling, sustained seasonal run, and good for them. We’ve seen that spiking levels of performance are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. Often, such are vulnerable to correction when up against a side like Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, who may arguably be superior. At least Kirk Cousins has been decent, but this looks to be a marked step up the scale, and Minnesota continues to face multiple points to prove. Clash of the titans? Without a doubt. But with Cincinnati’s muscular modern history catching points at home, no way we’re going to fade Wunderkind QB Joe Burrow given the Bills’ previous disappointing postseason history. Here, also, performance level limits can exist, especially when up against sides which are more than capable defending against hot form into the postseason. Burrow is demonstrably the real deal We’re confident he can sustain superior performances, and the Bills’ sustained futile chase of an elusive Super Bowl title casts an increasingly long shadow. Last week: 1-1. Steelers (W). Seahawks (L)2022 season: 16-15-1.
