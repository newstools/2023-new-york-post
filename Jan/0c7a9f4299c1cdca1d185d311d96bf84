Kanye West wedded Yeezy designer Bianca Censori in a secret ceremony Thursday, according to reports. The new couple reportedly went on a romantic getaway at a five-star luxury resort in Utah last week. Their lavish honeymoon took place at the Amangiri in Canyon Point, Utah, which has 34 suites and one four-bedroom Mesa home. It’s located on 600 acres in the Grand Circle of National Parks and Monuments. Rooms range from $3,300 to $6,400 — with an average “suite” rate of $5,000. Prices for the freestanding home property — a 5,853-square-foot villa — are not disclosed to the general public. West and Censori took advantage of the luxury spot’s 25,000-square-foot Aman Spa for treatments based on the healing philosophies of the native Navajo, the Daily Mail first reported. The Post reached out to representatives for Amangiri resort. While it doesn’t appear the pair’s marriage is technically legal as they have yet to file a marriage certificate, according to TMZ, they were spotted with their new rings as they arrived at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills on Thursday. Censori is an architectural designer at West’s brand, Yeezy. According to her LinkedIn profile, she’s been in the role for just over two years, since November 2020. She’s estimated to be nearly 27 years old — about 15 years younger than West — according to an interview she gave to iD magazine in 2016. It’s unknown exactly when the two met or when their relationship started, but given that Censori started working at Yeezy in November 2020, it’s assumed that they met sometime around her date of hire. The 45-year-old rapper released a song in December titled “Censori Overload” — an apparent tribute to his new leading lady. The marriage comes shortly after West and Kim Kardashian, 42, settled their divorce after almost seven years of marriage.
