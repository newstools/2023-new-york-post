“The View” had a bit of a messy interruption during Wednesday’s show. The talk show started out discussing the classified documents that were recently discovered at former Vice President Mike Pence’s Indiana home. But right as they started getting into the thick of it, the scene took a turn for the worse. As Alyssa Farah Griffin began to speak, a liquid on the other side of the table started to leak. Whoopi Goldberg pointed out to co-host Sara Haines that something was dripping, and as Haines looked down to see, she moved a little in her seat while what appeared to be a fart noise sounded on the mic. “We had a little spillage on the other side of the table,” Griffin said, laughing and seeming a little flustered. “Now it’s on my pants,” Haines said as she and Goldberg tried to clean up the leakage. Neither the spill nor the mysterious flatulent noise was mentioned again. This wasn’t the first time “The View” hosts have dealt with unwanted disruptions on set. Last year, Joy Behar face-planted in front of the audience — which caused the show to unveil new chairs on set. More recently, Goldberg was heckled by an audience member who called her an “old broad” on live television. “I am an old broad, and happy about it,’ ” the EGOT-winner responded.
