Exhibitionists will love this listing. A three-bedroom property asking $150,000 for sale in the United Kingdom has gone viral for the unique placement of one of its bathrooms. Just outside Manchester, in the English town of Failsworth, this quaint brick home seems normal enough — with black window cornices, paned glass windows and decently sized bedrooms. And then there’s the toilet on the porch. Described in the listing as “a downstairs external W.C.,” the bizarre bathroom setup is located in a windowed chamber within the back garden, which anyone could look right into. Although the windows aren’t floor-to-ceiling, they wrap around the corner of this oddly placed bathroom — and without any curtains or blinds, it all leaves little privacy for when nature calls. In addition to its unusual location, the pictured toilet and the floor below it are also quite dirty, and insulation is visible through a wall panel. “Saw this on Rightmove. So now you have to too,” wrote one observer of the property, which is listed on the real estate company’s website. The listing copy hardly acknowledges the strangeness of the situation, and doesn’t note it at all beyond stating that the loo is external. The home has been seeking a buyer since late October. “Welcome to the market this period end of terraced, which would be described as a tardis,” begins the listing. “The property has a double extension to the rear making this a more substantial home which would suit a variety of buyers.” It goes on to note that, in addition to the backyard powder room, there is also a “family bathroom” upstairs. There’s also an entrance hall, an open-plan dining room with a fireplace, an office, a backyard and external off-road parking. Only cash buyers are being considered.
