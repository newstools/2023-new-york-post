That’s a lot of birthday candles to tweet. María Branyas Morera of Spain, who — was verified as being the oldest living person at 115 years and 321 days old, is an active Twitter user, according to Guinness World Records. The spry senior’s Twitter bio reads, “I am old, very old, but not an idiot,” and she frequently shares her words of wisdom on the social media platform with the help of her daughter. The octogenarian took on the impressive title of world’s oldest living person this week, after the death of French nun Lucile Randon, aka Sister Andre, at age 118 on Tuesday. A San Francisco native, Morera was born in 1907, one year after her parents emigrated to the States. However, they returned to Spain eight years later, settling in the northeastern region of Catalonia, where Morera still lives. For the past 22 years, she has lived at the Residència Santa María del Tura nursing home. “She is in good health and continues to be surprised and grateful for the attention that this anniversary has generated,” the home said in a statement. “To celebrate this very special event we will have a small celebration behind closed doors in the residence in the coming days.” Morera, whose late husband, Joan Moret, was a doctor, has three children, 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. In 2020, she made headlines as the world’s oldest COVID-19 survivor but was later dethroned by Randon. This New Year’s Day, Morera took to Twitter to say, “Life is not eternal for anyone… At my age, a new year is a gift, a humble celebration, a new adventure, a beautiful journey, a moment of happiness. Let’s enjoy life together.”
