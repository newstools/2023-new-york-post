An ugly scene unfolded outside of AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday as the Cowboys lost to the 49ers in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs. In footage shared on Twitter by the Dallas Texas TV account, some Cowboys fans can be seen trading punches as a crowd walks away from the venue, which hosted a watch party for the game earlier in the day at the Miller Lite House on the stadium grounds. Warning: Graphic content At one point in the video, an onlooker can be seen tossing the contents of a drink in the direction of a brawler. As the clip continues, it appears security attempted to separate some of those involved. A separate incident appeared to break out near a concession stand, according to a different video shared Sunday by the Dallas Texas TV account, with security personnel quickly responding to the scene. Warning: Graphic content The Cowboys didn’t play at home on Sunday and were on the road instead, falling to the 49ers at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., 19-12. San Francisco now advances to the NFC Championship next week, when they’ll visit the Eagles in Philadelphia. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott struggled early, throwing a pair of interceptions in the first half. Things continued to get worse for Dallas, when running back Tony Pollard exited the game early with an ankle injury. Dallas finished the regular season at 12-5.
