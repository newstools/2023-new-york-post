The University of Idaho student who told cops she saw an intruder in her house the morning of the quadruple homicide there was “scared to death,” a lawyer for one of the victims’ families said Saturday. Dylan Mortensen, 21, reported seeing an unknown “figure clad in black clothing and a mask” walking past her, towards the home’s back exit, just after 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, although police were not summoned to the home for eight hours. “She was scared. She was scared to death, and rightly so,” Shanon Gray, a lawyer for victim Kaylee Goncalves’ family, told Fox News. “This guy had just murdered four people in the home.” Bryan Kohberger, 28, was charged with killing Goncalves, 21, and roommates Madison Mogen, 21; and Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle’s boyfriend Ethan Chapin, 20, Gray said the description Mortensen provided to police was “beneficial.” “She’s a victim in this case. Everybody kind of forgets that,” Gray said. “The Goncalves family doesn’t have any ill will towards her or anything like that.” Mortensen locked her bedroom door after seeing the intruder and neither she nor roommate Bethany Funke, 21, called the police until noon. Police think the four students were killed between 4 and 4:25 a.m.  An Idaho law enforcement source told The Post that the reporting delay was something investigators had puzzled over and that, “we don’t know if it was an issue of intoxication, or of fear.”
