The mother of the madman who killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, spent two days in jail on allegations she threatened to kill the disabled man she was living with, according to multiple reports. Adriana Martinez Reyes, 40, was charged with assault and battery and uttering death threats Wednesday, and jailed in Oklahoma City, where she was living with the man, identified as VI Alvarez, authorities said. It’s not clear what led to the confrontation. She relocated to Oklahoma City after the massacre, according to the San Antonio Express News. She spent two days behind bars, unable to make the $1,000 bond, but was released Friday afternoon after a judge tossed the charges, the paper reported. Reyes denied to the responding police officer that she had threatened to kill Alvarez, but a witness corroborated Alvarez’s story, according to KBTX, a CBS affiliate. Reyes is the mother of Salvador Ramos, 18, who opened fire on students and teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde last year. Ramos was killed by police. The Uvalde native was involved with her son’s life when he was a child but their relationship “became strained”  as the attacker grew older and she combated issues with drugs and other personal matters, according to the Texas House of Representatives report on the shooting at Robb Elementary School. Reyes, who defended her son and claimed last year that Ramos “had his reasons for doing what he did,” was also arrested in Uvalde in June for criminal trespassing and driving without a valid license, according to reports.
