The Miami Dolphins travel to Buffalo on Sunday with a good news/bad news scenario going. The good news is, Miami made the playoffs in coach Mike McDaniel’s first season. The bad news is, the Dolphins are down to their third-string quarterback, Skylar Thompson. Buffalo opened as around a 9.5-point favorite in this matchup, but ballooned up to 13.5 once it was announced Thompson would get the start. Though these teams played two tight games in the regular season, it’s hard to come up with a scenario in which we will see a third. Even with two stud receivers, Miami’s offense isn’t close to the same when Tua Tagovailoa doesn’t play. I’m not a big fan of laying close to two touchdowns in a playoff game. Instead, I’m looking at another way to attack this game. I like Bills running back James Cook to go over 37.5 rushing yards. That number is a little low for a guy who has become a bigger part of Buffalo’s offense in recent weeks. Cook’s production has picked up over the past seven games, in which he has gone over 34 yards five times and finished with double-digit carries three times. In his past two games (not counting the canceled contest against the Bengals), Cook has gained 144 yards on 20 carries. The key to this bet is the Bills having a lead in the second half. In that scenario, I expect Cook to easily eclipse 10 rushing attempts going up against a worn-out Dolphins defense. Finally, Cook’s longest rush has been 10-plus yards in five of his past seven games. If that trend continues, we would only need a few carries to hit this Over. The play: James Cook Over 37.5 rushing yards.
