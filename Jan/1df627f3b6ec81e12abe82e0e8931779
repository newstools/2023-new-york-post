The Mahomes men love a celebratory cigar. After the Chiefs defeated the Bengals in the AFC Championship game on Sunday, Patrick Mahomes’ family partied the night away, according to social media posts by his wife, Brittany Matthews, and his brother, Jackson Mahomes. The quarterback’s father, former MLB pitcher Pat Mahomes, lit a cigar in a private suite at Arrowhead Stadium, where the celebrations began following Kansas City’s 23-20 win over Cincinnati. “Light that s–t, baby, light it,” Matthews can be heard screaming in a video she shared on her Instagram Story. Jackson was also featured hugging his dad from behind in the clip, which showed a group of Chiefs supporters partying in the suite. “That’s my God damn son,” the elder Mahomes, 52, said in a separate video shared by his daughter-in-law. Pat eventually made his way down to the field, where he was asked about his now-viral cigar moment. “I’m smoking on the Joe Burrow,” Pat said in reference to the Bengals quarterback, who is widely known for his post-victory cigar. “It feels great [to be headed back to the Super Bowl]. My baby boy did what he always do, he’s gonna show up and show out and I’m just glad he did it.” Mahomes’ marketing agent, Jacquelyn Dahl, later shared a photo of the 27-year-old quarterback riding in a party bus beside Matthews. The Chiefs star was pictured holding a Coors Light while his wife posed with a BioSteel drink — the sports nutrition company that Mahomes became a partner with in 2020. The festivities eventually transitioned to a private after-party with music by DJ EV, according to Jackson’s Instagram Story. Matthews posted a photo taking shots while Jackson shared a selfie of the pair. Mahomes and Matthews’ daughter, Sterling Skye — who turns 2 next month  — was present at Sunday’s game and dressed in Chiefs gear. The couple welcomed a son, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III, in November. The Chiefs will face the Eagles at State Farm Stadium in Arizona on Feb. 12.
