Olivia Culpo’s wild weekend in Las Vegas continued Sunday, when she made it just in time to catch boyfriend Christian McCaffrey’s 49ers game after an eventful night out. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum, 30, who rang in the New Year on Saturday with Claire Kittle and Kristin Juszczyk, the wives of 49ers stars George Kittle and Kyle Juszczyk, recapped the night in a TikTok video as she got ready aboard a party bus solo after sleeping in. “Remember yesterday when I was like, ‘I just don’t do Vegas,’ it’s because I don’t know how,” Culpo said. Warning: Explicit language “Last night was just crazy, we had to jump through barricades, we had to jump over fences,  we walked probably like three miles. It was just an absolute s–t show.” Culpo said she shut off her alarms around 8 a.m. and woke up a few hours later to a flurry of texts as everyone had already left for the game at Allegiant Stadium. “Everything’s fine, I’m on my way to the game, I’ll make it for kickoff. I’m in a party bus alone cause we had to send the car separately,” Culpo said. When Culpo arrived at the game, she sat with Juszczyk, who joked in an Instagram Story that they suffered an “L” in Las Vegas. “Vegas 1, Us 0,” Juszczyk posted. Later on Sunday, Juszczyk posted a video of Culpo resting on her shoulder with sunglasses on. “These girls can’t hang,” she quipped in a separate post. Culpo and company did see the 49ers top the Raiders in overtime, 37-34. She then got her New Year’s kiss from McCaffrey, 26. “Finally got my ’23 nye kiss,” Culpo shared in an Instagram Story. McCaffrey is in his first season with the 49ers after the Carolina Panthers traded the running back to San Francisco in October 2022. He and Culpo have been dating for more than three years.
