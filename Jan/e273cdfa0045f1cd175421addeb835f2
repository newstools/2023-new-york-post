This booty-baring beauty says there are no rules for how moms should dress — and she’s making sure everyone knows it. Krysta Feth took to TikTok last week to share a provocative video that showed her clad in a thong bikini while holding hands with her young son. The mother-of-four bent over in the skimpy garment, showing off her derriere and inciting outrage among some viewers. “Motherhood didn’t come with a dress code,” flesh-flashing Feth defiantly declared in the controversial clip which has clocked over 5 million views. In an additional caption, the brunette explained that she’s a dedicated, down-to-earth mom and that her clothing choice has no bearing on her parenting abilities. “I’m a homeschooling, crunchy, natural momma who’s built my entire existence around my children,” she stated. “I just also happen to be incredibly comfortable in my own skin.” Feth further claimed that her outfits might even encourage her young boy to be more open-minded in the future. ”I doubt my son will ever think to tell a woman what she should wear. He’s got a momma and 3 sisters,” she said.  “Lord knows I’m not for everyone and don’t care to be.” Despite being comfortable in her tiny clothing, Feth was hit with hate in the comments section beneath her video. “The amount of attention you need is very, very sad, friend,” one user declared. ”Nothing wrong with a little class,” another added. However, some users defended the hot mama, saying she’s allowed to wear whatever she wants. “You’re teaching your kids to be comfortable in their own skin and to be confident,” one cheered. “You keep doing you, mama!”
