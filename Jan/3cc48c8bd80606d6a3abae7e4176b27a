Los Angeles Chargers star Joey Bosa got a true Philly experience. Bosa went to Philadelphia’s 31-7 win over the 49ers on Sunday to witness his younger brother, San Francisco pass-rusher Nick Bosa, get eliminated from the 2023 NFL playoffs at Lincoln Financial Field  – and get berated by Eagles fans. In a video that surfaced on Twitter, Philadelphia fans heckled the Chargers linebacker, who sported a 49ers jacket in support of his brother, before kickoff. “Bosaaaaa,” fans could be heard yelling at the four-time Pro Bowler. “When do the Chargers play this week,” one fan said, referencing Bosa’s team that was embarrassingly eliminated in the wild-card round by the Jaguars, blowing a 27-point lead. Warning: Graphic language “You snapchatting your little butt buddies,” Bosa said as a comeback before he was ushered to walk away after more heckling. The Eagles fan then asked Bosa about the fines he accrued after the Jaguars loss, which the linebacker said were “fine” because he “can afford them.” He began to walk away but not before calling the fan a “broke bitch.” With the Eagles securing their spot in Super Bowl 2023, they will face the winner of the Bengals-Chiefs AFC Championship game.
