Hugh Grant was frankly “terrified” of a uniquely dressed fan who “stalked” him at Comic-Con. The 62-year-old actor and his “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” co-star Chris Pine, 42, relished about the memorable interaction in a recent interview with Collider. Grant admitted to being nervous onstage at San Diego Comic-Con in July because he’s “so old now” compared to the hunky Pine. “I’m passé, and I thought, ‘They’ll bring out Chris Pine, they’ll go mad,'” he said of the memable “Don’t Worry Darling” star. “They’ll bring out the others, they’ll go mad. And then they’ll say  ‘Hugh Grant,’ and there’ll be dead silence.” But as the story goes, Pine declared the crowd “f–king loved” Grant — especially one person in particular. “There was only one person at that convention who really loved me, and he was dressed for the whole three days as a hot dog,” Grant recalled. But the stalker wouldn’t get out of his grill. “And he followed me wherever I went. I couldn’t shake him. Do you remember the hot dog?” he asked Pine. “I was terrified. I still have nightmares about him.” “I know. That’s pretty great,” Pine replied. “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” hits theaters on March 3. [Warning: Major “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” spoiler ahead.] Elsewhere in the interview, Grant confirmed that he is “married to James Bond” — referring to actor Daniel Craig — in Netflix’s “Glass Onion.” Craig, 54, reprises his role as Benoit Blanc in the Rian Johnson-directed film. Admitting that his presence is a tiny cameo, Grant plays the detective’s husband, Phillip. “It’s the tiniest little moment. I don’t really know why they wanted to do it but anyway, I thought ‘Knives Out 1’ was brilliant, and so yeah, I thought why not? I turn up for a few hours …”
