Andrew Benintendi’s stint with the Yankees was brief, and by the sound of it, he is happy to have moved on to the White Sox. The outfielder — who played in just 33 games for the Yankees — was introduced by his new team on Wednesday, when he appeared to take a swipe at his old club in the process. “It’s fun to be part of something where you’re desired, where you’re wanted,” said Benintendi, who signed a five-year, $75 million deal with Chicago last month. The Yankees acquired Benintendi, 28, from the Royals on July 27 in exchange for three minor-league pitchers. Benintendi was fresh off his first All-Star appearance and among the league leaders in hitting, boasting a .320 average with 111 hits in 93 games for Kansas City last season before being dealt. Once in New York, though, the former Gold Glove winner — who was also a member of the Red Sox’s championship roster in 2018 — hit just .254 in 33 games before a broken right hand ended his season. Still, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said he wanted to bring Benintendi back. Although the Yankees valued his left-handed bat and left-field defense, the White Sox offer ultimately came along. “Benny’s a guy who came in here and fit in really well,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters in December after the news broke. “Obviously got hurt and had his season shortened, especially when he was really starting to play well for us.” As the Yankees continue their search for a left fielder, Benintendi is getting acclimated to his new home. “I’m looking forward to getting to know some guys, build relationships and get this thing going,” he said. “From Day 1 in the offseason, there was communication. There was constant interest throughout the entire process. I was talking about it with Petey [Grifol], [general manager] Rick [Hahn], and the rest of the front office. It’s good to be with a team that wanted me from Day 1.”
