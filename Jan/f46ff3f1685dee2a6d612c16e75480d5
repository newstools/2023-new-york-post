A 6-year-old boy shot and gravely injured a female teacher at an elementary school in Virginia  Friday and was taken into custody, authorities said. The teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News was rushed to a hospital with life-threatening injuries after the student opened fire at around 2 p.m., police told wtkr.com. The school was placed on lockdown and no students were injured, the outlet reported. The boy got into “an altercation” with the teacher before he allegedly pulled the trigger of a handgun, police and school officials told The Daily Press.com. Police recovered evidence from a single location where the shooting unfolded, Drew said in an interview with WAVY-TV 10. “We don’t have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting. We have a situation in one particular location where a gunshot was fired,” he said. “Everything right now is safe. The school has been cleared,” he added. By 3 p.m., there was no longer an active shooter and a reunification site was set up for parents near the school’s gym entrance, authorities said. The suspect’s name wasn’t immediately known Friday. A representative from the school didn’t immediately return The Post’s request for information Friday.
