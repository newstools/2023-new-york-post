The series was over in a flash. Familiar faces from “The Flash” — including actors David Ramsey, Keiynan Lonsdale and Sendhil Ramamurthy — will return for Episode 909 in the upcoming final season. The remaining 13 episodes make the series the last to take place in the Arrowverse — the DC Comics superhero TV franchise that has aired on The CW and other networks. “As one of the legacy Arrowverse characters who helped start it all, John Diggle holds a special place in our hearts, as well as the fans,” executive producer Eric Wallace said of Ramsey’s character — a k a the superhero Spartan — in a statement. “Plus, the commanding presence and commitment to excellence actor/director David Ramsey brings to the screen each and every time is truly inspiring,” Wallace continued. “So, of course, it was a no-brainer to have Diggle join Team Flash in our final season! So, get ready for a very emotional reunion as John Diggle aka Spartan helps protect Central City alongside Team Flash one, last time.” Lonsdale will reprise his role as Wally West, also known as Kid Flash, while Ramamurthy will return as Ramsey Rosso, a criminal who transformed himself into the villainous Bloodwork. Season 9, with series star Grant Gustin, premieres on Feb. 8 at 8 p.m. EST on The CW. As for DC Studios’ “The Flash” film — which stars embattled actor Ezra Miller and is expected to hit theaters on June 16 — fans will be disappointed to know that Henry Cavill’s cameo as Superman is reportedly being cut from the movie. Cavill additionally recently claimed that he was fired from reprising his role in future films by newly appointed studio execs James Gunn and Peter Safran. “My turn to wear the cap has passed, but what Superman stands for never will,” he said in an Instagram post last month. “It’s been a fun ride with you all, onwards and upwards.”
