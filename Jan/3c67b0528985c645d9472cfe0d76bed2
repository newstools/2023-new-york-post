Three people were arrested in connection to the slaying of a 17-year-old girl last spring, Denver police said Thursday. On March 26, Jasmine Rivas-Hernandez was found shot to death in an alley in the city’s Montclair neighborhood. Her legs had been found crossed at the ankles and tied with a pair of white headphones, according to a police affidavit shared with The Post. Nearly 10 months later, police arrested Robert Adam Solano, 34, Joseph Thomas Chavez, 26, and Shiloh Fresquez, 21 for their alleged roles in the teenager’s death. Police nailed the group after finding Chavez’s DNA in a stolen truck that was caught by surveillance footage driving down the alley hours before Jasmine was found, the documents state. Jasmine’s blood was also found in the car, police said. Fresquez and Solano, a couple, had been together at the time of the murder and just a few blocks away, their cellphone records show. According to the charges, Solano may have been the one to pull the trigger. He was the only one of the trio to be charged with first-degree murder. Solano and Chavez were both already in custody for unrelated charges when Denver police issued arrest warrants Tuesday. Chavez was slapped with accessory to a crime of first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse. Fresquez was arrested earlier this month for her connection to the killing, police said. She was charged with accessory to a crime of first-degree murder and attempt to influence a public servant by the Denver District Attorney’s Office. A motive for the killing has not yet been revealed by police. “We want answers. We want to know why this happened,” Diana Hernandez, Jasmine’s cousin, told 9 News shortly after the murder. “I don’t think there’s anything that she could have done or could have done to anyone for someone to kill her like that. It just makes no sense.”
