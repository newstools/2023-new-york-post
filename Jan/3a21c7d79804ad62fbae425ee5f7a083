A mom is getting a leg up on her fashion sense by copying her daughter’s sexy outfits. A TikTok influencer named Sasha Morpeth, 22, recently shared a video of her 61-year-old mom Therese wearing the same looks as her and wowing in them. “My 61-year-old mom tried on my new going-out outfits,” Morpeth said in her video, which has nearly 800,000 views and over 50,000 likes. In addition to sharing jeans, the mom-and-daughter duo have similar blond hairdos and look like they could be sisters. In the video, the pair strut around their home wearing three of Sasha’s outfits, including one containing a white crop top, a beige miniskirt and sandals. Another look consists of a lime-green floral minidress and the third has a cool, Y2K-era twist to it, with baggy ripped jeans and a white lace tank top. Morpeth and her mom might as well be identical because Sasha’s commenters couldn’t even tell them apart. “I suspected twins, not mom. Omg,” a shocked user wrote. Someone else chimed in: “You are both beautiful inside and out. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.” Mother-daughter fashion shoots are making their rounds on the internet and legendary supermodel Heidi Klum, 49, and her 18-year-old daughter Leni made headlines when they did a scandalous photoshoot together last October. That shoot inspired a mom of four from NYC named Sue, 50, to do a similar shoot with her youngest daughter, Julia Rae, 22. The two posed in various sets of lingerie last year. “It was such a beautiful and empowering experience to share with my daughter,” Sue told The Post. “I feel like I’m always trying to follow the rules of ‘How a mom is supposed to be,’” she added. “But I felt so strong and free and pretty and happy doing this.”
