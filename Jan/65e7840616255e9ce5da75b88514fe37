Kate Winslet went viral Sunday when a clip of her offering words of comfort to a first-time reporter hit Twitter. The 47-year-old actress appeared on the German television network ZDF for an interview with adolescent Martha to discuss her new film “Avatar: The Way of Water.” Martha, who is described as a “Kinderreporterin,” then revealed to the Oscar winner that it’s her first time interviewing someone. “Um, it’s my first time,” she said. It was then that Winslet leaned in and offered some encouraging words. “This is your first time doing it?” asked the “Titanic” actress. “Ok, well guess what? When we do this interview, it’s going to be the most amazing interview ever. And do you know why?” “Because we’ve decided that it’s going to be,” she said. The clip has gained nearly 1.8 million views since it was posted. “We’ve decided right now, me and you, that this is going to be a really fantastic interview,” the “Mare of Easttown” actress said. “You can ask me anything you want, and you don’t have to be scared.” “Everything’s gonna be amazing. Okay, you’ve got this,” Winslet said in her pep talk before taking a quick selfie with the young reporter. Twitter users immediately seized on the beautiful moment. “Kate Winslet reassuring this young girl that her interview will be amazing is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen,” said one user. “Protect Kate Winslet at all costs,” tweeted another. “I didn’t think I could love Kate Winslet more and then now I do,” a third person chimed in. “Avatar: The Way of Water” is now playing in theaters.
