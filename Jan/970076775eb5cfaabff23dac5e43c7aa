A blond beauty has been dress-coded on the slopes of a ski resort after she bared her booty in front of stunned children. The uninhibited influencer — who has not been publicly identified — was caught on camera being told off by a staff member at the family-friendly Big Sky resort in Montana over the weekend. In the footage, which was posted on the Instagram account @influencersinthewild, the scantily-clad skier was seen with her pants down, exposing her derriere in a black G-string onesie. “The mountain ranger had to go over and ask her to stop because there were kids around because IT’S A PUBLIC MOUNTAIN,” the account captioned the upload. The stunner was attempting to pose for a cheeky photo when she was reprimanded, as her male companion was seen crouched down in the snow trying to take the perfect shot. The footage prompted several to slam the sultry ski bunny for her antics, with one snidely stating: “Start charging them [influencers] with lewd and lascivious behavior.” Another quipped: “I want that kind of confidence and lack of awareness. I think I’d be a happier person …. lol!” “I hate our culture,” a third cynic simply stated. However, the unidentified influencer did have some supporters, with one male admirer remarking: “I bet the photo was fire.” “People act like buttcheeks are a forbidden sin,” another chimed in, accusing haters of being too prudish. The blond isn’t the only woman to be dress-coded for her inappropriate outfit at a family-friendly locale. Last November, one woman claimed she was allegedly told off for wearing a low-cut tank top to a Disney theme park. Meanwhile, a coffee-lover recently took to TikTok saying she was asked to leave her local Starbucks because of the tube top she was wearing.
