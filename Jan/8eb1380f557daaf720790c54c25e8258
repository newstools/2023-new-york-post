That joke slapped. Comedian Eddie Murphy revealed why he couldn’t pass up making fun of Will Smith’s infamous Oscar slap at Tuesday night’s Golden Globes. The 61-year-old comedian made the joke about the slap while accepting the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.” In his speech, he offered advice to those aspiring to enter the industry and achieve “success, prosperity, longevity and peace of mind.” “There’s three things: pay your taxes, mind your business and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out your f – – king mouth!” Murphy said during his acceptance speech. Murphy later told “Entertainment Tonight” in a backstage interview why he name-dropped the “Emancipation” actor. “I’ve worked with Jada,” explained Murphy. “I love Will. I love Will, and I love Chris — and it’s all love.” The “Nutty Professor” actor also thanked his family, various producers and his agents and reflected on his illustrious career. “I’ve been in show business for 46 years, and the movie business for 41 years, so this has been a long time in the making,” said Murphy. “I want to let you know there’s a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity and peace of mind. It’s very simple.” Murphy also spoke about how honored he was to be chosen for this award. “It’s a prestigious award. And like I said, when you receive stuff like this when you’re older,” mused Murphy. “You really appreciate it more. Now you do.”
