Jason Kelce isn’t against trash talk by any means. He is, however, when it’s towards a foe such as Dexter Lawrence. Kelce caught his Eagles teammate Brandon Graham targeting Lawrence during the coin toss ahead of their Divisional Round matchup with the Giants. “We running right at you, 9-7,” Graham yelled at the Giants’ star tackle. “And you know not to run this way!” Lawrence, a lover of smack talk himself, gave it right back to his rival. “I want that,” he told Graham. “I want that!” Aware of the damage Lawrence could inflict on him, Kelce revealed Thursday he had some advice for Graham. “I wasn’t happy about that,” Kelce told reporters. “I told him right after that, ‘Hey man, you talk s–t to the (offensive) tackle. I’ll handle this guy. I don’t need him more revved up than he already is.” Kelce got the better of Lawrence and Big Blue, recording 67 offensive snaps in the 38-7 win that ended the Giants season. Graham contributed one sack and four tackles to the Eagles successful and chirp-happy outing, while Lawrence concluded the game with six total tackles, four of them solo. Kelce and Graham will continue to the NFC Championship game on Sunday at 3 p.m. against the San Francisco 49ers, with a spot in the 2023 Super Bowl on the line.
