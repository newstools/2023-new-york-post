It was an a-flop-alyptic display. A Hong Kong man redefined “taking the show on the road” after pretending to be hit by a car in an over-the-top performance for the ages. A video of his World Cup-worthy injury appeal boasts nearly 155,000 views on Twitter as viewers ridicule the fraudster’s acting. The crash-for-cash gambit went down Jan. 1 in Mongkok after the unidentified huckster masqueraded as a car collision victim in an attempt to collect injury money, Asia Wire reported. These types of scammers are known as “porcelain” due to their penchant for breaking at the slightest touch. The eyebrow-raising POV footage, filmed from the driver’s dashcam, starts off with a driver turning the corner, whereupon she encounters the man running toward her at full speed. Upon spotting the fellow, the motorist slows her car to nearly a full stop. Nonetheless, the street performer jumps dramatically off the hood and then rolls off before staggering away in an exaggerated manner. But the faker’s theatrics are far from finished. The injury feigner proceeds to drop to the concrete and starts rolling around all over the road for a full minute in a manner that makes a soccer flopper look like an Oscar-winning actor. The scammer’s intersection breakdancing session is interrupted after paramedics arrive at the scene and make their way toward him. He flees upon seeing them, presumably to prevent them from discovering that he is faking a scene. The swindler’s performance was promptly ripped online with one viewer snarking, “Give him the oscar!” Others compared the man to Neymar, a Brazilian soccer player known for his theatrical flopping displays. In a far better performance last spring, an Arkansas man claimed he was injured during an arrest, only to jump out of his wheelchair and escape from police on the way to court. No feign no gain, we guess.
