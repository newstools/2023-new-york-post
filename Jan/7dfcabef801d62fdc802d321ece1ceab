WASHINGTON — Al-Amir Dawes scored 21 of his career-high 24 points after halftime and Seton Hall beat Georgetown 66-51 on Tuesday night to extend the Hoyas’ regular-season conference losing streak to 27 games. Dawes went on an 11-0 run with a layup and three 3s in a three-minute stretch to break a 32-all tie and the Pirates (9-8, 3-4 Big East) were never contested again. Akok Akok, Jordan Riley and Primo Spears each scored nine points for Georgetown (5-13, 0-7). Qudus Wahab grabbed 10 rebounds for Georgetown. The Hoyas haven’t won in conference since the Big East Tournament to end the 2020-21 season. Georgetown won four straight in the tournament to grab the conference title with a 13-12 record and lost its opening round NCAA Tournament game to Colorado. Georgetown is 11-38 overall since then. Seton Hall now has won four straight in a series that started in 1909. Seton Hall trails 61-55 even though Georgetown once won 17 straight against the Pirates.
