The former Marine Pen Farthing, who coordinated the evacuation of cats and dogs from Kabul in Aug. 2021, says he had to leave the city because of Prince Harry’s claim that the royal killed 25 Taliban soldiers during his two tours of combat. Pen Farthing slammed Harry’s autobiography, “Spare,” which was released prematurely in Spain last week, as “badly judged.” Farthing, 53, said Friday Harry’s revelations about the prince’s time in Afghanistan have put his own life in danger, the Sun reported. He left Kabul, leaving behind his work with animal shelters because of  the “potential reprisal attacks on ex-forces people like me.” Farthing tweeted after reading excerpts from the memoir: “Well I was a Royalist until today…Cheers #PrinceHarry. You have been very badly advised I would probably say. “And glad you thought through the security implications of those of us still out in #Afghanistan trying to bring about some good. #idiot #notmyprince.” His tweeted later: “I have had to evac from #Kabul tonight.” Farthing’s work with Operation Ark, which has been helping to rescue animals from shelters for the last 18 months, appears to now be paused. “The animals suffer not me,” he tweeted. During his two deployments in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot, Harry discussed the killings, claiming that he did not feel like the victims were real “people” but rather “chess pieces removed from the board.” Taliban leader Anas Haqqani wrote online: “Mr Harry! The ones you killed were not chess pieces, they were humans…these atrocities will be remembered in the history of humanity.” Haqqani said Harry’s claims are tantamount to “war crimes,” saying he should be tried under an “international court”.
