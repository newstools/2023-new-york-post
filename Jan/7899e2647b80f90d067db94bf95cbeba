Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with two forms of cancers, the tennis great said on Monday. Navratilova, 66, has throat and breast cancer, though both were discovered in the early stages. “This double whammy is serious but still fixable, and I’m hoping for a favorable outcome,” Navratilova said in a statement. “It’s going to stink for a while, but I’ll fight with all have I got.” Navratilova previously had breast cancer in 2010, but was deemed cancer-free after a lumpectomy and six months of radiation. Navratilova was in for a throat exam when both forms of the disease were discovered. She will begin treatment later this month. The Czech-born Navratilova was one of the more dominant players in the 1970s and 80s, claiming 18 Grand Slam singles titles. She had a long-running rivalry with American Chris Evert, who recently battled ovarian cancer. “I really didn’t talk much about breast cancer before I had it,” Navratilova previously told People. “Now, I’m approached by women and we share our stories. It’s encouraging to see that there’s life after cancer.” She won 59 Grand Slam titles overall, including 31 in women’s doubles and 10 in mixed doubles. The last was a mixed doubles championship with Bob Bryan at the 2006 U.S. Open, a month shy of her 50th birthday. Navratilova originally retired in 1994, after a record 167 singles titles and 331 weeks at No. 1 in the WTA rankings. She returned to the tour to play doubles in 2000 and occasionally competed in singles, too. Navratilova was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000. She has worked as a TV analyst in recent years. The statement issued Monday said Navratilova would not be a regular part of Tennis Channel’s coverage of the Australian Open later this month “but hopes to be able to join in from time to time” via video conference. — With AP
