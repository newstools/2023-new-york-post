Just days after he announced he’d return to the University of Michigan for his senior season, star running back Blake Corum had his car stolen. According to the Associated Press, Corum’s camouflaged 2017 Camaro — with his “BC2” moniker printed on the driver’s side — was driven off from a parking garage near his residence between Jan. 13 to Jan. 16. The star said his flashy ride was a high school graduation gift from his parents. “Wasn’t NIL funded, my parents used their hard earned money to bless me with something nice after I graduated high school,” Corum posted to Twitter. “God bless whoever stole it.” Corum’s reply was in response to a tweet, where he refuted claims the now-stolen car was acquired through his NIL (name, image, and likeness) deal money. According to The Wolverine, the driver also made off with Corum’s All-America helmet and various clothing items. He ran for 1,463 yards and 18 touchdowns, though his season ended prematurely after suffering a knee injury against Illinois on Nov. 19. Corum announced his intention to return to Michigan for his senior year following the Wolverine’s 51-45 loss to TCU in the Fiesta Bowl. “My goals have always been about leaving an enduring legacy at the winningest program in the history of college football.” “Motivated by my profound love for Michigan and my commitment to my education, I have decided to return for another season. It is an honor to be a student-athlete at the University of Michigan!”
