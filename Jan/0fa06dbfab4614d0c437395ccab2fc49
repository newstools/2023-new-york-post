Elon Musk taunted incendiary influencer and alleged sex trafficker Andrew Tate Saturday — after the billionaire Tesla founder praised Greta Thunberg. “Sometimes it’s just better to make pizza at home,” the Twitter boss tweeted on New Year’s Eve. The dig referenced the theory that Tate, 36, was discovered hiding out in Romania after he posted a video holding a pizza box from Jerry’s Pizza, a chain popular in the country. Tate had attempted to use the box as a prop to clap back at the 19-year-old eco-warrior, whom he had engaged in a viral Twitter spat with just one day earlier. The self-proclaimed misogynist told an off-screen person in the clip to make sure they didn’t recycle the boxes as he told Thunberg she was a “slave of the matrix.” Tate was arrested Thursday shortly after the video was posted on kidnapping and rape charges. He and his brother had allegedly formed an organized crime group and “sexually exploited” women and forced them to make pornographic films. Musk’s New Year’s Eve tweet was the third dunk on Tate since his foreign arrest. On Friday, Musk, 51, tweeted that Thunberg was “cool” for taking on the internet provocateur. “The sheer amount of brand awareness achieved by Greta within a few years is astounding. I think she’s cool tbh,” Musk said of the Swedish activist in response to a post by satirical site Babylon Bee’s Thunberg-themed thermostat, which “scowls at you when you turn the heat up.” Musk is the founder of Tesla, an electric carmaker. Musk also tweeted an image from “The Matrix” movie referencing Tate’s doomed video: “What if I told you the only way to escape the Matrix is to unlearn everything that you have been taught and rebuild your entire belief system based on critical thought & analysis.” Musk shot down rumors that he and Tate were friends Friday, claiming that the two have never met. Musk also said he had never been to a Halloween party in Romania.
