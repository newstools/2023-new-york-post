Little has united the nation in recent years as did the shock, horror and prayers for Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin after he suffered an onfield  cardiac arrest midway through the first quarter of Monday night’s game with the Cincinnati Bengals. It was absolutely terrifying: After taking a hard  hit to the chest while tackling the Bengals’ Tee Higgins, the 24-year-old rose, took a few steps —then collapsed. Medical staff raced to his aid quickly, administered CPR to restart his heart and rushed him to the hospital, where he remains sedated in critical condition. The packed stadium fell into a nervous hush almost instantly after his collapse, eventually breaking as the Cincinnati crowd applauded in support of the downed visitor. Players — men known for strength and competitiveness — broke into tears. Folks from all over expressed well-wishes. Within hours, a toy drive for kids that Hamlin had hoped would raise $2,500 had collected more than $4 million. It all speaks volumes about the hearts of Americans: “Last night was supposed to be a great night for the NFL,” said Bengals President Mike Brown. Instead, “humanity and love rose to the forefront.” Hopes remain high for Hamlin: “We’re confident that no matter what he’s facing, he is going to come out on top,” his marketing rep and friend Jordon Rooney insists. Americans should keep praying Rooney is right.
