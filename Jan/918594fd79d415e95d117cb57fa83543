If you have a jar that’s been sitting in the back of your pantry because you can’t get the lid off, you’re in luck. People on social media have discovered a hack to easily pop that lid off — and all it takes is a spoon. TikToker Dustin Hadley — also known as That40yearguy to his 655,600 followers — decided to try the hack for himself. “You’re telling me for 40 years I’m having to get my wife every time I needed to open a jar, I could’ve been doing this?” he said. “Ain’t no way.” All you need to do is place a spoon underneath the lid vertically, then push it up and the lid will just pop off. When the lid popped off, Hadley started laughing in disbelief. “Never ask for help again with those pesky lids,” he captioned the video, which now has 2.4 million views and 86,800 likes. The viral video left users shocked. “I just tried it worked perfect. thanks,” one person commented. “bro WHAT?! Where has this been, I live alone!! Thnx!” another said. “don’t show my girl this I still want to be useful lol,” a user joked. “I used knife all the time, but now I think spoon is more practical idea,” someone shared. Some claimed they already knew of the hack. “Been doing it for years. Release the pressure open it up,” one person said. “I actually do that on a regular basis lol,” another commented. “It is a lever effect to release the vacuum seal,” someone pointed out. “I’ve learned that old trick from my grandma,” one user shared.
