PHILADELPHIA – Brock Purdy’s Cinderella story just took a crazy twist. Purdy injured his elbow when he was sacked and fumbled on the final play of the 49ers’ first offensive drive, which prompted veteran Josh Johnson to come off the bench with his team in a 7-0 hole in the first quarter of the NFC Championship game against the Eagles. Johnson is the 49ers’ fourth-string quarterback, added during the season after the season-ending injury to starter Trey Lance, the long-term injury to Jimmy Garoppolo. Johnson, 36, entered the NFL as a fifth-round draft pick and has been a member of 14 different NFL organizations (including three stints with the 49ers) and teams in the now-defunct Alliance of American Football and the XFL. He was making his playoff debut. Purdy was 7-0 as a starter including the playoffs and that was his first lost fumble, caused by Haason Reddick. He eventually returned to the game after Johnson suffered a concussion. The 49ers lost the game 31-7.
