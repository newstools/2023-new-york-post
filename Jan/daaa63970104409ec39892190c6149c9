An apparently homeless man set a bunch of discarded Christmas trees ablaze on a Manhattan street early Tuesday, police said, with the flames spreading to a nearby dining shed and damaging a number of cars. Daniel Ventre, 39, was arrested shortly after he allegedly set the four trees, which had been left out for the trash, on fire on West 15th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues around 5:50 a.m., authorities said. Photos show an outdoor dining area completely engulfed in flames.Â Three cars also sustained fire damage, cops said. Ventre was pictured following his arrest, wearing a Jets winter hat and a green coat over a black Led Zeppelin shirt. He was charged with arson, four counts of criminal mischief and one count of reckless endangerment, police said. The personal address Ventre provided to police, on Ninth Avenue near West 28th Street, is the location of the Church of the Holy Apostles, which runs a soup kitchen for the homeless.
