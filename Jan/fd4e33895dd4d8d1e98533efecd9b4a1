Australian influencer Mikaela Testa has stunned her followers with a full-frontal nude selfie that some suspect is a public swipe at her ex-boyfriend. The 22-year-old shared the image — which showed her standing in a hallway, completely naked — to Twitter on Wednesday, and it quickly went viral. Testa’s followers — who, across Instagram and TikTok, amount to close to 3 million — were quick to share their reactions, joking the “revenge” photo had “once again … proven to me that I am so very gay.” “When I tell you @mikaelatesta’s new photo made me know I’m bi, I’m telling the truth,” another wrote, in an Instagram Story that the OnlyFans creator then shared to her own profile. “I used to say I’m bi, but now after I saw @mikaelatesta I’m definitely lesbian for sure,” said another. Others’ reactions referenced Testa’s ex, fellow influencer Atis Paul, whom she split from last June. “RIP to her ex,” said one, while a second wrote: “@mikaelatesta’s ex crying in the club right now after seeing her Twitter.” “F**k @mikaelatesta why you gotta do that to us? Being your ex would suck,” commented a third. A fourth said: “Imagine being @mikaelatesta’s ex right now.” It comes after Testa sent her fans into a spin after confirming she was on Tinder. Responding to direct messages that she said flooded her inbox in December, asking to confirm whether the profile on the dating app really was hers, Testa wrote: “to all my dms rn, yes this is me.” Her profile listed her employment as a social media influencer and explained what she was looking for in a man. “I’m 5’3 but I only like 6ft+ guys,” she wrote, adding a specific length for a potential suitor’s genitalia as well. “I’m looking for a soulmate so left me if you’re not that. Also, have to be jobless so you can come and travel the world with me. I do OF so I can support us both.”
