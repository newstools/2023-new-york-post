No one seems to “out-pizza the Hut” for Eagles coach Nick Sirianni and his staff. The second-year headman told reporters that he had a yearning for Pizza Hut of all things while he and his offensive coaches watched the Giants’ win over the Vikings in the NFC wild-card round on Sunday. So Scott Kaniecki, Sirianni’s administrative assistant, made it happen for his boss, but the order wasn’t exactly a Philly Special. “I was kinda craving Pizza Hut stuffed-crust pizza,” Sirianni told reporters of how he watched the Giants as the Eagles enjoyed a bye as the NFC’s top seed. “I haven’t had that in a while. That’s not something I get to get at home. So we had that.” Philadelphia, which won both regular-season meetings with the Giants, will welcome their NFC East rival for a Divisional Round game on Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles handedly defeated the Giants, 48-22, in December, but Big Blue – playing mostly backups – fell just 22-16 in Week 18 against the majority of Philly’s regulars. While Sirianni and Co. were enjoying their slices, the got to see Giants quarterback Daniel Jones play one of the best games his career and returning corner Adoree’ Jackson shutdown all-world receiver Justin Jefferson. The Giants will hope to play just as well on Saturday to make it a great day for them and advance to the NFC Championship for the first time since 2011. It would leave Sirianni and the Eagles another opportunity to order up some Pizza Hut while they sit at home and watch Big Blue play.
