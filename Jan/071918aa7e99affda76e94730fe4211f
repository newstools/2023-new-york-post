It was Agatha all along. Kathryn Hahn teased Saturday that her “Wandavision” spinoff series might feature a few musical numbers, according to TVLine. Hahn, 49, will reprise her iconic role as the sorceress Agatha Harkness in Marvel’s upcoming “Agatha: Coven of Chaos.” “Um, her costumes and her nails. They’re fabulous,” gushed Hahn. “And who knows, there may be a little song here or there … but no one is saying anything about that — certainly not me!” Hahn was first introduced into the Marvel universe as Agnes — Wanda Maximoff’s nosey neighbor in 2021 series ” Wandavision” — and has since become a fan favorite. The song “Agatha All Along” — which was written by “Frozen” composers Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez and sung by Hahn —  levitated its way to number 36 on the Billboard chart and placed fifth on the iTunes “Top 100 singles chart” after its debut in 2021. The song also won an Emmy for “Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.” “I knew I was going to have a theme song, but I actually didn’t know I was going to be singing it until we were midway through shooting it and they were like, ‘Oh, we’re going to need you to sing,’” said Hahn to Nylon. “I was like, ‘Great,’ but I had zero expectations that it was going to be the thing that would pop out. I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ It was really like it was [happening on] a different planet — it was like another us or another me, just this other thing that was happening. Someone was like, ‘You topped the Biebs!’ And I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ The whole thing was so very, very surreal.” “Agatha: Coven of Chaos” will also feature Broadway legend Patti LuPone and “White Lotus” alum Aubrey Plaza. The Marvel show is set to cast its spell on Disney Plus in late 2023 and is sure to be a gas.
