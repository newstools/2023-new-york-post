There’s a mega fiesta going down at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena on Jan. 21-22. Over the course of two days, many of the biggest names in Latin music like Karol G, Myke Towers, Farukko, Becky G and Jhay Cortez will land at the Lakers and Clippers home to entertain audiences that have traveled far and wide for the festival event of the season. Arcangel and Ivy Queen are also set to perform at the highly anticipated weekend extravaganza. And, at first glance, it appears that ticket prices are pretty high for two-day passes to the stacked event. On Vivid Seats, we found that two-day passes start at $303 before fees. However, if you opt for a different strategy and buy two single-day passes for $76 and $124 before fees respectively, you can save quite a bit of coin. You better hurry though — these prices were found at the time of publication and are subject to fluctuation. Other artists set to appear scheduled to play at Calibash include Chencho Corleone, Jhayco, Nio Garcia, Zion & Lennox, Sech, Feid and Blessd.  A number of the biggest names in reggaeton, urbano, bachata and hip hop might be hitting your city before you know it this year. Here are just five of our favorite Latin stars you’ll want to keep an eye on the next few months when they tour. • Rauw Alejandro • Anuel AA • Marc Anthony • Los Temerarios •  Mana And make sure you don’t miss Calibash when it drops into Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena on March 31. Tickets start at $86 before fees on Vivid Seats.
