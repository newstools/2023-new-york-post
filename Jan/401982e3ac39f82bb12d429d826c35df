A small single-engine plane crashed in the northern suburbs of New York City Thursday — killing both people on board, officials said. The Beechcraft A36, on its way to Cuyahoga County Airport in Ohio from JFK Airport, went down around 6:15 p.m. after the pilot reported engine trouble about one mile from Westchester County Airport in White Plains, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The plane was found hours later in the trees near Rye Lake, according to Westchester County officials. Both passengers were found dead inside the wreckage. Their identities have not yet been released. But the owner of the plane, a business owner from Ohio, told CBS2 that the two people aboard were experienced pilots from the Cleveland area. The plane’s owner also told the news outlet he was devastated by the crash. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident. Westchester’s airport is roughly a 40-mile drive to JFK Airport.
