A brand-new single from XXXTentacion — who was killed in June 2018 — dropped Monday on what would have been the rapper’s 25th birthday. The single, titled “I’m Not Human,” also features rapper Lil Uzi Vert. “A gift from Jah…Thank you #liluzi 1.23.23,” reads the caption of XXXTentacion’s memorial Instagram account, alongside cover art for the posthumous single. The song is a heavy, balladesque melody — which is a massive change from the rapper’s usual fast-paced tempo — brought down to earth by the rapper’s uncharacteristically introspective lyrics. XXXTentacion’s estate also posted a heartfelt message to his Instagram Stories, followed by archival images of the late rapper at various concerts and as a baby. “Happy birthday Jah. Another year without you here physically,” they wrote. “However, you will always live in our hearts and memories. Your amazing fans have continued to support you and keep your legacy thriving. “We are eternally grateful for them and the times we’ve shared,” continued the post. “Here’s to continuing to have you touch millions of hearts around the world LLJ.” XXXTentacion was ambushed and gunned down in June 2018 while leaving a motorcycle dealership with a friend in Deerfield Beach, Florida. An SUV blocked his car’s path and a pair of assailants hopped out, taking aim at the rapper. According to the dealership’s surveillance video, the two men tried to rob the rapper and later shot him in the neck before fleeing the scene. Police later picked up Michael Boatwright, 28, and his alleged accomplices, Dedrick Williams, 26, and Trayvon Newsome, 24, in connection to the murder. It was reported this month that jury selection for the trial has begun. All three men face life in prison if convicted. An alleged fourth suspect was later arrested by police and pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a deadly weapon.
