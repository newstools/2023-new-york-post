When Giants quarterback Davis Webb takes the field on Sunday in his first career start, expect his longtime girlfriend to be cheering him on nearby. On Saturday, the same day The Post’s Ryan Dunleavy reported that Webb was expected to start over backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor in the Giants’ regular-season finale against the Eagles in Philadelphia, Donnett Hickson offered her support to the 27-year-old signal-caller, who was recently elevated from the practice squad. “Go Big Blue,” Hickson posted in an Instagram Story that featured her wearing a light blue jacket and matching mini skirt, as well as dark blue boots. Webb is in his second stint with the Giants after spending the past three seasons in Buffalo with Brian Daboll, who previously served as the Bills’ offensive coordinator. Webb signed with the Giants in February 2022, a month after Daboll was named the team’s head coach. The Giants, who clinched a playoff berth last week, are expected to rest key starters against the Eagles, including quarterback Daniel Jones, as they’ve got nothing to gain as the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoff race. As for Hickson, she has been part of Webb’s NFL journey for some time. Dating since at least 2021, Hickson previously praised the Giants on Instagram in September, when the team got off to a “2 and whoa” start. The Giants kick off against the Eagles at 4:25 p.m. on Sunday.
