Maria Sakkari wasn’t happy with her opponent’s mid-match celebrations at the Australian Open on Tuesday. Sakkari, of Greece, paused her second-round match with Russia’s Diana Shnaider to complain about the 18-year-old “screaming” when she scored a point in the second set. “If she screams one more time in my face,” the 27-year-old Sakkari said while wagging her finger at the umpire. “No, no, no, no, one more time… she’s coming toward me. One more time and I’m going to speak to the referee.” Sakkari, who entered tournament as the No. 6 seed, went on to win the match, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in two and a half hours in a hard-fought performance by Shnaider. In her post-match interview, Sakkari praised Shnaider, who was making her Grand Slam debut at the event. “It was a very high level from both of us. She played an amazing match,” Sakkari said. “She’s very young, she’s very promising. Maybe she should consider not going to college and turning pro.” Sakkari explained how Shnaider challenged her during the match and complimented her opponent’s aggressive performance. “It’s never easy to play someone you have never played before, never seen before on the tour. I was a little bit hesitant,” Sakkari said. “She was swinging very hard, she was playing very aggressive. I know I should have been more aggressive because I was very far back from the baseline, running and defending every single ball, which is not my game. But still I tried to find ways. I think I am good at trying to find solutions.” Shnaider, who committed to play college tennis at N.C. State in August, dazzled in the Australian Open qualifying, defeating 2021 junior US Open winner Robin Montgemery. Prior to her training at N.C. State, Shnaider won the 2022 US Open junior doubles championship. Sakkari will face China’s Zhu Lin in the third round of the 2023 Australian Open on Friday.
