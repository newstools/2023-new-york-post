A teenage girl fatally threw herself off the top of a luxury apartment building on the Upper East Side on Sunday afternoon, cops said. The 17-year-old girl jumped from the eighth floor of 122 E. 82nd St. around 12:54 p.m., cops said. She was pronounced dead a short time later. The girl’s identity wasn’t immediately released. Co-ops in the Manhattan building have sold for as much as about $5 million recently, according to StreetEasy.com. The real estate Web site says the prewar building is nine stories tall. “I was coming out of my apartment and there were three ambulances on the block,” one neighbor told The Post. “It’s horrible. It’s absolutely horrendous.” A doorman who works on the block said it was the second time in about six months that someone jumped to their death in the area. “It’s just crazy,” the doorman said. A 27-year-old man leaped to his death on June 19 from 131 East 82nd Street, an apartment building across the street, according to the East Side Feed blog. In September 2019, a 65-year-old woman fell or jumped from a building at East End Avenue and East 82nd Street and survived.
