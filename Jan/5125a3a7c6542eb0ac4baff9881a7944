A new combination penthouse at Brooklyn Heights’ Quay Tower — where the actress Zendaya keeps an investment unit — has hit the market for $17.9 million. That price reflects the developer’s costs to adjoin the two separate dwellings. The 30-story tower is also home to the borough’s most expensive condo sale: a $20.3 million combo penthouse that went into contract in 2018 and closed virtually in 2020 during lockdown. (The former record was Matt Damon’s $16.7 million penthouse purchase at the Standish, also in Brooklyn Heights.) Zendaya, the Emmy Award-winning star of the hit series “Euphoria” and films like “The Greatest Showman” and “Spider-Man,” bought her $4.9 million unit in the building in 2020, as Gimme Shelter exclusively reported. She has since shared time with boyfriend and “Spider-Man” co-star Tom Holland at his Upper West Side rental and in LA, where she owns a $4 million ranch house in Encino. The sky palace now on the market, at 50 Bridge Park Drive, is 6,100 square feet when combined. The unit features five bedrooms, three residence entries, and prime water and city skyline views. A private high-speed elevator opens to an entry foyer leading to an eat-in chef’s kitchen with pocket doors. There’s also a mudroom with custom cabinets, a laundry room, multi-zone heating and cooling, radiant heated floors and UV-insulated floor-to-ceiling windows. The building was completed in 2019. Amenities include a roof deck lounge with cabanas, barbecues and fireplaces — as well as a gym, a music room with a baby grand piano, a concierge and a pet wash. The listing brokers are Jim Hayes, Brad Mohr, Jamie Hannon and Kelly Klingman of Serhant.
