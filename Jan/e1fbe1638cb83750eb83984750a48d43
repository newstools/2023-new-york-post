Maurice Jones-Drew may have a second career as a psychic. The former Jaguars running back predicted Saturday’s stunning comeback at halftime on NFL Network. With the Jaguars trailing the Chargers by 20 points at halftime of the AFC wild card game, Jones-Drew called his shot. “The most Charger thing to do is to allow the Jaguars back in the game in the second half and they win on a last-second field goal,” he said. And Jacksonville did just that, rallying for a 31-30 victory on Riley Patterson’s 36-yard field goal as time expired. It capped the third-biggest postseason comeback in the sport’s history, as quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw four touchdown passes after throwing four interceptions in the first half. “You couldn’t write a crazier script,” Lawrence told reporters afterwards. “We said in the locker room that’s kind of how our season’s going. We’re never out of the fight. … I’m kind of speechless, honestly, just to see what belief can do and to see when a team believes in each other what you can accomplish.” The 37-year-old Jones-Drew spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Jaguars before finishing up with the Raiders, rushing for 8,167 yards and 68 touchdowns. He never was part of a playoff game quite like this one. Of course, few players have been.
