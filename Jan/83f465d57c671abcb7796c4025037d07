The Jets have found their new offensive coordinator – and that is going to lead to speculation about who their new quarterback will be. The Jets hired Nathaniel Hackett to run their offense, and he has one connection that is going to drive plenty of speculation. Hackett was the Packers offensive coordinator from 2019-21 and worked closely with quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who may hit the trade block this offseason. If the Jets do pursue Rodgers, Hackett could be part of attracting him to Gang Green. Hackett is coming off of a disastrous 15-game stint as the Broncos head coach. He was fired after a 51-14 loss to the Rams on Christmas that dropped Denver’s record to 4-11. Hackett, 43, has history with Jets coach Robert Saleh. The two worked together with the Jaguars in 2015-16 when Saleh coached linebackers and Hackett was the quarterbacks coach. Hackett became the offensive coordinator in Jacksonville under Doug Marrone from 2016-18, helping the Jaguars go to the AFC Championship Game with Blake Bortles at quarterback. The Jaguars were sixth in total offense that season. Hackett then went on to be the offensive coordinator with the Packers from 2019-21 under Matt LaFleur, who is one of Saleh’s best friends. Hackett was not the play-caller in Green Bay but worked closely with Rodgers. The Packers had top 10 offenses in his final two seasons there, and were No. 1 in scoring offense in 2020. Hackett’s father, Paul, was the Jets offensive coordinator under Herm Edwards from 2001-04. The Jets let go of Mike LaFleur at the end of the season after two years on the job.
