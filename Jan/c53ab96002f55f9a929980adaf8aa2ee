Kate Upton and Justin Verlander got dressed to the nine’s on Saturday night. The occasion was the annual Baseball Writers’ Association of America New York chapter dinner at the New York Hilton Midtown, where Verlander received his third Cy Young award. Verlander won the award for his 2022 season with the Astros, in which went 18-4 with a 1.75 ERA. He signed a two-year deal worth $86 million with the Mets this offseason. Verlander was presented the award by Buck Showalter, who will be managing him with the Mets. Upton posted a photo of the couple on Instagram, captioning that they were “all dressed up.” “Thank you, Buck, for the kind words,” Verlander said. “I’ve had the pleasure of playing for some great, Hall of Fame managers in my career and I really look forward to having the opportunity to play for — in my opinion — another one, so thank you. I’m very excited to start this next chapter of my career with the Mets as well. Thank you to Steven and Alex Cohen for bringing me here to New York.” Verlander, a sure-fire future Hall of Famer, is entering his 18th MLB season. At his introductory press conference with the Mets, he oozed confidence that he still has a lot of fuel left in the tank. “Why put in all that time and effort and work and sacrifice and sell myself short at the end?” Verlander said in December. “It’s like running a marathon and stopping a mile from the finish line. Maybe I’m 10 miles from the finish line. I don’t know. What, would you do that? That’s my mindset. I feel great. My body feels great. I feel the game will naturally tell me when it’s time to step aside and I feel like I’m nowhere near that point yet.” Earlier this month, The Post reported that the 39-year-old Verlander and 30-year-old Upton bought an Upper East Side penthouse, whose most recent asking price was $16.75 million. Upton is a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover model. She and Verlander have been married since 2017.
