Dionne Warwick had more than a little prayer to say for Snoop Dogg. In the new CNN film “Dionne Warwick: Don’t Make Me Over,” Warwick shared that she once invited Snoop along with some other prominent rappers in the 1990s for an intervention. The 82-year-old singer said she had enough of the misogynistic lyrics in the songs topping the charts and invited them to meet at her home at 7 a.m. sharp — which intimidated Snoop and his friends so much that they arrived at 6:52 a.m. “We were kind of, like, scared and shook up,” Snoop admitted. “We’re powerful right now, but she’s been powerful forever. Thirty-some years in the game, in the big home with a lot of money and success.” When they showed up on the “Heartbreaker” singer’s driveway, she insisted that they call her a “bitch” to her face — since that’s what they all called women in their lyrics. “She was checking me at a time when I thought we couldn’t be checked,” Snoop revealed. “We were the most gangsta as you could be, but that day at Dionne Warwick’s house, I believe we got out-gangstered that day. “They all showed up and, yeah, it did work,” Warwick remembered. “I think what it was was that they needed to hear me.” Warwick said she told the group of rappers: “You guys are all going to grow up. You’re going to have families. You’re going to have children. You’re going to have little girls and one day that little girl is going to look at you and say, ‘Daddy, did you really say that? Is that really you?’ What are you going to say?” The tactic actually worked, and Snoop left the intervention inspired to change the way he approached his music. “I made it a point to put records of joy – me uplifting everybody and nobody dying and everybody living,” Snoop said of his change, which started with his 1996 album “Tha Doggfather.” “Dionne, I hope I became the jewel that you saw when I was the little, dirty rock that was in your house,” Snoop added. “I hope I’m making you proud.”
