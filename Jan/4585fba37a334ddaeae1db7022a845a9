Here’s one job to sink your teeth into. Banking giant JPMorgan Chase is seeking to lure a food editor by offering a “$30,000 annual restaurant budget” in an effort to drive clients to its credit card business. The New York-based role for its restaurant review service, The Infatuation, is described on the company’s website as “an editing job and also very much an eating job – you’ll get a $30,000 annual restaurant budget for dining out. If that sounds amazing rather than intimidating to you, we should talk!” The candidate — who will receive a starting salary ranging from $85,000 to $130,000 — must have a minimum five years’ experience and be the kind of editor who will “lose sleep over a missing comma or a misspelled menu item.” America’s largest bank is also hiring in the UK for someone to “spend your nights checking out as many restaurants as possible, and your days writing about them.” JPMorgan acquired buzzy food reviewer The Infatuation — which also owns restaurant rating website Zagat — as a way of offering more rewards for its credit card customers. Credit card companies are increasingly offering perks like reservations at restaurants and exclusive access to trendy restaurants as a way to attract business. In 2019, American Express purchased reservation website Resy as a way of giving its customers a leg-up when it comes to getting coveted restaurant reservations. “The Infatuation, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in 2021 to further the firm’s investment in and commitment to dining, has a mission to bring readers the most honest and trustworthy opinions on where to eat around the world,” a spokesperson for The Infatuation told The Post. “To accomplish this, The Infatuation’s team of writers dine anonymously and pay for their meals, and our company ensures that they have an operating budget to visit restaurants and provide readers with the very best dining intel in the cities we serve.”
