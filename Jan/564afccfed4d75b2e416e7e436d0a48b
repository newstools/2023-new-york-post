If you were hoping to find a little bit of Montana in the northeast, look no further than this 60-acre ranch in the Hamptons. And if you’re a fan of the buzzy “Yellowstone” series, take particular note. Located in Water Mill, a four-bedroom, eight-bathroom home that looks straight out of the series is up for rent, asking a cool $30,000 per month. Described as a “plush ranch unparalleled with western authenticity and rustic elegance,” the log home comes complete with horse paddocks, riding trails and unspoiled nature. Features include two horse stalls and a professional grand prix riding arena. There’s also a heated pool, a movie theater, a gym/playroom and a three-car garage. The rental also comes with a full-time caretaker. “Yellowstone” is a critically acclaimed and popular series that follows the Dutton family, owners of the largest ranch in Montana, as they face tribulations. On Tuesday, Kevin Costner, who plays John Dutton (the owner of the ranch), won a Golden Globe for his performance. If you want to live out those screen dreams at another time of year, this property asks $325,000 during the summer months — from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Or it’s $99,000 for June, $125,000 for the month of July and $149,000 for August. The property was once featured in the Architectural Digest’s “Country” issue cover. “The home offers magnificent one of a kind designer furniture,” the listing adds. “Having the best of both worlds, this is a once in a lifetime experience.” Erica Grossman and Maria Mendelsohn of Douglas Elliman hold the listing.
