A pair of New York football fans have spiked a $6 billion lawsuit against the Jets, Giants, and NFL after fumbling their pie-in-the-sky drive to have “New York” removed from the team’s names. Lawyers for plaintiffs Abdiell Suero and Maggie Wilkins and the defendants filed legal papers last week agreeing to the voluntary dismissal in Manhattan Federal Court. Suero and Wilkins’ class-action suit claimed they did not realize the teams played in New Jersey because the teams “fraudulently” use NY in their names. The dismissal came after federal Magistrate Judge Barbara Ross delivered a scorching Dec. 16 opinion. “A reasonable consumer would necessarily realize – before stepping on the train at Penn Station or driving through the Lincoln Tunnel – that he was, in fact, heading to New Jersey. Therefore, [the teams] could not have ‘caused’ plaintiffs to attend a football game at MetLife Stadium,” Ross wrote. The suit, filed last January, initially demanded both teams pack their pads and leave the Garden State for the Big Apple, but was amended in April to a slightly manageable request: the teams can stay in New Jersey but must dump “New York” from their names.
