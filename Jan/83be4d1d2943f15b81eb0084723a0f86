A 5-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after getting rammed into by a drunk driver — which sent her flying through the window of a driving school in Brazil. CCTV footage of the heart-stopping incident is currently blowing up online. The freak accident occurred on Saturday afternoon after the allegedly intoxicated motorist lost control while driving through Bonito in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Jam Press reported. In the dramatic footage, the suspect’s car is seen swerving crazily, before hitting a motorcyclist and a parked motorbike in front of the driving school. The vehicle then proceeds to plow into a potted plant bordered by a bench where the child and a man are sitting. And while the man manages to jump out of the way, the child is sent flying through the window along with the concrete shrubbery stand. Despite the horrific impact, the tyke manages to scramble to her feet and run to the man, who is presumed to be her guardian. Miraculously, she emerged from the crash largely unscathed, aside from a few cuts from the glass, according to an examination by the fire department shortly after they arrived on the scene. The rammed motorcyclist was transported to the hospital with bruises on his leg, Jam Press reported. Emergency services also administered the drunk-driving suspect a breathalyzer test, which allegedly revealed that he had a blood alcohol level of 0.95 mg/l, prompting police officers to place him under arrest. Authorities claimed that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel during the time of the crash. In an official statement following his arrest, the suspect admitted that he had been drinking since 10 a.m. that day but couldn’t recall anything about his alleged swath of destruction. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. This isn’t the first time a child has been struck by a vehicle and lived to tell the tale. Last October, a child miraculously survived after he was run over by a combine harvester in China.
