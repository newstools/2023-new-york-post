Odell Beckham Jr. didn’t go quietly when he was kicked off a flight in November. Bodycam video of the incident — captured by Miami-Dade Police — was released this week, showing the moments leading up to his removal from the flight. The American Airlines crew on the Los Angeles-bound plane said Beckham, 30, “appeared to be in and out of consciousness” as they attempted to wake him and have him fasten his seatbelt. The flight crew was “concerned” for his safety, called police and asked for his removal. Beckham was groggy and not happy with the situation. “I’ve never had this happen to me,” Beckham told officers. “We’re going to have to deplane everybody on this plane, and then you’re still going to get off,” the officer told him. “That’s fine,” the ex-Giant responded. Things took a turn as one passenger told the 2022 Super Bowl champion with the Rams to get off the plane. “You’re everything wrong with the world,” Beckham, currently a free agent, said. “Looking at me to get off a plane, for you. I would never, ever in my life get off the plane for you. Specifically you. Maybe everybody else, I would get off the plane.” Beckham continued, “You gon’ wait 40 minutes and I’m going to be on a private plane home. Yeah, with your fat ass. Get your ass off the plane for a second.” “Enjoy the cheese board on the way home with your ugly ass.” Beckham later took a private flight to LA, posting a video to Instagram and captioning it “Not today! Back to the regular.” The Pro Bowl wide receiver did continue with his cross-country free agency tour, visiting the Giants, Bills and Cowboys, though concerns over his surgically repaired knee reportedly kept teams from giving him a deal.
