The game of musical chairs for NFL quarterbacks this offseason could include Aaron Rodgers being traded. The longtime Packers quarterback, who appeared to be soaking up the scene at Lambeau Field earlier this month after the final game of his 18th season with the organization, could soon be on the move, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. “Both sides are fully aware that a trade is a very real scenario this offseason for Aaron Rodgers,” Schefter said Saturday on ESPN’s NFL Countdown. “The Packers are expected to move on from certain players, which Aaron Rodgers probably will not like. The issue here will be the $110 million left on his contract and which team could afford it. “But there is a real possibility that at some point this offseason, Aaron Rodgers is going to be traded.” The 39-year-old Rodgers, who has not yet decided whether he is ready to retire, indicated earlier this week that he knew a change of scenery could possibly be in his future. “If they want to go younger and think Jordan [Love] is ready to go, then that might be the way they want to go,” Rodgers said on the “Pat McAfee Show” Tuesday. “And if that’s the case and I still want to play, then there’s only one option, right, and that’s to play somewhere else. “If it’s not and they are like, ‘No, no, no, we still want you to play,’ and this and that, then it’d have to be the right situation with the roster that looks like we can win it all, because there’s no point in coming back if you don’t think you can win it all.” Rodgers is set to earn $59.5 million in 2023, which would come with a cap hit of $31.6 million. Along with Rodgers, Tom Brady is seen as likely to change teams if he does not retire while Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is also expected to be traded this offseason.
