A woman’s corpse was found between two parked cars in the Bronx early Monday — and investigators are eyeing her death as suspicious, cops said. The 55-year-old woman was discovered on the ground between a parked silver SUV and a red sedan on Sedgwick Avenue near the Roberto Clemente State Park Bridge in Morris Heights at 4:30 a.m., according to police and photos from the scene. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The circumstances were not immediately known, but authorities were probing whether foul play was a factor.
