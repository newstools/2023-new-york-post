Jim Harbaugh is flirting with the NFL once again. The Michigan coach, after claiming on Thursday he “expect[ed]” to stay in his current role in 2023, is set to interview with the Broncos early this week, NFL Network reported on Sunday. The Broncos are also expected to interview former Saints coach Sean Payton, among others, to replace Nathaniel Hackett, who was fired after one season at the helm. Harbaugh, 59, has been out of the NFL since 2014 after leading the 49ers to a 44-19-1 record across four seasons. Although his name has often been linked to NFL job openings since then, he has always ended up back at Michigan. After Harbaugh was linked to the Panthers’ opening last week, the coach released a statement through Michigan addressing the “rumors and speculation.” “As I stated in December, while no one knows what the future holds, I expect that I will be enthusiastically coaching Michigan in 2023,” Harbaugh wrote. “I have spoken with President Santa Ono and Athletic Director Warde Manuel and appreciate their support of me and our program. Our mission as Wolverines continues, and we are preparing for the 2023 season with great passion and enthusiasm. “As our legendary coach Bo Schembechler said … ‘Those who stay will be champions.’” Harbaugh and Michigan have been close to achieving that goal over the last two seasons, reaching the College Football Playoff in back-to-back years. But as the No. 2 seed both times, they have lost in the semifinals in both years, including getting upset by No. 3 TCU last weekend. Meanwhile, the NCAA is investigating Michigan for potential recruitment violations during the COVID-19 dead period, which could reportedly lead to a multi-game suspension for Harbaugh if he stays in Ann Arbor. Harbaugh interviewed with the Vikings last offseason before they eventually hired Kevin O’Connell.
