The internet is abuzz with rumors that Madonna might tour in 2023. While the Queen of Pop hasn’t had a proper nationwide trek since 2019’s “Madame X Tour,” fans have begun speculating online that the seven-time Grammy winner will announce a run of shows within the next week. “Jan. 17 announcement MAY be delayed, but it is still (for now) expected to be announced in January,” shared the Instagram account @encyclopediamadonnica. They added, “If delayed, not by much.” Our source also suggested that the tour will be “Hits-oriented and … ’80s-oriented in particular.” At the time of publication, we do not know the name of the tour, opening acts, venues or dates. Of course, we looked for clues on Madonna’s Instagram as well. We didn’t find much. Her most recent post, from Jan. 10, shows the 64-year-old riding horses with her 2015 song “Hold Tight” playing over the footage. Keep an eye out. You might be hearing “Material Girl,” “Like A Virgin” and “Holiday” live sooner than you expect.  While the “Where’s the beef” decade ended over 30 years ago, many of the biggest names from the heyday of MTV are still touring all over the world. Here are just five of our favorite acts from the ’80s who you can catch live in the next few months. • Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band • REO Speedwagon • Def Leppard and Motley Crue • Rick Springfield • Janet Jackson Want to see who else is out there?
