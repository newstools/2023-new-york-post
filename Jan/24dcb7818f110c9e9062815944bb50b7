An urban explorer took to the suburbs of Chicago where he discovered a creepy abandoned hunter’s mansion worth $750,000 — and with some unusual inclusions. “Today we are exploring the abandoned hunter’s mansion in Chicago’s suburbs … with a project car and stuffed bobcat left behind,” a man under the pseudonym Decaying Midwest wrote under the video’s caption. “I’m not sure what happened to this mansion or why everything was left to rot.” The property seems intact and in good shape on the exterior — but as the explorer makes his way inside, it paints a very different picture. The home, which has been vacant since 2018, shows a roof caved in in one of the rooms. Mold and dust have also captured the home, with trash also left throughout. A lot of furniture remains intact. But perhaps the most interesting item spotted in the home is a stuffed bobcat that seems to be falling apart and has been impacted by the elements. There is also a project car that was worked on before the home was left abandoned. One user commented they suspected the person was building a C1 Corvette. Newspapers dating back to 2018 indicate that was the year when the house was vacated. The basement’s fridge was still working, and the explorer noted how the freezer still produced ice. Meanwhile, the electricity was seen turning on inside one of the bathrooms and a motion sensor also appeared to still be working. Old VHS tapes of “Harry Potter,” “South Park,” and “Jurassic Park” are seen on the bookshelves. One room appears to either be a children’s room or a dancing space — as mirrors are lined from wall to wall. It still remains unclear as to who the owners are, or why it was left abandoned. The home’s exact location remains undisclosed.
