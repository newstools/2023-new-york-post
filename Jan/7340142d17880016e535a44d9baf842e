Jessie Lemonier, a former linebacker with the Detroit Lions, has died at the age of 25, the team announced Thursday. “We are shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of former Detroit Lion Jessie Lemonier,” the statement read. “Jessie was a model teammate and wonderful young man who is gone far too soon. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time.” Lemonier’s agent, Drew Smith of DEC Management, told ESPN on Thursday that the athlete was expecting a child with his girlfriend. Details regarding the cause of death have not yet been released. A Florida native, Lemonier began his NFL career as a member of the Los Angeles Chargers, whom he signed with in 2020 as an undrafted free agent out of Liberty. He joined the Lions a year later and appeared in seven games for Detroit. Lemonier briefly spent time with the Cardinals as well. Lemonier was previously selected by the Arlington Renegades of the XFL last fall but instead signed with the USFL’s Houston Gamblers. His playing rights were transferred to the Birmingham Stallions.
