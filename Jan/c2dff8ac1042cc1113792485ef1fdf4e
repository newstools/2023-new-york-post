Kevin Durant is “progressing well and as expected,” but the positive update from the Nets does not include a return date. Durant, two weeks after suffering an MCL sprain, will be re-evaluated in another two weeks, the Nets said Tuesday. Durant saw Dr. Riley Williams III at the Hospital for Special Surgery on Monday, and the team said the doctor is “very pleased” with Durant’s recovery. Durant will continue to strengthen his right knee and begin running and on-court basketball activities this week after going down in Miami on Jan. 8. The Nets have gone 2-4 without the superstar, winning two straight to calm some nerves about their ability to survive without him. Last year, the Nets plummeted once Durant hurt his knee, which he said helped lead to his offseason trade request.
