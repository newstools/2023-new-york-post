The Caesars Sportsbook promo code NPBONUSFULL unlocks a $1,250 first bet “on Caesars” for all new users. If you’re in Ohio, you can get the same offer but up to $1,500, with Caesars Sportsbook promo code NPBONUS1BET. New Caesars Sportsbook bettors elsewhere can get up to $1,250 back if their first bet loses when they register with the promo code NPBONUSFULL. This is one of the best offers around, as it is $250 more than you would typically find at other online sportsbooks. How does this offer work? Make your first bet at Caesars and if it loses, you’ll be refunded in bet credits, up to $1,250. So if you put $200 on this NFL teasers bet we detail below, you’ll profit about $166 if it wins. You’ll then have $366 in your account that’s real cash — this promo has effectively ended. If that first bet loses, you’ll bet $200 in bet credits back. You then must use the bet credits on any wager and turn them into cash. But you don’t keep the bet credit amount. So if you put $50 in credits on the Bengals -2.5 and it wins, you’ll profit about $45 but don’t keep the $50 in credits. The massive line movement in the AFC championship game has created an excellent value that bettors must capitalize on. You can now tease both underdog teams through the key numbers of three and seven. To do this, take the San Francisco 49ers at +2 or better and take the Kansas City Chiefs at +2 or better. The teaser will make them both 8 or 8.5-point underdogs, which is staggering value for games expected to be this tight. Be sure to lock this in at Caesars Sportsbook as their -120 odds on teasers are some of the best you will find. New and existing players. 21+. Available in AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, LA, MI, NJ, NY, TN, VA, WV only. Full T&C apply.. If you’re looking to pad your bankroll, look no further than Caesars Sportsbook.
