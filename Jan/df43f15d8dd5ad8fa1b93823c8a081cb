Great Scott! Michael J. Fox and his “Back to the Future” co-star Christopher Lloyd caused a blast from the past when they appeared at New York’s fabled Comic Con in October. The emotional duo chatted about their friendship and how it didn’t really take shape until the franchise’s third film, reports Variety. “Chris is a great guy. He’s very enigmatic,” said Fox. “It took me a few films to get to know him. On ‘Back to the Future Part III’ we connected in a way we hadn’t on the other films. I came to see how much he loved acting.” “I never got that before. To sit down and talk about acting and talk about Shakespeare and ‘King Lear’… This guy can play King Lear! People don’t expect that of him. He’s full of surprises,” continued the “Teen Wolf” star. “He can tell a movie’s worth of story in two seconds and you get it. Us regular actors have to lay out hours and hours to get the information out. Chris is brilliant at it. His love of film and his love of being an actor… He’s not just a crazy guy, he’s an artist.” The 61-year-old actor appeared at the Sundance Film Festival for the world premiere of his new documentary “Still” which covers Fox’s life with Parkinson’s disease — which he was diagnosed with in 1990. “I didn’t want to make a Parkinson’s movie. I don’t want to make a sick movie. I want to make a movie about a life,” said director Davis Guggenheim. “The one think he said to me was, ‘No violence.’ We hope the tone of the movie is no pitying. This is a movie about a wild life, an incredible ride of ups and downs and a Hollywood 1980s movie star and what happens when life throws him a curveball.” Fox joined the time-travel franchise in its later stages after actor Eric Stoltz — who originally portrayed McFly — was dismissed from the production because the director felt he was not right for the part. The franchise has raked in nearly $967 million dollars and is currently aiming to have a musical version on a Broadway stage in 2023.
