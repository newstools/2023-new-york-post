Damar Hamlin is back in Buffalo. A week after the Bills safety went into cardiac arrest during a game against the Bengals, the 24-year-old Hamlin was released from University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Monday and transferred to a hospital in Buffalo, doctors announced. “Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart,” Hamlin wrote on Twitter. “Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling. The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world n more. Bigger than football!” Hamlin, who was revived on the field, made gradual progress throughout the week and was cheering on the Bills from his hospital bed on Sunday, tweeting regularly throughout their win over the Patriots. “He’s up and walking around,” UC physician Dr. William Knight said Monday. Hamlin remained in the intensive care unit until his release on Monday. Bills cornerback Tre’Davious White revealed after Sunday’s game that Hamlin texted the team at 2:31 a.m. saying, “I’m thinking about y’all. I’m sorry that I did that to y’all.” “For him to check on us when he’s the person going through what he’s going through, that just shows what type of person he is for him to check on us in a situation like that, when he’s the one going through it,” White said
