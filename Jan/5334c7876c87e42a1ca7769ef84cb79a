A heartless stranger tossed scalding liquid at a homeless manâ€™s face in the vestibule of a bank just steps from the Port Authority Bus Terminal early Thursday, cops said. The 40-year-old victim was in the lobby the Chase Bank on Eighth Avenue near West 40th Street around 4 a.m. when another man walked up to him and threw an unknown liquid in his face without saying a word, police said. The victim was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center with burns to his face, cops said. His injuries are considered non-life-threatening. The suspect took off after the attack, and cops were still looking for him hours later.
