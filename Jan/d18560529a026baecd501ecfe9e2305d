Giants safety Jason Pinnock was carted off the field in the second half of Sundayâ€™s wild-card win over the Vikings after suffering an injury on a kickoff return at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minnesota. Pinnock, a second-year pro, appeared to take a hit to the midsection while making a tackle. He was sitting up while carted off the field. Head coach Brian Daboll and other defensive players were out there as Pinnock went on the cart. He was ruled out for the remainder of the game. Daboll told reporters after the game Pinnock went to local hospital with an abdomen injury. He has since been released and returned to the locker room, according to the Giants. Pinnock will fly back with the team and said he was feeling much better. Pinnock was originally drafted in the fifth round by the Jets in 2021. He was waived in August 2022 and was claimed off waivers by the Giants shortly after. The Giants knocked off the Vikings, 31-24, and will face the top-seeded Eagles next weekend in Philadelphia in the divisional round.
