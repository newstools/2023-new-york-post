This Karen’s behavior doesn’t fly in the skies. A woman who was kicked off a Spirit Airlines flight Sunday in Las Vegas went viral for being a so-called “Karen,” with many shocked she screamed that she hoped the flight would crash and everyone would die. The TikTok — which was posted by user @yutaka021 and has since gained nearly 3 million views — shows a man and woman being escorted out of the plane as several passengers boo them. As of Tuesday, it is unclear as to why the duo was booted from the plane, though The Post has reached out to Spirit Airlines for comment. “Boo you b–ch. If you were in my position you’d do the same thing,” screamed the woman responding to jeers from the crowd. “I hope y’all crash and die!” The remaining passengers collectively gasped at her remarks in the video, which also shows the flight’s pilot exiting the aircraft. It is unknown if he was speaking to the irate woman or calling the police. Verbal harassment is considered a Level 1 threat, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which violates federal law. The video made waves on TikTok, with many saying she was rightfully kicked off. “Miss ma’am bouta be on the FBI no fly list,” said one user. “That’s not something you wish for on Spirit,” commented another. Other people managed to make light of the incident. “NOT THE PILOT GOIN AFTER HER AND EVERYONE OOOING LIKE KIDS,” laughed one user. “Y’all on Spirit. It’s already a possibility,” chimed in a third.
