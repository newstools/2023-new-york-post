The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain, but the antiques in this historic home are seeking to scatter to the winds. The Stamford, Connecticut abode where “My Fair Lady” was penned will soon hit the market for roughly $2 million — and ahead of it listing for sale, it’s the site of a multi-day curio fair. “The estate sale is being held at a historic home, designed by architect Frazier Peters, where in the summer of 1955 Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe wrote the musical ‘My Fair Lady’ while renting the property,” interior designer and antique dealer Francis Merante told The Post of the event, which began this Friday and will continue until this Sunday, Jan. 29. (Specific hours and further details are available on an online listing for the event.) Lerner and Loewe’s stage musical was inspired by the 1913 play “Pygmalion” by George Bernard Shaw, and — following its success on Broadway — was made into the same-name 1964 film adaptation starring Audrey Hepburn as the poor flower vendor Eliza Doolittle. According to Merante, “The set design of the original production is actually based on the floor plan of the house.” The stone house is set to list after the weekend, the first time it will be on the market in nearly half a century as its current resident, a woman named Jakki Peters, has owned it for nearly 40 years. “She has filled it with antiques and decorative objects she collected while traveling the world and shopping local antique stores in New York and Connecticut,” said Merante. “The sale includes many unique antique items including Chinese furniture, Victorian-era furniture and unique garden items from around the estate.” The main house — as well as its remaining contents, a carriage house apartment, a two-car garage on the property and a 2008 Mini Cooper S — will list with Andrew Smith of Houlihan Lawrence once it formally hits the market.
