What happens in Vegas goes up on the ‘gram. Olivia Culpo rang in 2023 on Saturday night in Sin City, where she celebrated with Claire Kittle and Kristin Juszczyk, the wives of 49ers stars George Kittle and Kyle Juszczyk, respectively. Culpo — whose longtime boyfriend, running back Christian McCaffrey, was traded to San Francisco from the Carolina Panthers in October 2022 — enjoyed part of the night at Drais Nightclub with Claire, who posted a snap Sunday on her Instagram Stories. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum, 30, also tagged Kristin in a separate post. Culpo, a former Miss Universe, revealed earlier in the day Saturday how the New Year’s festivities would mark the first time she and the 49ers WAGs were hanging out. “This is the first time I’m hanging out with all of the other WAGs, wives and girlfriends, and I’m so excited!” Culpo exclaimed in a TikTok video as she got ready. “Everything’s just so much more fun with a good group of girls, or guys for that matter, just a good group of good people,” she continued. Warning: Explicit language Culpo later explained in the video how the 49ers influenced her New Year’s look. “I went with the red dress because I felt like it was the most 49ers-friendly,” she remarked. The 49ers, who clinched the NFC West in December 2022, will face the Raiders on Sunday afternoon before closing out the regular season next weekend against the Cardinals. Culpo has been supporting McCaffrey, 26, at 49ers games throughout the season. Last month, the Pro Bowler expressed gratitude for Culpo in an Instagram tribute. “With Me Through It All,” he wrote at the time. Culpo and McCaffrey have been dating for more than three years.
