If you’re headed back to the office this year, upgrading your commute might make the pain of saying bye to your WFH routine sting a little less. Since flying cars still aren’t commonplace, grab the next best thing with a sleek eBike. The BirdBike eBike provides an ultra-fast ride to get you to and from work… or wherever you like to play. And right now you can score the best price online right here, just $899, with free shipping for a limited time. The BirdBike eBike combines all the best parts of the bikes you know and love — from commuter bikes to mountain bikes to electric powered bikes — and turns them into one superior ride, complete with a powerful 500W motor. This eBike runs super efficiently even when it’s going at its top speed, and you’ve just got to press the handlebar’s throttle to increase your speed instantly.’ Whether you’re heading into the city or planning on traversing a tough road, the high-performance carbon drive train has been designed to wear well, eliminating the need for pesky chain maintenance. A removable battery can either be charged right on the bike or removed for convenient powering up, and you’ll have an embedded dash display to show you your speed, distance, pedal assist mode, and battery life as needed. An anti-theft alarm equipped with a 120-decibel alarm sound is also included to keep your bike secure. One ride and you’ll easily see why the BirdBike eBike scored 4.9 stars on TrustPilot, and why T3 says “the build quality, price and riding experience are all spot on.” It was crafted by the same team of vehicle designers and engineers who first brought us electric scooters, so it has an impressive pedigree behind it, too.
