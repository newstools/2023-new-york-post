A burglar was found fully clothed enjoying a soak in a bathtub of the Seattle house he broke into Friday night, cops say. The female homeowner returned to her house to find a window had been smashed, then  spotted the prowler lurking inside. She remained outside and called the cops, who eventually searched the home and discovered the unidentified clothed suspect relaxing in a bathtub of water. “The man was clothed but very wet, and the bathtub was full of water,” police said in a statement. The 27-year-old intruder was charged with residential burglary, and police said he did not come clean about why he broke in and took the bizarre bath. With AP
