Clemson basketball guard Brevin Galloway added some painful details to what the university labeled an “abdominal issue” Thursday night. Galloway doesn’t know why “my balls and my nut sack were exploded.” All Galloway did was lift in the morning and take a nap. Then, just three hours later, he had undergone surgery to reduce his testicles back to their normal size. “I don’t know what happened to my balls,” Galloway said in a video posted to his Instagram. “I guess they were trying to be like basketballs. “But we made it. Now, I’m going to be spoiled for the next 48 hours, and I will be back in a uniform shortly.” Stadium’s Jeff Goodman reported that Brad Brownell, the Tigers’ head coach, replied with a “no comment” when asked about Galloway’s post. Galloway tweeted the injury was the “worst pain I’ve ever experienced” and captioned in his Instagram Story that he would be out the next seven days. This is Galloway’s sixth year of playing college basketball. He started out at the College of Charleston for four years before transferring to Boston College. There, in 2021-22, he started five games for the Eagles, appeared in 23 total and averaged 8.3 points per game. But over the summer, he transferred again. This time, he jumped to an ACC school closer to his hometown of Anderson, South Carolina and latched on with the Tigers. He has become a full-time starter in Clemson’s lineup — averaging 10.6 points per game and hitting 3-pointers at a 33 percent clip, helping the Tigers to a better-than-expected start entering the bulk of Atlantic Coast Conference play. The Tigers were projected to finish 11th in the ACC preseason poll. But they’ve jumped out to a 17-4 record, including a 9-1 mark in conference games, and will have won their most games in a season since 2018-19 with one more victory.
