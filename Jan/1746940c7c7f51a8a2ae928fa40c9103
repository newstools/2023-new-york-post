Lisa Marie Presley’s twin daughters are “too traumatized” to return to their Los Angeles home after the sudden death of their mother, according to reports. Harper and Finley Lockwood, 14, have been spending time with their grandmother, Priscilla Presley, and their half-sister, Riley Keough, following the tragedy, TMZ reported. Lisa Marie, the only child of rock and roll legend Elvis and Priscilla Presley, died Jan. 12 after she went into cardiac arrest in her Calabasas, Calif. home. She was 54. And it seems as though the twins can’t shake the thought of returning to the home Lisa Marie fell faint in. Harper and Finley’s father, Michael Lockwood, has reportedly been keeping the girls under his watchful eye as they process the devastating news. Lisa Marie was married to the guitarist for a decade after tying the knot in 2006. His lawyer, Joe Yanny, told The Post last week that his “world has been turned on its ear.” “Michael had been hoping for a speedy and complete recovery because her children needed her,” Yanny said. “It is very sad it didn’t turn out that way.” It was recently revealed that Graceland, the iconic sprawling estate that once belonged to Elvis, will go to Riley, Harper, and Finley. The Graceland mansion always held significance for Lisa Marie and her family. It was her childhood home, and — more notably — it was where her father died aged 42. Last week, the Presley family announced that a public memorial for Lisa Marie will be held at the property on Jan. 22.
