Victor Cruz is living his best life in Barbados with a bikini-clad mystery woman. The Post obtained exclusive photos of the former Giants receiver and an unnamed brunette enjoying on the beach at a luxury resort in the Caribbean on Friday. Cruz and his apparent new flame were photographed laughing and lounging in a reserved seating area in the sand. At one point, they were seen sitting on their phones together, and eventually took a dip in the ocean. The brunette was seen adjusting her taupe-colored bandeau bikini while walking to the shore. She wore circular sunglasses and styled her hair in a top knot. Additionally, both Cruz and the unidentified woman were pictured wearing green wristbands. The former Pro Bowl wideout — who won a Super Bowl with the Giants in 2012 — made his way to the Green Monkey Golf Course at the Sandy Lane hotel in St. James, according to a series of videos on his Instagram story. It’s unclear if Cruz and the mystery woman are an item. The 36-year-old television host is believed to be single following his split from ex-girlfriend, actress Karrueche Tran in February 2021. Cruz and Tran dated for three years before calling it quits due to long distance, E! News reported at the time. Cruz lives in New Jersey with his daughter, Kennedy, who turns 11 this month, and the “Claws” actress resides in Los Angeles. At the time, a source told E! News there were no hard feelings, and that Cruz and Tran were focused on their respective careers. Cruz and Tran attended a number of red carpets and star-studded events throughout their relationship including, New York Fashion Week, the MTV Video Music Awards and the BET Awards. They went public with their romance in December 2017, when they stepped out holding hands on a date night in Los Angeles.
