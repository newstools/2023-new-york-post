Fashion designer Jill Stuart has sold her Hamptons home. The stunning Sagaponack property, at 113 Parsonage Lane, closed for $9.35 million earlier this month. It last asked $10.99 million. It first hit the market, with a different broker, for $13.99 million in June 2021. Two years before first listing the East End estate, Stuart sued her estranged husband Ron Curtis, her clothing company’s CEO, claiming she lost $25 million after he mismanaged a family trust. While Stuart could not be reached for comment, sources say the couple are still in divorce proceedings. The 5,000-square-foot modern farmhouse sits on 1.6 acres and comes with interiors by architect Annabelle Selldorf, who also did the interiors for Stuart’s six-bedroom condo at the Philip Johnson-designed Urban Glass House in Soho. The Hamptons home opens to a foyer that leads to a living room with a woodburning fireplace. There’s also an eat-in chef’s kitchen, a media/family room and a dining room with French doors that lead outside. The main floor also includes a junior bedroom suite and another guest bedroom. Upstairs, there are four ensuite bedrooms with a main bedroom that boasts another woodburning fireplace, a windowed dressing room and a spa-like bath. A pool house on the property has a gym, a bathroom and a laundry room. Outside, there are bluestone patios, a gas fire pit, a pool, a Jacuzzi, a four-car garage, landscaped gardens — and plenty of room to build tennis courts. The listing broker was Douglas Elliman’s Kelly Bensimon — the author, model, TV personality and “The Real Housewives of New York City” alum — and a potential cast member for its future spin-off series, “Legacy,” Page Six reported. Bensimon, a broker in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Florida, now heads a team of 12 and tells Gimme Shelter that she has a global business with clients in Paris, Brazil, London and Australia.
