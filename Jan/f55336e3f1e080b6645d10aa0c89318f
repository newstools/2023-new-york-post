Shootings in the Big Apple are bleeding taxpayers to death. Americans collectively spent at least $350 million to treat gunshot wounds in New York City hospitals alone over the course of a decade — with Brooklyn and the Bronx accounting for more than 70% of the city’s medical bill. Federal taxpayers — all of whom chip in for Medicaid and Medicare — were on the hook for between $30 million and $40 million annually to cover the cost of treating gunshot wounds across the five boroughs between 2010 and 2020, according to a new report by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In comparison, private spending was less than $60 million for the same decade-long period. The researchers, who analyzed data on over 10,400 hospital claims in New York State’s healthcare billing system, told The Post that this is not a local problem, but in fact, an issue that the whole country should be made aware of. Putting a price tag on the city’s gun violence may help the problem get attention from communities less directly affected by the problem, Dr. Jeffrey Butts, head of the Research & Evaluation Center at John Jay, said. “People should not delude themselves into thinking that if they live in a rural farm community, they do not have to worry about urban gun violence — because they are paying for that,” Butts said. Brooklyn got the most taxpayer dough — $132 million; followed by the Bronx at $116 million; Manhattan, nearly $50 million; Queens, $42 million; and Staten Island, $11 million.
