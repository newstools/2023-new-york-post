They finally closed the book on this case. A British library waived a $52,400 fee for a book that had been overdue — for 58 years. In 1964, then-17-year-old David Hickman checked out “The Law for Motorists” from the Dudley Library before a court visit over a minor traffic violation, the Express & Star reported. When the former Dudley resident moved to London in 1970, he brought the book with him. “I used to come across it now and then and think, ‘I must pop that back next time I’m in Dudley,'” Hickman told the outlet. “I even considered posting it anonymously, but then I decided I would face the music and take it back in person.” Library manager Sharon Whitehouse said she was happy to see the tome returned with its original cardboard tickets, and is hoping to donate it to a local museum. “I think that’s a great idea,” Hickman said.
