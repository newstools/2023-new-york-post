Lend him an ear. Jordan Peele revealed Friday while appearing on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” that he had bought Corey Feldman’s prosthetic ear from the 1986 film “Stand by Me.” The 43-year-old actor said he won the ear during an auction that Feldman had staged around his 50th birthday. “There was a whole thing where he was auctioning the ear that he wore as Teddy in ‘Stand by Me’ and I guess I very creepily bought it,” said Peele. “In saying it out loud, I realize how creepy it was. That’s not the thing you should share.” “I mentioned it to him and he’s like, ‘Wait, you got the ear,’” Peele said. “I was like, ‘Yeah’ and he was like, ‘Man, I’m so glad it was you.’” Peele said he gave Feldman, 51, the earful during the Lincoln Center series “The Lost Rider: A Chronicle of Hollywood Sacrifice,”  which featured several of Feldman’s films such as “Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,” “Stand by Me” and the unreleased “The Birthday.” ““I have a new friendship with Corey Feldman, very proud of this,” Peele said. “He invited me and my producer to his house. We went to his house, which was awesome. It has some memorabilia and stuff. By the way, if you don’t know Corey Feldman, it means — first of all — f–k off, you’re a kid. But this is, like, one of the greatest teen icons of all time.” “We visit and he has this film that he showed called ‘The Birthday’ that was unreleased,” continued Peele. “If you are a cinephile who is just into a complete what-the-F-did-I-just-watch experience, it is this treasure. So the thing is kind of leading up to this missing film because the movie ‘Nope’ in itself is about exploitation and erasure.” Feldman had also previously joked that the owner of the ear would have limitless ways to use the appendage. “I don’t know what you’re going to do with the ear,” Feldman said. “Wear it for Halloween, throw darts at it, use it as a coaster! The possibilities are limitless.”
