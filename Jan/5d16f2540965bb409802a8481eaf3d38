Wynonna Judd has given her “genuinely concerned” fans an update about her mental health. Judd, 58, posted a video on Instagram in response to a comment a fan wrote on Facebook, noting concern that she was being “pushed too hard.” “I’m worried that her ‘manager’ is pushing her too hard,” the comment, which Judd attached to her video, read. “The term ‘hit it while you’re hot’ was used. I don’t believe that is in her best interest mentally and physically. For God’s sake … she just tragically lost her mother. Seems like her manager is getting a little greedy at the expense of her health. She just doesn’t appear well. I would like to see her take an extended break for her own mental and physical health.” “Well, I’m OK,” Judd started the video. “I have heard some of the comments and the first thought I had was: opinions and buttholes. And then I realized people are genuinely concerned, so I wanted to respond to that piece.” “I am working so hard on my mental, physical and spiritual well-being,” she continued. “I have a great team. I’m really blessed, and I’m broken, and I’m working really hard at self-care, which is not selfish. It’s sacred.” The singer explained that while she has a “very full schedule,” she also has time off to be at her farm, take walks in the woods and spend time with her family and dogs. “The last thing I’ll say is: can’t keep a good woman down too long,” she concluded. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, died by suicide on April 30 at age 76 after a long battle with mental illness. “Today we sisters experienced a tragedy. We lost our beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness. We are shattered. We are navigating profound grief and know that as we loved her, she was loved by her public,” Wynonna and her sister Ashley Judd said in a statement at the time of their mother’s passing. “We are in unknown territory.”
