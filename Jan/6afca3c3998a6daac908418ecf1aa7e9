Lucky for you (and us, and everyone we know) it’s nearly tax season again. In just a few short months, as we start to shed our winter jackets, past Valentine’s Day and President’s Day Weekend, as the snow melts and the streets thaw, as fawns take their first, hesitant steps somewhere in a sun-drenched meadow. As birds sit on dripping branches and sing, as fields of daffodils and tulips push themselves upwards and open, as the world turns again and we’re welcomed back into the reprieve of Spring, and remember what a joy it is to walk and talk outside. As all that’s happening, and you walk outside without wincing against the cold for the first time in months, full of life and energy for what feels like the first time since October. Just there, as you try out your first T-shirt day of the still-new year, and you take deep breaths of fresh, warm air through your nose, you’ll remember, in a flash “Oh man, I think I totally forgot to do my taxes.” No, it’s not fun to think about, but they’ve got to get done. Do yourself a favor this year, and get a jump start, for less, with this great deal on TurboTax software from Amazon. Earlier this week (Jan. 23) marked the first day that the IRS began accepting and processing federal tax returns for the year. As we alluded to in our intro, Tax Day doesn’t fall until Apr. 18, but there’s no reason not to get a head start, especially with savings like this. TurboTax recommends this software if you “sold stock, employee stock, bonds or mutual funds, own rental property, or are a trust beneficiary.” If that’s you, act fast. This deal, like the fleeting, opening notes of Spring, won’t last for long. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
