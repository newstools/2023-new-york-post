Most music festivals stretch three days and space their top-billed headliners out so fans have to wait hours to see the mega stars on the lineup perform. The 2023 iHeartRadio ALTer Ego does away with all that pageantry and will give the audience exactly what they want — back to back headliners over the course of a single evening. On Saturday, Jan. 14, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jack White, Muse and Fall Out Boy will all take the stage at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum for what is the early frontrunner for rock event of the year. Phoenix, CHVRCHES, Beach Weather and Rosa Linn are set to rock out as well. Now, that’s a lineup. And while most festivals charge an arm and leg for general admission passes, ALTer Ego is surprisingly affordable given all the talent on display. At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on tickets was $70 before fees on Vivid Seats. Lower-level seats start at $133 before fees. $165 before fees is as low as floor seats get which is more than fair given the talent involved. All prices are subject to fluctuation. Can’t make it to LA on Jan. 14 and want to see Anthony Kiedis and co? You’re in luck. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have a tour of their own from March 29 through May 25 this year.  While we may have complained about festivals up top, we gotta admit, we love a good three-day summer soiree complete with up-and-coming acts alongside established stars we know and love. And if you’re anything like us, we know you do too. That’s why we humbly present to you, a quick peek at the five biggest festivals you’ll want to keep an eye out for this year. • Rolling Loud in Inglewood, CA (March 3-5) • Coachella Arts and Music Festival in Indio, CA (April 14-16 and April 21-23) • Bonnaroo in Manchester, TN (June 15-18) • Lollapalooza in Chicago, IL (Aug. 3-6) • Outside Lands in San Francisco, CA (Aug. 11-13)
