Childlike curiosity doesn’t have an expiration date, and looking toward the sky is a way for many of us to feel that excitement all over again. Treat yourself or the wannabe pilot in your life by exploring the skies anytime without leaving the ground by taking advantage of a limited-time offer. Through January 30, we’re celebrating adults who are kids at heart by dropping the price of a pair of advanced drones equipped with 4K front cameras from $398 to $129.99. That’s nearly 70% savings on a package of devices primed to stir excitement for children of all ages. Double the fun with the Alpha Z PRO 4K and Flying Fox 4K Wide-Angle Dual-Camera drones, which supply the aforementioned 4K cameras up front and 720p cameras below.

That ability to gain far-ranging footage is a valuable resource for those who require aerial video production, such as real estate ventures or sports programs.

These drones operate for up to 10 minutes of sustained flight following a charge. They feature WiFi capability, supplying real-time transmission through connected phones, and gain real-time FPV monitoring on the corresponding app, Lightweight and featuring foldable arms, the drones operate with a one-key automatic return and can be transported with ease.
