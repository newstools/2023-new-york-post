New year, new Paige. Paige Spiranac launched the subscription-based content site OnlyPaige this week, teasing fans on social media about what they can expect from the source of “All Things Paige.” “Full golf instruction series for chipping, putting full swing and more …,” the golf influencer, 29, captioned one Instagram Story, per The Sun. “Or maybe you don’t care about my sexiest pictures ever.” The photos in question will likely live in “The Bunker” section of OnlyPaige, which will be updated frequently and for subscriber-eyes only. Spiranac will also give fans a look into her life both on and off the golf course, not to mention live streams and Q&As. “My followers have been asking me forever to join a subscription site and I really love the idea of a subscription program but I wanted to do it in a way that felt comfortable to me and felt authentic,” Spiranac said in a new interview with Forbes. Spiranac, who was crowned the “World’s Sexiest Woman” by Maxim last summer, added that “it’s been a long journey of figuring out what it was going to look like and make all my followers really happy.” “We wanted to make this a little different, feel a little more personal and also have the golf content be elevated,” she said. Spiranac continued to hype her site Thursday, revealing in an Instagram Story how subscribers will be able to check out her first live stream on Friday. “I think now is a great time to subscribe!” she captioned a photo of herself in a plunging red sweater. OnlyPaige subscribers can pay either $9.99 monthly for content or a yearly plan of $95.50.
