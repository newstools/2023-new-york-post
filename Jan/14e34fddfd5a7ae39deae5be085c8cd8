LeBron James is Team Sharpe. After Shannon Share and Tee Morant got into a heated courtside exchange on Friday night at the Lakers-Grizzlies game in Los Angeles, James threw his support behind the NFL Hall of Famer and Fox Sports personality. “I ride with Shannon 365 days — 366 on a leap year — 24/7. So that’s my guy,” James told reporters after the game. “I always got his back and he’s got mine. He can talk with the best of them, for sure.” Sharpe had to be separated from Ja Morant’s father, Tee, at halftime after the two had been jawing at each other. Video of the incident showed Grizzlies wing Dillon Brooks yelling in Sharpe’s direction as he walked toward Memphis’ bench, with Sharpe yelling back and Brooks’ teammate, Steven Adams, also getting involved. Tee Morant then walked toward Sharpe and exchanged words with him as security tried to defuse the situation. “They didn’t want this smoke,” Sharpe told ESPN after the incident. “They do all that talking and jockeying and I ain’t about the jockeying. It started with Dillon Brooks. I said he was too small to guard LeBron. He said ‘F–k’ me I said, ‘F–k’ you back. He started to come at me and I said, ‘You don’t want these problems.’ “And then Ja came out of nowhere talking. He definitely didn’t want these problems. Then the dad came and he obviously didn’t want no problems. But I wanted anything they had. Don’t let these fools fool you now.” Later in the game, Sharpe and Tee Morant were seen hugging it out. “I ain’t talking about that,” Brooks told reporters when asked about the altercation. “You can ask him. He’s the blogger or whatever he is. I don’t really care about all that.”
