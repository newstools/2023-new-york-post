Who let the dogs out? IKEA shoppers were forced to put together something other than furniture when two men dressed as dogs appeared to be “walked” by a third man in the store, according to a Twitter video posted Sunday. The video, shot by a man named Alan Watson, showed the trio at the food court near the showroom with the two “dogs” wagging their tails. “A guy just taking his 2 dogs a walk in IKEA Edinburgh,” he captioned the video, which has been viewed over 36,000 times as of Tuesday morning. The group gained many stares from shoppers, including one father with his kid, as the group made their way through the cafeteria. In BDSM, this behavior is commonly called “puppy play,” in which one party dresses up as a dog and exhibits similar characteristics as part of role-play, sometimes conducted in both public and private. Many people on Twitter also expressed their shock at the appearance of the “pups.” “Aaaand I think that’s enough internet for tonight,” tweeted an aghast user. “Right off to bed,” tweeted another person. “This being within a mile of my house has made me uncomfortable. 5 bedroom house in Loanhead hitting the market soon,” chimed in a third person.
