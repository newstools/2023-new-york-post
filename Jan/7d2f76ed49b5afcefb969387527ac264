Earl Boen, a veteran character actor best known for appearing in the “Terminator” series, has died at 81, a family member has confirmed. The New York native reportedly passed away Thursday in Hawaii — however, his cause of death has yet to be disclosed, TMZ reported. Born in 1941 in New York City, Boen is perhaps most widely recognized for his part in the “Terminator” franchise. He portrayed Dr. Peter Silberman, the cynical psychologist who initially doesn’t believe Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese’s (Michael Biehn) warnings about the titular time-traveling cyborg assassin. Along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the thespian was the only actor to appear in all of the first three films — “The Terminator,” “Terminator 2: Judgement Day” and “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.” He reprised the role for 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate” as well. Boen’s other film credits include “Battle Beyond the Stars,” “The Man With Two Brains,” “Alien Nation,” “Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult” and “Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.” The actor also did voiceover work for numerous video games, including “Call of Duty,” the “World of Warcraft” series and “Tales of Monkey Island.” In the latter, he lent his voice to the LeChuck, a fearsome pirate and the main antagonist of the franchise. Boen is survived by his wife Cathy, his stepdaughter Ruby and two grandchildren, Kimmy Abaricia and Kimo Harbin. His first wife, Carole Kean, who was also an actress, passed away in 2001 at age 58 following a short battle with ovarian cancer.
