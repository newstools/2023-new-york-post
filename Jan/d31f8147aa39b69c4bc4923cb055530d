In his most effective action yet on the illegal-migrant crisis, President Joe Biden on Sunday . . . went to El Paso, for his first border visit since taking office and opening the floodgates. Yes, it was empty symbolism (and a cynical gambit serving his plans to run in 2024) for barely three hours — but even setting the stage for the gesture had real-world consequences, as border agents and local cops cleared El Paso’s streets of migrants who’d camped out because the city’s shelters are beyond full. They even sent many back over the border to Mexico, enforcing Biden’s new “get (kind of) tough on refugees from socialist disasters” policy. Of course, the evicted migrants will start flowing right back as soon as Biden skips town (hint: say you’re Columbia, not Venezuela, or just evade the Border Patrol entirely as hundreds of thousands of others have done). But we’re sure the people of El Paso will appreciate the respite. Cynics may draw parallels to the way DC cops rousted the homeless from Union Station in advance of the president’s “Republicans hate democracy” speech, and the videos of migrants pleading with cops may break a few hearts — and it won’t do a thing to stop surging fentanyl smuggling — but it’s still Biden’s most effective move yet to stem the tide. Seriously: The plan he dropped last week is beyond pathetic, merely a recognition that even Democrat pols across the country are finding the influx too much. Biden still shows no sign of rethinking his fundamental “wave ’em in” policy. Still, we bet every other town on the border is hoping for a presidential visit. At least it’s something.
