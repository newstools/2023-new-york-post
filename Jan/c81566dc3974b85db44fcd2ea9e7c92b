Democrats controlling the New York Assembly will not seek to overturn the result of a Brooklyn race that saw a Republican oust a veteran legislator over a residency technicality. Lester Chang will the keep the seat for which he was just sworn in this week after Democrats raised questions about whether he established a legal residency to Brooklyn in time before the November election. “After careful review, the vast majority of our members have significant concerns about the truthfulness of Mr. Chang’s documentary evidence and testimony regarding his compliance with the New York State Constitution,” Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement released late Friday afternoon. “Although it is clear that there were more than enough votes to expel Mr. Chang, we will not do so at this time,” the leader said. Asian Americans have expressed outrage at the possibility of Chang getting booted from representing District 49 covering parts of Bay Ridge, Dykers Heights and Bensonhurst following his narrow win over entrenched Democratic Assemblyman Peter Abbate, Jr. While Chang is keeping his seat “at this time,” he is not legally in the clear quite yet, according to Heastie, who said “relevant criminal, civil and administrative authorities” will review potential legal violations. “This includes the unrefuted evidence related to Mr. Chang’s Manhattan rent-regulated apartment and the government subsidies he accessed,” Heastie said.
