MOOSIC, Pa. — Former Yankee Shelley Duncan was hired Friday to manage the franchise’s top farm team, the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. Duncan won the International League MVP award with Scranton in 2009. The 43-year-old Duncan was drafted by the Yankees in 2001 and hit .231 with 43 homers and 144 RBIs in the majors for the Yankees (2007-09), Cleveland (2010-12) and Tampa Bay. He is replacing Doug Davis, Scranton’s manager for the past three seasons. Duncan managed Arizona’s short-season Class A Hillsboro affiliate in 2015 and 2017, High A Visalia in 2016 and Double-A Jackson in 2019. He became Toronto’s major league field coordinator in 2019 and spent the past two seasons as analytics coordinator with the White Sox.
