This bouncer really does have arms of steel. A Las Vegas strip club has deployed a massive robotic bouncer to welcome tech leaders from across the world attending a weekend conference. Mech “The Bot” Johnson, a 15-foot-tall and 8,800-pound human-controlled robot suit, is working with Sapphire Las Vegas’ security detail during the four-day Consumer Electronics Show that kicked off Thursday. The robot will be stationed outside the strip club’s gates to keep those waiting in line thoroughly entertained, likely because it is too massive to fit through any door frames. “He will be protecting us all from the Ai bots taking over the Las Vegas #CES convention so that you may party worry free all weekend long!” the club said in an Instagram post. Weighing nearly 4.6-tons, The Bot is a “human-controlled giant, powered all-terrain robotic ‘mech’ suit” that was flown in from Vancouver for CES, Sapphire Las Vegas said. Mech suits are usually massive four-legged armored suits that have the power to lift heavy objects by augmenting the strength of the human stationed inside. “It only makes sense that the world’s largest gentlemen’s club would have the world’s largest security guard,” Peter Feinstein, the club’s managing partner, said in a statement.
