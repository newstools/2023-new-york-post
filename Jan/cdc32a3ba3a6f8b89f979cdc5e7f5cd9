It came back to bite him. A DoorDash driver is under fire for filming himself taking a bite of a customer’s burrito because he only received a stingy 50-cent gratuity. In a TikTok video, the unnamed driver — who posts under the username @doordashtips3  — opens the DoorDash bag and begins nibbling on the Chipotle order in a bid for revenge. “Yummy, yummy,” he says as he bites into the item. “Thank you, DoorDash customer!” Many users were outraged by the audacious act, with some calling for the company to fire the man. “This is disgusting and gives the rest of us Dashers a bad name,” wrote one woman on the video, which has been viewed more than 242,000 times. “It’s why I never use DoorDash since you never know what the driver will do to your food!” another chimed in. It’s not the first time the user has punished a poor tipper, with several videos on his profile showing him refusing to pick up orders with no tips. However, some skeptics have questioned the authenticity of the videos and believe they’re a bid for attention. “These videos clearly are fake, they seal the bags for delivery,” one user said. However, another pointed out that even if it’s a social media stunt, it could be encouraging copycats to do the same. “This might not be real but now he got actual DoorDash drivers doing it,” the user wrote. The Post has reached out to DoorDash for comment. Undertipping food delivery drivers is a hot topic on TikTok, with drivers often airing their grievances at the lack of tips they receive on orders. One UberEats driver called out customers for “tip baiting,” a practice whereby customers offer a large tip when placing the order, only to lower it once the food has been delivered.
