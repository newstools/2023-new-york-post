The Grizzlies are the hottest team in the NBA after tying a team record with their 11th straight win on Wednesday. For a group that’s been vocal about its perception in a crowded West, I’d expect a fiery effort against the Lakers in Los Angeles on Friday with a chance to elevate the franchise mark. Memphis hasn’t just strung together a series of close wins — it has been outright smacking teams during the streak. The Grizzlies have boasted the NBA’s best net rating (+12.3) across those nearly dozen games, winning more than half of them by double digits after a 30-point win over the Suns on Monday. Unsurprisingly, Ja Morant has been at the heart of it all. He’s scored at least 20 points in each of his last eight starts and is averaging 28.3 points and 8.1 assists on 53 percent shooting since Memphis’ win streak began on Dec. 29 — only LeBron James (36.4 ppg), Joel Embiid (31.9) and Kevin Durant (33) have scored more points on a higher percentage across the same span. Speaking of James, his high scoring rate hasn’t meant much in the win-loss column, as the Lakers have dropped four of their last five games after a brief five-game win streak that had some expecting a turnaround. That one win? A home victory over the tanking Rockets. That doesn’t exactly inspire confidence with the red-hot Grizzlies coming to town. Grizzlies -7 (FanDuel)
