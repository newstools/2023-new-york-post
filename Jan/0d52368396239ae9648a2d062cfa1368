Obsessed “Succession” fans still have to wait until the spring for Season 4 — but in the meantime, we are bringing you an exclusive sneak peek into the Tribeca building where Siobhan “Shiv” Roy (Sarah Snook) will reside in a trophy penthouse. Though fictional in its portrayal as her actual home, the spread in real life is at 270 Broadway, our spies say. And for those who want to live like the character, the unit directly below the penthouse is on the market for $5.99 million. That 26th-floor loft is 3,549 square feet. It features four bedrooms, 3½ baths and stunning city views. There’s also an industrial-style chef’s kitchen, a laundry room, 35 windows, four exposures — plus lots of storage and walk-in closets. The current sellers bought the unit for $4 million in 2008. The building, which dates to 1930, converted to condos in 2002. Amenities include an Art Deco lobby, three fitness areas, a children’s playroom, a teen media room, a board room, bike storage and a landscaped roof deck with views from the Hudson River to the Brooklyn Bridge. The building, on the corner of Chambers Street across from City Hall Park, also comes with quite the history. In 1942, it was home base — and the first headquarters — for the Manhattan Project, the top-secret atomic bomb program. The building also housed Stone & Webster, a Boston-based engineering firm tasked with building a Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant to produce enriched uranium, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation.
