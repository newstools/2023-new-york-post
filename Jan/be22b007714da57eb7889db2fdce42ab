Ja Morant’s thunderous dunk on Saturday night went viral. It also left Kevin Durant speechless. The Nets superstar was only able to tweet a slew of crying memes in reference to the 6-foot-3 Morant’s vicious third-quarter throw down over 6-foot-10 Pacers defender Jalen Smith in the Grizzlies 130-112 win. Durant wasn’t the only NBA player struggling to find the words after the Memphis star rattled the rim. “OMGGGGGGGGGG,” two-time All-Star Isaiah Thomas tweeted. Morant himself called the jam his best one yet. “Yeah, easy,” he told reporters. “It’s what everybody has been waiting for. I finally made it.” With the wait over, NBA stars past and current weighed in on the Dunk of the Year candidate. “Bruh just do the mf dunk contest,” Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell, who won the NBA’s dunk content in 2018, wrote on Twitter. ESPN’s Kendrick Perkins, a longtime NBAer himself, pushed for Morant to start the 2023 All-Star game — despite the fact he’s currently third in All-Star fan voting for guard behind Luka Doncic and Steph Curry. “The fans want to see HIGHLIGHTS… and that’s exactly what Ja Morant is going to give you,” Perkins tweeted. “The MOST ELECTRIFYING PLAYER in the NBA!!!” Basketball Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett saw the 23-year-old’s slam as the latest in a line of viral jams, with many yet to come. “When we look back on Ja’s in game dunk highlights when it’s all said and done it’s gonna be up there with the some of the greatest ever,” Garnett wrote on Twitter. Morant, however, simply gave credit where it was due. “IT’S THE JA1s,” he tweeted in reference to his signature Nike sneakers. “IT’S THE SHOES.”
