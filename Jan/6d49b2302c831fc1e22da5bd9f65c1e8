With these clothes steamers that you’ll use following your laundry detergent-pouring and tumble-drying days, wrinkles won’t stand a chance. So long are the days of the fold-and-pop-up irons (though some people still use them). With one of the best clothes steamers we rounded up, you’ll have all of your garments feeling fresh, crisp and — of course — wrinkle-free. We cut out the research for you so you don’t have to and named the five clothes steamers as the very best of 2023. We use one of these weekly, and we recommend snagging one for all of your dress pants and cozy sweaters  (oh, and just about everything in your closet). That’s right — we’re all talk about spring cleaning already. For more, check out our expert-backed guides on house cleaning products and closet organizers. While any clothes steamer is sure to make your cleaning routine (1) more convenient and (2) much quicker, we kept a few considerations in mind when selecting the best products on the market: When on a budget, you certainly don’t want to compromise value — and that’s exactly where the Hilife Portable Handheld Steamer comes into play. It’s one of the most compact and *truly* portable options out there, and you can’t beat the $30 price ticket. Since our dorm days at college, we’ve been using the Rowenta X-Cel Powerful Handheld Fabric Steamer (and yes, it’s powerful!) It takes about a minute to fully heat up and the amount of steam it generates is truly impressive. Plus, the water tank is simple to use and refill. The Conair Turbo ExtremeSteam Handheld Fabric Steamer is one of our top picks, namely for its ability to —quite instantly — smooth out wrinkles. It heats up in 40 seconds, has a water tank that lasts for 15 minutes of continuous steam and an easy-to-use design. Finally, a clothes steamer designed for travel. For less than $25 right now, the Beautural Foldable Handheld Wrinkle-Removing Clothes Steamer is one we have in our Amazon carts ahead of this year’s travels. Whether you put in in your luggage or your carry-on, it’s perfect for the job. Quickly pick up the PurSteam Handheld Clothes Steamer if you just want something that’ll do the job in a well-designed way. Notably, this model boasts a leak-proof design and an ultra-ergonomic handle, though it doesn’t heat up in seconds like some other models. Nevertheless, it’s still a quality household product to add to your cart. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
