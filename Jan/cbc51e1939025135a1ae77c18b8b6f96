Medical supply mogul and philanthropist Shlomo Rechnitz, and his wife Tamar, have listed a Los Angeles investment property in Hancock Park for a cool $26 million. Hancock Park is the neighborhood where the prolific screenwriter and producer Shonda Rhimes — known for her popular hits, such as “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Bridgerton” — recently sold her 1923 home for an area record of $21 million, according to the LA Times. (Rhimes bought the home from “Everybody Loves Raymond” actress Patricia Heaton for $8.8 million in 2014, the paper also reported.) There’s already a bidding war for the Rechnitz property, which has been on the market for less than three weeks, Josh Nass, Rechnitz’s spokesman, told Gimme Shelter. The Rechnitz family bought the property at 101 N. Hudson Ave. for $11.5 million in September 2020. Built in 1929 by architect Roland Coate, the Tudor-style home was featured in Architectural Digest in 1931, according to the listing, and was restored by Mark Stevens Construction and MR Design. At 14,649 square feet, the seven-bedroom home sits on 0.96 acres. It features a large living room with a fireplace, a cigar lounge with coffered ceilings — plus a formal dining room, a chef’s kitchen and a butler’s pantry. Details include crown moldings, herringbone floors, diamond-pane leaded windows, mahogany-paneled walls and built-in cabinetry. The main bedroom suite comes with a bay window, a balcony and double spa-like bathrooms. There are also two home offices with fireplaces, a gym with a bar/lounge space, a spa/massage room, a home theater and a children’s playroom. Outside, there’s a pool, an outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven, two fire pits and a pickleball/half-basketball court. Neighbors on the street include Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne. The listing brokers are brothers Josh and Matthew Altman, of Douglas Elliman.
