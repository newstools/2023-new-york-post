Lisa Marie Presley, 54, is reportedly in the hospital after possibly going into cardiac arrest. TMZ reported Thursday that sources claim Elvis and Priscilla Presley’s daughter went into “full arrest” and paramedics performed CPR on her at her Calabasas home before transporting her to the hospital. They reportedly “administered epinephrine at the scene at least one time in order to help Presley regain a pulse.” Her current condition is unclear, the outlet added. A rep for Presley had no comment when contacted by The Post. Lisa Marie and Priscilla, 77,  just attended the Golden Globes on Tuesday to watch Austin Butler score an award for his portrayal of The King in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic. He even shouted them out in his acceptance speech. “The Presley family, thank you guys for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me,” he told the Tennessee natives. “Lisa Marie and Priscilla, I love you forever.” Lisa Marie was her parents’ only child. She herself has been married four times: Danny Keough, Michael Jackson, Nicolas Cage, and Michael Lockwood. Presley had four children, including a son, Benjamin Keough who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at age 27 on July 12, 2020. Keough and Presley also share their daughter, Riley Keough, 33. She also has 14-year-old twin daughters, Finley Aaron Love and Harper Vivienne Anne, with Lockwood.
