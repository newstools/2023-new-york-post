Tom Cruise failed in his mission. In a newly resurfaced clip on TikTok, “Neighbors” actor Seth Rogen recounted the time that Tom Cruise attempted to recruit him into Scientology. The 23-second clip of Rogen’s May 2021 interview on Howard Stern’s podcast was posted Saturday by an account called Movie Maniacs and has gained nearly 2 million views. In the video Rogen, 40, says that the “Mission: Impossible” actor, 60, tried to sit him down and explain the “truth” behind the religion. “He said, ‘If you just let me tell you what it was really about. If you let me … just give me like 20 minutes or really just tell you what it was about,'” said Rogen in the video. “You would say, ‘No f–kin’ way,’ ‘No f–kin’ way.'” Rogen recalled asking him to elaborate on whether the surprise would be a good — or bad — one. “I remember being like ‘Is that a good thing to be saying,” said Rogen. “Oof dodged that bullet.” The Post has reached out for comment. TikTok users were quick to jump into the conversation. “Tom Cruise got those 1997 marketing skills,” joked one user. “Every pyramid scheme pitch ever,” quipped another. One user even boldly pointed to Leah Remini, who famously exited Scientology and frequently speaks out against the religion, and her award-winning series on the subject. They added: “It covers absolutely everything. I recommend.”
