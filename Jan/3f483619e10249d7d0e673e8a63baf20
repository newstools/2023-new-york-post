You can’t predict emergencies (that’s what makes them emergencies). But thanks to smartphone tech, you can be prepared. Check these settings on your iPhone before you need them. Your phone’s Do Not Disturb mode is handy when you’re busy at work or just want some peace and quiet. It silences calls, alerts, and notifications while your phone is locked. Your iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to keep track of your Apple devices. Everything from your Airpods to your MacBook can be located with this vital tool. If you lose or misplace an Apple product, you can see it on a map to track it down. You can also play a sound to pinpoint its location. The Find My app has other uses. You can invite friends and family members to share their locations with you so you can keep in touch with each other and know when someone has gotten home safely. Once you set up Family Sharing, you can locate your loved ones’ devices and your own. And there’s a bonus here: The same alert you send to find your missing device can grab the attention of someone whose phone is in Do Not Disturb mode.
