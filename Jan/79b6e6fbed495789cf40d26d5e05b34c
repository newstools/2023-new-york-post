Adele’s ailments refuse to go easy on her. The British songstress, 34, was seen hobbling across the stage at her Las Vegas show on New Year’s Eve, telling the crowd she was struggling with chronic back pain. “I’ve just got to get over to the other side of the stage,” the crooner was seen saying in a video obtained exclusively by the Daily Star. “I have to waddle these days as I have really bad sciatica.” Adele has been struggling with back pain for almost two decades, telling the Face that the issues started at age 15 after she slipped a disk while sneezing. A slipped disk — also called a ruptured or herniated disk — occurs when the soft cushion of tissue between the bones in the spine pushes out. “I’ve been in pain with my back for, like, half of my life, really. It flares up, normally due to stress or from a stupid bit of posture,” the “Easy On Me” crooner told the publication. Adele admitted that her 100-pound weight loss and intense exercise regime — including core work — had helped alleviate some of the issues. “I got my tummy strong, down at the bottom, which I never had before, [and] my back [doesn’t] play up as much,” she stated. “It means I can do more, I can run around with my kid a little bit more.” The songstress is partway through her five-month residency in Vegas, and isn’t just speaking out about her physical ailments. During a Sin City show in December,  Adele also got candid about some of her mental health struggles. “I started having therapy again because I went a few years without. I needed to start,” she said. “Before, obviously, when I was going through my divorce, I was basically doing five therapy sessions a day.” “But now I am doing it because I just want to make sure I’m topping myself up every week to make sure I can give you everything,” she further told the crowd of high-paying spectators. “Weekends with Adele” is planned to continue until March 25, 2023, at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.
