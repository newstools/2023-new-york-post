A 16-year-old boy was beaten unconscious over a pair of Air Jordans in front of an upper Manhattan McDonald’s Saturday. A group of brutes walked up to the teen outside the chain location at 3543 Broadway around 9:15 p.m. and began viciously punching and kicking the teen until he was knocked out, police said. The attackers then snatched the Air Jordan sneakers the teen was wearing right off his feet, according to cops. The victim was rushed to Harlem Hospital in stable condition while the group scattered and fled. The suspects remain at large. Police are asking anyone with information regarding the attack or suspects to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
