Jason Derulo is hoping things don’t “Get Ugly.” Derulo, 33, broke his foot while playing basketball with his friends — but he’s not going to let that stop him from following through with his big Super Bowl performance. The singer was announced as this year’s headliner of the NFL TikTok Tailgate alongside the Black Keys, which occurs before the big game. However, Derulo is now walking with a cane and has a small break in his foot and a torn ligament after going for a rebound and landing on someone’s foot, according to TMZ. He did not have to undergo surgery but had stem cells injected to help speed up his recovery and he is going to physical therapy daily. Derulo is expecting to go through with the show regardless of whether or not he’s recovered from his injury — even if he needs a little help from his cane. The Super Bowl comes with weeklong events full of music and parties — including the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest, Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Tailgate and Rolling Stone Live. Rihanna will be headlining the Apple Music halftime show, which will be produced by DPS, with Roc Nation and Jesse Collins as executive producers and Hamish Hamilton as director. The Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles will face off at the Super Bowl LVII on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
