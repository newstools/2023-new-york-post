She has a point. Eileen Li, an acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist from Connecticut, claims the trick to combating drowsiness and fatigue could be simpler than you think. She recommends pressing a “reset button” between your nose and upper lip to “stimulate alertness.” In a new Instagram video, Li demonstrates how to activate the acupuncture spot known as DU-26. She suggests finding the point and using your nails, knuckles or even a pen to slightly push up towards the nose. “Once you find the point, you want to dig in and hold it there for 20 seconds,” Li advised before warning, “Your eyes might water, and your sinuses might open up, but you’ll definitely feel awake.” The specialist says DU-26 has been used to revive people who have fainted. Hundreds of grateful comments poured in from Li’s followers, who commended her for her helpful tip clip, which has been viewed 1.3 million times since it was posted late last month. “This was perfect timing, I had major back pain from wrapping presents today … I tried it, and about half way in, I felt the pain went away — thank you,” one user gushed. “Holy moly! That is amazing!” agreed another. Others said the trick helped them during medical scares. “Everyone should be taught this — this knowledge could literally save someone’s life!” someone wrote. Another person added: “Before the EMT’s arrived, my mother used this point to restore consciousness to my grandfather. Let’s say it was a life saver at the time.” Researchers believe acupuncture also may help cure women’s lack of libido, claiming the Chinese treatment helped every woman who participated in a study published in the journal Sexual Medicine in August.
