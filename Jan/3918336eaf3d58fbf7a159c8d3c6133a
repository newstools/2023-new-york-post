The Rangers have signed forward Jimmy Vesey to a two-year contract extension through the 2024-25 season, the team announced Wednesday. Vesey’s deal carries an average annual value of $800,000, according to The Post’s Mollie Walker. Through 38 games this year, the 29-year-old has scored six goals and compiled 12 points, while also carving out a role on the Blueshirts’ penalty-kill unit. The Predators originally drafted Vesey as their third-round selection in 2012, but he ended up signing an entry-level deal with the Rangers in 2016 as a free agent. Vesey also spent time with the Sabres, Maple Leafs, Canucks and Devils after his first stint in New York before returning to the Rangers. He originally joined on a professional tryout contract before signing a one-year deal in October ahead of the season. That contract served as the foundation — and window of opportunity — for Vesey’s next deal. The league’s negotiating window for general managers and players on one-year deals opened Sunday, according to The Post’s Larry Brooks, and just three days later, Vesey’s next stage, after playing for five teams since the 2019-20 season began, has been solidified.
