Avid puzzlers and real-estate buffs rejoice: The perfect game has been released. If the feature you’ve always thought Zillow was missing was the ability to guess the price of the house you’re snooping on, then Housle is the game is for you. Housle puts your appraisal skills to the test by drip-feeding clues to help users correctly guess the asking price of a property in six tries. The game, created by Los Angeles reality TV producer Doug Weitzbuch, was inspired by his love of Wordle, the now New York Times-owned game that soared to popularity at this time in 2022 — which prompts users to guess a five-letter word daily. So, are you a residential market whiz? Users are first given an image of a house with a one-sentence clue and asked to type in their guess. With every wrong guess, more clues — including location, square footage, or number of bedrooms and bathrooms — and images of the house are revealed. Players must guess within 5% of the asking price to win. Weitzbuch told Insider the idea for the game came from his experience of working on Netflix’s reality show “Buy My House,” where homeowners from across the country pitch their properties for sale to real estate investors. Weitzbuch, who is married to a real estate broker, added his love of Wordle also inspired him to combine his two passions of daily puzzles and real estate. Weitzbuch selects Housle’s home of the day himself, carefully trawling through property listings all over the US.
