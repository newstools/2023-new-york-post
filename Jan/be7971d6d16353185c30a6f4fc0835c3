You may be able to walk the walk — but are you burning as many calories as you can? Walking in a “silly” fashion actually counts as vigorous exercise — and can burn more calories — according to a new study conducted by Arizona State University Prof. Glenn Gaesser. Inspired by the classic “Ministry of Silly Walks” skit featured in “Monty Python,” researcher Gaesser decided to look into what the caloric payoff was for walking in the same style — with one leg arching way up and extending way out. The study, which was published in a report in the British Medical Journal, studied 13 healthy adults as they performed three, five-minute walking trials around an indoor 98-foot course. Participants first walked normally, then were shown a video of the skit and told to copy the walks as closely as possible, with Gaesser and his team measuring how much energy they exerted and the calories they burned. Amazingly, the team found that a silly-style walk actually counts as vigorous exercise — and can burn 100 calories more than if walked for the same time but in a regular style. “I’m a big fan of Monty Python … and, of course, the ‘Ministry of Silly Walks’ was one of my favorite skits,” Gaesser told CNN. “Anyone who’s seen the video knows that, wow, that looks like pretty good physical activity. “My colleagues and I got this idea — basically, wouldn’t it be fun to see how energetically costly those silly walks actually were? How many calories do they burn?” he said of the trial. So next time you go on a “hot girl walk,” you may want to swap the “hot” for “silly” — and see if it makes a difference.
