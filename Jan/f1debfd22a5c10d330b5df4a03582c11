She’s gonna need turpentine to wipe her face clean of all that makeup. Kim Kardashian, 42, jumped on the “British chav” trend on TikTok with a heavily made up face. The SKIMS mogul took to the TikTok account she shares with her 9-year-old daughter North, the eldest of her four children, to try out the over-the-top look. In the post, Kardashian paints on thick, dramatic brows and a layer of foundation to achieve a tan-orangey skin tone that makes Donald Trump’s carrot coloring look subtle. Then she swipes on lots of white under eye concealer, only blends it in halfway, and finishes off the look with a bold matte, nearly white lip. The sex tape star complements the makeup with a messy bun and dramatic gum snapping. On TikTok, the hashtag #britishchav has over 438 million views. Chav is a slang term that comes from the Romany word, “chavi” which means child and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2004. It’s a slang term for someone — often from the lower class — who dresses in a flashy, unsophisticated manner and behaves like a hooligan. Some believe it to be an acronym for “council housed and violent,” referring to those who live in British public housing While many are decrying Kardashian’s look as “hilarious,” some have said it’s “classist.” The extreme makeover has garnered 2.6 million likes on TikTok.
