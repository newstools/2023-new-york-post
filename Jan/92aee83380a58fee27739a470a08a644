He’s all twerk and no play. Channing Tatum believes he’s a better stripper than J.Lo. In a Vanity Fair lie detector test video, Tatum, 42, proposed a strip-off to “Hustlers” actress Jennifer Lopez, 53. “Am I a better stripper than her? I’m gonna say yeah,” the “Magic Mike” actor confessed. “I would go harder. If I was stripping against her, I’m just saying. I would take it to J.Lo’s front door,” he added. The lie detector showed Tatum was telling the truth. “You’ve got to go hard if you’re going to go against the J.Lo,” he continued. “The love, she’s like, man, I don’t know if I’m going to win, but I like my chances, depending on who the audience is,” he said. Tatum has played Magic Mike in the franchise inspired by his real-life time as a stripper in Tampa, Florida, since 2012 — but almost turned down the third movie due to the harsh diet to prepare for filming, which he says required having to “starve” himself. Lopez played a stripper in the 2019 true-crime movie “Hustlers,” for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe. The “21 Jump Street” actor also shared that he “unfortunately” never scammed anyone like Lopez’s characters did in Hustlers. “We made like 60 bucks a night if that, 100 bucks on a good night,” Tatum said. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” the third and final installment of “Magic Mike,” is set to hit theaters on Feb. 10, 2023. Salma Hayek Pinault, Ayub Khan-Din, Gavin Spokes, Caitlin Gerard, Juliette Motamed, Jemelia George and Vicki Pepperdine also star in the film.
