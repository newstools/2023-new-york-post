Meghan Markle was banned from Balmoral by King Charles as Queen Elizabeth lay dying last year, Prince Harry confirmed in his bombshell new memoir, “Spare.” Harry quickly defended Markle, telling his dad, “Don’t ever speak about my wife that way,” according to reports on the tome, which was accidentally released early in Spain. “Charles told Harry that it wasn’t right or appropriate for Meghan to be in Balmoral at such a deeply sad time,’ a source said, according to the Daily Mail. ‘It was pointed out to him that Kate [Middleton] was not going and that the numbers really should be limited to the very closest family.” Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, were in London in September when the Queen’s health rapidly went downhill at Balmoral, her home in Scotland. Many of the senior royals immediately began planning to fly to Balmoral, including Prince William, along with Andrew, Edward, and his wife Sophie, the Daily Mail reported Saturday. About 90 minutes after Buckingham Palace announced the Queen’s ill health, a rep for Harry and Meghan said they both would be traveling to Scotland — but hours later, a clarification was made that Harry would be going it alone. Harry says in his book that during that window of time, he was told by his father not to bring Meghan. Harry then flew by private jet to Scotland and arrived after the Queen had already died. In addition, Harry writes in “Spare” that he learned of the Queen’s death after checking the BBC news website.
