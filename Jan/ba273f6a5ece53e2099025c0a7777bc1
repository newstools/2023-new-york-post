The Eagles’ biggest supporters were ready for game day. Ahead of Sunday’s 2023 NFC Championship game against the 49ers in Philadelphia, the significant others of Eagles players took to their Instagram Stories to give fans a peek at their pre-game activities. The Eagles went on to dominate the 49ers, 31-7, to reach Super Bowl 2023. “NFC Championship!!!!” Jennifer Slay, the wife of Pro Bowl cornerback Darius Slay, shared in an Instagram Story as she modeled her game-day look, which consisted of a black Eagles jacket, distressed jeans, and a football-shaped clutch. Elsewhere on Instagram, Brooke Kuhlman, the fiancée of guard Landon Dickerson, posted a photo of the athlete making his way through the tunnel inside Lincoln Financial Field. “Lets go!” Kuhlman exclaimed. Meanwhile, Katya Suh, the wife of defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, uploaded a series of snaps from the stadium and field, where she modeled a black Common Ground vest and black leggings that she paired with green and white sneakers and Prada sunglasses. “Fly Eagles Fly,” she captioned her Instagram post. San Francisco got off to a nightmarish start Sunday when their rookie quarterback, Brock Purdy, suffered an elbow injury, paving the way for fourth-string quarterback Josh Johnson to enter the game. Johnson then suffered a concussion, and Purdy was forced to return, but Purdy threw just four passes all game. The 49ers also fell behind early when head coach Kyle Shanahan failed to challenge an Eagles’ fourth-down catch by Devonta Smith, which led to Philadelphia striking first with a 6-yard touchdown from running back Miles Sanders.
