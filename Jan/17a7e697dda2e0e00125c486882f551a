The Mets’ pursuit of a fourth outfielder continues without Andrew McCutchen, who is heading back to Pittsburgh as a free agent on a one-year deal. Tommy Pham is another free-agent outfielder the Mets are considering, according to The Post’s Jon Heyman. Pham, who turns 35 in March, is coming off a down season split between Cincinnati and Boston, finishing with an OPS of .686, the lowest of his career other than a miserable 2020 season. The Mets have also discussed the possibility of adding Trey Mancini, who played for manager Buck Showalter in Baltimore. Mancini, 30, missed the 2020 season recovering from colon cancer before returning in 2021. He was traded from Baltimore to Houston in the middle of last year and struggled in the second half with the Astros. Beyond that, the pickings are slim on the free-agent market, with Adam Duvall and Jurickson Profar available, as well as Tyler Naquin, who was a disappointment with the Mets after arriving in a midseason trade from the Reds. The Mets acquired minor league outfielder Luis De La Cruz from the Orioles on Friday to complete the trade that sent catcher James McCann to Baltimore last month. The 20-year-old De La Cruz, who was signed out of the Dominican Republic, spent last season with the Orioles Dominican Summer League team.
