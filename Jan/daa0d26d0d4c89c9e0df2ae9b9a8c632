If you’re looking to unwind after the holidays, and if you have lots of money to spare, an island in the Bahamas is offering the opportunity to rent it all out. Musha Cay, located in the Exuma Chain in the southern Bahamas — a tropical oasis of white sand beaches, crystal-clear waters and palm trees — has five separate homes to choose from. Prices vary based on season, but Airbnb rates currently cost a cool $50,000 per night. So, if fortune is on your side, options for the five homes include a 10,000-square-foot mansion, a five-bedroom house, a beach house, a pier house and a guest villa. Another smaller option is a one-bedroom, one-bathroom spread. Across all properties, there are 12 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms. It’s all part of Copperfield Bay, which is made up of 11 private islands across 700 acres. Each home on the island is designed with a mixture of English colonial-style architecture and tropical island elegance. Features include high ceilings, bright colors and crown moldings. Amenities include access to a speedboat, paddle boarding equipment, a tennis court, several bikes and a spa. Musha Cay also offers a main activity center, which includes a central dining room, a bar, a lounge and a view dock. The island has 30 staff members: daily housekeepers, cooks, butlers, gardeners and a boatman among them. And if it gets too isolated, you can take a one-hour flight to the tourist-destination island of Nassau.
