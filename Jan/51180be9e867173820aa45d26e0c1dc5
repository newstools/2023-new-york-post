It’s the perfect day. After a long, invigorating hike with your partner, you find yourself high up on a seaside trail, overlooking a beautiful vista. There are flowers and balloons. As you turn to take in the view, your lover gets down on one knee. You turn around, gasp, and before you can speak, he flips open a small case, and says: “Will you make me the happiest man in the world and enjoy bestselling, high-quality wireless headphones for reasonable prices with me?” Yes, yes, 1,000 times yes! Whether AirPods are your Valentine’s Day dream come true, or you’re looking to utilize their noise-cancelling technology to block out all of the over-zealous couples come Feb. 14th, we’ve got you covered. By now, AirPods seem to be a part of the basic fabric of life, as essential to people’s uniforms as their pants, and Apple has taken notice, and the prices keep dropping. Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals on Apple AirPods that we could find in 2023, from standard AirPods to Apple’s newest creation, the over-ear Apple AirPods Max. Read on, take a peek at these great deals, and get listening. Apple’s newest model of in-ear headphones, the 2nd Generation AirPods Pro with wireless charging case, have all the same features and capabilities as the previous generation, plus many more. With richer audio experience, next-level noise cancellation, and more intuitive controls, Apple truly stepped up their game with their 2nd Generation. For about $40 less, Best Buy has a Refurbished pair of 2nd Generation Apple AirPods Pro with wireless charging case for just $200. The reviews are in – go ahead and check out hundreds of customer reviews out through the link below – and the verdict is: they’re as good as new. The 1st Generation Apple AirPod Pros have up to 4.5 hours of listening time on one charge and over 24 hours of battery life using the charging case, making them ideal to travel with and use on the go. They’re also noise-canceling and have a transparency mode option if you’re using them outside and want to let sounds come through while you’re working from home or out and about. Plus, they’re water and sweat-resistant. The Apple AirPods Max, which came out in Dec. 2020, are the brand’s first over-ear headphones. These headphones feature spatial sound, giving you a three-dimensional listening experience from music, TV shows, movies, podcasts and more — immersing you in sounds from every direction. The idea is to give the user a theater-like experience so you can feel like you’re in your very own concert hall. You can also enjoy active noise cancelling, transparency mode and adaptive EQ, which means the headphones will effectively tailor the sound coming out of them based on the shape of your ear. The AirPods Max give up to 20 hours of listening time on a single charge (it only takes 5 minutes of charging to get around 1.5 hours of audio!) and they’re available in five different colors. A cheaper option for the same quality as brand-new AirPods, these Refurbished Apple AirPods Max are a cool $50 off of the current going price for AirPods Max off the rack at B&H Photo. If you’ve never bought refurbished, don’t fret. B&H promises that their Refurbished models are as good as new, with “no signs of wear,” visible or otherwise. We know, we know: we’re cheating a little bit here. This is a story about AirPod deals, and these aren’t technically AirPods, they’re EarPods, which just means they’re wired and a whole lot cheaper. This season, EarPods are making a surprising comeback as a viral favorite on TikTok. The nostalgia hits you fast! Go figure. For that reason, and because of the price, we couldn’t resist adding these sturdy, reliable headphones to our list. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
