All quiet on the Tom Brady front. Brady appeared on his weekly SiriusXM podcast, “Let’s Go!” with Jim Gray, and was asked if he has a timetable as to when he will decide whether he will retire or return for a 24th NFL season. “Jim, if I knew what I was going to f–king do, I’d have already f–king done it,” Brady, once again an NFL free agent, said. “I’m taking it a day at a time.” Gray pleaded that it was the question that everyone wanted to hear. Brady was undeterred. “You’re scratching. I appreciate your asking. Thank you,” he said. The Buccaneers finished 8-9, but won the NFC South for the second consecutive year and earned their third straight playoff berth. Brady struggled in the team’s first-round playoff loss to the Cowboys last Monday night, throwing for just 5.3 yards per attempt and throwing a rough red-zone interception in the first half. Tampa Bay fired offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich after the Brady-quarterbacked unit generally failed to have cohesive production this season. Last offseason, Brady briefly retired before ultimately deciding to come back this past season. He turns 46 in August. Should Brady decide to return to the NFL and leave Tampa Bay, there are a number of destinations that would make sense, including the Raiders (a reunion with Josh McDaniels), Patriots (where a return was speculated about in November) and Dolphins (who have tried to woo him for years and even got caught tampering). Several of his former Patriots teammates have weighed in, with Rob Gronkowski saying he can’t see Brady retiring just yet and Julian Edelman saying there’s no way his longtime QB returns to the Bucs. “Let me tell you, it’s going to be whatever situation intrigues him the most,” Gronkowski said. “Whatever opportunity makes him the most excited to play the game of football, that’s where he will be next year.” During this past season, Brady and model Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce after 13 years of marriage.
