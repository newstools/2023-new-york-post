Don’t call us — wheel call you. Four job-seekers in England endured the most nerve-wracking interview of their lives in December while hurtling around a racetrack in a BMW clocking speeds of 110 miles per hour. The quartet vied for a sales executive position at a Big Motoring World car dealership — and they were taken for a joy ride at the famous Cadwell Park in Lincolnshire by popular YouTuber Sid North. In the hilarious video, the suited-and-booted candidates pile into the back of a black BMW M5 Competition, where they were strapped in next to a recruiter peppering them with questions for at least two laps. All the while, North tried to beat his best lap time. He succeeded, clocking in at 1:48.26, besting his previous time of 1:54.13. “One of the most important attributes of an ideal candidate is their ability to perform under pressure,” Big Motoring World sales director Ben Goodwin told Kennedy News. Some hopefuls appeared to relish the adrenaline rush, though a few swearwords were flung about. North was fond of drifting corners at 70 miles per hour. “I feel I’m going to throw up,” one queasy candidate complained. “Why are we going a second time?” another protested. One prospective salesperson even said she was left “shaking” after the ordeal. Luckily for the fearless foursome, the company’s director, Graeme Mitchell, was so impressed by their abilities that he hired the whole group. “Everyone had a chance to prove themselves in a challenging environment, something we hope will help in their new roles,” Goodwin explained. “We’re pleased to say they all passed with flying colors.”
