Casa Lever, part of thriving Sant Ambroeus Hospitality Group, renewed its lease long-term at Lever House, the landmarked office tower at 390 Park Ave. The news was cheered by Casa Lever regulars who were horrified when the Milanese-inspired eatery closed in December. But the shutdown was only to prepare for a planned, early summer reopening following an extensive redesign indoors and out. It’s part of an ongoing, $100 million redevelopment of the tower by owners Brookfield Properties and WatermanClark LLC. On the sad-news restaurant front, Ruth’s Chris Steak House will close after a long run at 148 W. 51st St. on April 30, according to the New York State Department of Labor. The so-called WARN notice said the shutdown is due to a lease expiration.
