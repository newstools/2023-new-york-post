A Mexican model is speaking out about being dumped by her fiancé after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Lucero Vega, 24, has not disclosed the name of her heartless hubby-to-be, who reportedly ended the long-term romance just two months after the devastating diagnosis. “I felt an emptiness at first because I saw a family with him,” Vega told NeedToKnow.Online, saying she’s now auctioning off her wedding dress to raise money for her cancer treatment. The brown-eyed beauty — who has lost her hair since starting chemotherapy — said her partner was initially supportive in the wake of the shock cancer news. “I went to freeze my eggs with him because he really wanted a family by his side,” she stated, before claiming her soon-to-be-spouse suddenly had a change of heart. To make matters worse, Vega learned that her dad had been diagnosed with skin cancer around the time of the breakup. The model was forced to start cancer treatments on her own and has been struggling through harrowing chemotherapy sessions while nursing a broken heart. However, despite being dumped, Vega says she carries no ill will towards her ex and wishes him nothing but the best. On Dec. 23, Vega completed her eighth and final round of chemotherapy, but her health battle is far from over. She still has to have surgery and radiotherapy, which will set her back a considerable sum of money. In order to fund the pricey treatments, Vega has decided to hold a raffle, which will involve auctioning off the bridal dress she planned to wear on her wedding day. There are 500 raffle tickets up for grabs, each costing 500 Mexican pesos (USD $26). Vega is also auctioning off a 2001 VW Golf with 350 raffle tickets available at the same price. “What people have to understand is that with cancer, it is a very long process,” she stated. “I will be receiving treatment for approximately five years.”
