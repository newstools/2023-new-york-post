Former Ryder Cup player and five-times European Tour winner Barry Lane has died at the age of 62 after a short illness, the DP World Tour said in a statement on Sunday. Lane made 693 starts on the European Tour, which is now known as the DP World Tour, and is fourth on the Tour’s all-time appearance list. “We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Barry Lane,” European Tour CEO Keith Pelley said. “To have seen such a level of success across both the European Tour and the now Legends Tour shows his dedication to the game of golf and he was a much-loved figure on both tours. The renaming of the Legends Tour’s Rookie of the Year trophy in his honor is a fitting tribute, and I’m delighted he had the opportunity to present it in December.” He won the Scottish Open in 1988 by three strokes at Gleneagles. Lane’s final victory came at the 2004 British Masters — more than a decade after he had previously claimed tournament.“ Barry Lane was a prince of a guy. He will be missed. RIP,” tweeted fellow British player and two-time major champion Tony Jacklin. The Englishman also played at the 1993 Ryder Cup, where Team Europe were defeated by the United States at The Belfry. “RIP barry – sweetest guy to the very end and coming all the way to Mauritius a few weeks ago, despite very ill health, to say goodbye to all his Tour family says a lot to his bravery & to the close kinship & friendships we all form on Tour,” Irish golf veteran Paul McGinley tweeted. — With Reuters
