The trade to acquire Donovan Mitchell already looks like a success as he leads Cleveland in scoring almost every night. Add in exciting point guard Darius Garland and promising big man Evan Mobley and the Cavs have the look of a contender for years to come. It’s not a three-man show, either. Jarrett Allen is a rebounding force in the post, Caris LeVert can always light it up, and Cedi Osman, Lamar Stevens, Dean Wade and Kevin Love all do their part well. The Cavaliers host the Phoenix Suns tomorrow night in what should be an awesome game. Get in on the action with the FanDuel promo code! OHIO GO-LIVE CODE 21+.
