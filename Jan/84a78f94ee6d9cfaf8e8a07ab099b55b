Live high above the rat race in this twee little slice of country in the heart of New York City. Indeed, a Wes Anderson-worthy dwelling on top of a luxury Manhattan building has hit the market for $2.5 million. From the outside, Madison Parq looks like the stock image of a large pre-war Manhattan apartment building, complete with an awning in front of its entrance and a brick facade. Less stock image is this unit, which is more of an independent abode that so happens to be perched on the roof of the 13-story, 134-unit structure. “The penthouse at 66 Madison presents a rare opportunity to own a secluded, top floor, ‘free standing’ home with unparalleled outdoor space in one of Manhattan’s most coveted neighborhoods,” reads the unit’s listing, which is held by Compass agent Henry Hershkowitz. The one-bedroom, two-bathroom property — which the listing notes is “more like a house on top of a building” than an apartment — spans approximately 1,100 square feet inside, not including an additional 700 square feet of additional private outdoor space on its sprawling terrace. The unit was built out of the Beaux Arts building’s original rooftop machine room, and the ceilings throughout the home are slanted — giving something of a farmhouse-in-the-big-city energy to the space. (The building was originally built in 1918 as a hotel.) In addition to its unique location, the cozy domicile also boasts 12-foot cathedral ceilings in the great room and bedroom, natural oak flooring, direct entry into the unit’s windowed landing from the keyed elevator and a woodburning fireplace. The kitchen is decorated with Calacatta quartz counters and a ceramic tile backsplash, plus a farm sink and custom cabinets. The single bedroom has two closets and an ensuite bath with a Toto commode, and black and white tile. There are six skylights — two in the bedroom and four in the main room — complete with original decorative cast-iron grate coverings, according to the listing.
