That’s one way to get your rocks off. A Florida woman claimed a crack pipe found “protruding” from her vagina during a strip search was actually a sex toy. Carmela Ann Maines, 57, was taken into custody Wednesday in Clearwater, Fla., after she failed to show up to court to face shoplifting charges, according to court records obtained by the Smoking Gun. But while Maines was being processed at the Pinellas County Jail, a body scan revealed an “anomaly” in her genital area, an arrest affidavit said, according to the outlet. When officials conducted a strip search of the suspect, they found that “a glass crack pipe was protruding from the defendant’s vagina,” officers wrote. Maine then allegedly removed the contraband from her cavity and “intentionally threw it on the ground and steeped [sic] on it in an effort to destroy evidence,” the affidavit read. She then “tried to explain” that the object was actually a sex toy, despite the fact that it was “consistent with a pipe commonly used to smoke crack cocaine” and covered with “burnt markings,” police wrote. Maines was charged with possessing contraband in a county detention facility and tampering with evidence in connection with the incident, according to the report. She was held behind bars after failing to post a $3,500 bond, the outlet said. Maines had been reportedly previously been convicted of trespassing, disorderly conduct, fraud, battery, driving without a license and failure to show up in court.
