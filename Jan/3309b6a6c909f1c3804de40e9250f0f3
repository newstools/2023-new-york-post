Some people are afraid of spiders. Others fear cursing on a hot mic. Veteran Fox Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews revealed that dropping an F-bomb on-air is a “massive fear” of hers. During a recent episode of her “Calm Down” podcast with fellow Fox Sports host Charissa Thompson, the pair answered questions from fans, including: “How do you keep from dropping an F-bomb during a game?” “It’s a massive fear — massive, massive,” Andrews said, which sparked a surprised reaction from Thompson. “Really? I don’t even think about it on-air,” Thompson said. “That’s so interesting though. I say that now and I’ll probably do it.” Thompson then asked, “Have you ever done it on accident?” Andrews replied: “Oh my God, no. I am knocking on everything.” Andrews will be on the sidelines for Fox at State Farm Stadium in Arizona for Super Bowl 2023 on Feb. 12. On Monday, she took to Instagram to share that she has started to prepare for the big game. “And so it begins,” Andrews wrote over a photo of her re-watching the Chiefs-Bengals AFC Championship game, adding that hashtag, “Super Bowl prep.” Andrews “quietly” re-signed with Fox on a three-year deal after her longtime colleagues, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, left the network for ESPN last offseason. The Post’s Andrew Marchand first reported in February that Aikman was expected to leave Fox Sports, and Buck later followed to keep the partnership intact for “Monday Night Football.”
