She’s here! Robert Griffin III announced the birth of his third child with wife Grete Griffin on Tuesday, daughter Gia, roughly three weeks after the ESPN analyst bolted from a College Football Playoff broadcast, believing Grete was in labor. “Gia Griffin,” Grete gushed of the new arrival on Instagram. “2023 off to an incredible start.” The Griffins’ new year got off to a wild start when the former NFL quarterback, 32, took a phone call on the sidelines during ESPN’s coverage of the Fiesta Bowl and announced, “I gotta go … My wife is going into labor!” Hours later, however, Grete took to her Instagram Stories to confirm that she was still pregnant. “Take number two: Dropping Robert off at the airport to go to another bowl game. Hopefully this time, baby will stay in… She wanted to make a dramatic entrance to 2023 but decided not to, so, we’ll see how it goes this time around,” Grete said at the time. Grete, a fitness enthusiast, also remarked in a separate message, “False alarm people.” She later posted a tribute to Griffin following the ordeal. “Let’s talk about my husband @rgiii,” Grete began on Instagram. “I gave him a call in the middle of him being on live TV fully expecting to not get a hold of him but I guess when your wife is 9 months pregnant and calls you you answer the phone no matter what you’re doing huh? All I had to say was the word ‘labor’ and this man STOPPED CALLING A BOWL GAME and took off sprinting to the car to get to the airport and get on a 4 hour flight to make it home.” The Griffins revealed in August they were expecting a baby girl. The couple, who has been married since 2018, is proud parents to daughters Gloria, 5, and Gameya, 3. Griffin is also a dad to a daughter named Reese from a previous relationship.
