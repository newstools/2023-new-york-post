Kanye West has tied the knot with Yeezy designer Bianca Censori in a secret ceremony Thursday, according to reports. The rapper was spotted wearing a wedding band on his ring finger, though it doesn’t appear the pair filed a marriage certificate to make the union legally binding, TMZ reports. Censori, who was spotted dining out with the rapper earlier this week, has worked as an architectural designer for his Yeezy brand for a handful of years, her LinkedIn profile revealed. While she’s usually a brunette, she recently changed her look to blond locks — sparking confusion among the “Jesus Walks” rapper’s fans. The pair were spotted with their new rings as they arrived at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills Thursday. Last month, the rapper released a song titled “Censori Overload” — a direct nod to his apparent new bride. The Post has reached out to Ye’s reps for comment. The surprise wedding comes just two months after Ye finalized his divorce from Kim Kardashian. The multi-Grammy winner has stayed mostly under the radar since unleashing several anti-Semitic tirades last year. West’s career spiraled after he tweeted in October that he wanted to go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.” After he was met with backlash, he continued to defend his comments and doubled down on anti-Semitic tropes. West was already on thin ice just days before the social media tirades when he showcased “White Lives Matter” T-shirts at his Paris Fashion Week show. And he hasn’t just been losing out on business. West has also been axed from his ex-wife’s life. Kardashian has shared that she wants to hide West’s many controversies from their four children: North, 9, Saint, 7, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 3.
