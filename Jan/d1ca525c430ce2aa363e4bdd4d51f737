This is a different kettle of fish. A pet fish did some online shopping and shared its owner’s credit card information while playing a video game, according to reports. Japanese YouTuber Mutekimaru, aka Maurice, runs a channel that features his Siamese fighting fish, or betta, playing Pokémon video games on a Nintendo Switch gaming console. A malfunction during a recent game of Pokémon Violet, however, returned the device to its home screen. Due to movements the fish made, the fish was able to open the Nintendo eShop on the screen and spend $4 of Maurice’s money to purchase points. The spendthrift pet also exposed its owner’s credit card information on a livestream. And he didn’t stop there. The fish went on to somehow download an app, spend reward money on a new avatar and ask the online payment company PayPal for a confirmation email. The little swimmer also managed to change Maurice’s account name from “Mutekimaru” to “ROWAWAWAWA.” Mutekimaru’s channel first caught the attention of gamers in the summer of 2020 by featuring videos of betta fish in video game competitions. Their tank is divided into different sections that are designated as the Left, Right, Up, Down, A and B buttons of a game controller. To capture the animals’ movements, a webcam is set up nearby. During play sessions, a total of four fish rotate every 12 hours to allow each to get some much-needed time to recharge. In 2020, one of the fish made headlines when it dethroned the reigning Pokémon Sapphire champion after more than 3,000 hours of continuous playtime. Another was able to uncover a game glitch that humans hadn’t discovered in 18 years.
