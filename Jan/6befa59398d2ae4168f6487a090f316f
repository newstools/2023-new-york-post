Sports betting is officially live in Ohio and New York Post readers can grab a great offer from BetMGM on launch day. Let’s review how you can claim your $1,000 in first bet insurance for Ohio sports betting and preview the legendary Cotton Bowl. New BetMGM bettors in the state of Ohio can claim a $1,000 first bet insurance bet on January 1st. That’s right, your first bet placed can be fully refunded if it loses for up to $1,000 The famous Cotton Bowl will have two very interesting participants as the AAC champions Tulane will take on Heisman winner Caleb Williams and his USC Trojans. However, one big note is that Williams suffered a hamstring injury in the Pac-12 championship. HIs status is up in the air and it will dictate the markets for this matchup. Looking at this matchup, it will be interesting which offensive style shapes the tempo. Tulane could slow the game down by establishing the run while USC can make it a track meet with their vertical passing attack. With the total set at 62, it appears the oddsmakers are expecting both offenses to have success, but the spread is a different story. USC, who barely missed the College Football Playoff is just a one-point favorite. 21+. NY, CO, DC, IA, IN, MI, NJ, NV, PA, TN, WV, IA, VA, WV, and WY only. T&Cs apply.
