Giants coach Brian Daboll’s aggressiveness has paid off for the Giants many times this season, but it backfired in the first quarter in Saturday night’s NFC divisional clash against the Eagles in Philadelphia. After the Eagles jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on their opening drive. the Giants strung together a couple of first downs on their first possession to cross into the Eagles’ territory. The Giants had reached the 35-yard line and were in a third-and-three situation when Daniel Jones was sacked by Eagles star linebacker Haason Reddick for a 5-yard loss, creating a fourth-and-eight at the 40-yard line. Rather than punting, Daboll decided to roll the dice and go for it. But it backfired as Jones was sacked by Reddick again for an 8-yard loss, giving the ball back to the Eagles on their own 48. Jalen Hurts promptly led the Eagles, who would lead 28-0 at the half, on an eight-play, 52-yard drive that took a little over four minutes. He later capped it off through a 9-yard touchdown pass to Devonta Smith to give Philadelphia a 14-0 lead late in the first quarter. Boston Scott added a rushing score in the second quarter to push the advantage to 21-0. Things went from bad to worse on the Giants’ next possession as Jones threw an interception that was picked off by former Big Blue cornerback James Bradberry.It ended a disastrous first quarter for Daboll and the Giants.
