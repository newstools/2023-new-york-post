Tracy Morgan held nothing back when he trolled Eddie Murphy at the 2023 Golden Globes on Tuesday. The “30 Rock” star joked that Murphy’s “pullout game is weak” while presenting him with the Cecil B. DeMille award. Morgan roasted Murphy for having 10 kids with five different women. Paulette McNeely, a former girlfriend, is the mother of his oldest child, Eric Murphy. Nicole Mitchell is the mother of five of his children: Bria, Myles, Shayne, Zola and Bella. Mitchell and Murphy were married from 1993 to 2006. He also shares Christian, 32, with ex Tamara Hood; Angel, 15, with ex Melanie “Mel B” Brown; and Izzy, 6, and Max, 4, with fiancée Paige Butcher. “I know you’re trying to break Bob Marley’s record. You look at Paige, and you get her pregnant,” Morgan said of Butcher. “I am so blessed with my kids,” Murphy told People in 2021. He continued: “I don’t have one bad seed. I don’t have any like ‘Oh you are the one.’ I don’t have any of that. My kids are so great, normal people — and nobody is like the Hollywood jerk kid.” Murphy thanked his children for all of their “love and support” in his acceptance speech at the Globes. He also joked about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars last year while revealing his blueprint for success. “Pay your taxes, mind your business, and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of your (expletive deleted) mouth!” he declared.
