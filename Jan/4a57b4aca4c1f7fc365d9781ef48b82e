Chelsea Handler didn’t hold back in her opening monologue at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards on Sunday evening. The 47-year-old comedian teased Prince Harry and his recent memoir, “Spare.” “Niecy Nash Betts is nominated for ‘Dahmer.’ ‘Dahmer’ became the third highest-viewed show on Netflix, with a combined watch time of 1 billion hours,” the former “Chelsea Lately” host quipped. “Which, apparently, is the same amount of time we’re going to have to listen to Prince Harry talk about his frostbitten penis. Enough already,” she went on. The ceremony gathered the hottest stars in Hollywood on Jan. 15 at the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles and was broadcast on the CW. It was a night of unexpected twists with several stars making unanticipated statements in their award-acceptance speeches. “The Whale” star Brendan Fraser received the best actor trophy and accepted it on stage in an emotional speech. The 54-year-old thanked his fans and joked about the lack of hype for his 2010 comedy “Furry Vengeance.” “This movie, ‘The Whale,’ is about love. It’s about redemption. It’s about finding the light in a dark place, and I’m so lucky to have worked with an ensemble that’s incredible,” Fraser said. Jennifer Coolidge scored the award for best supporting actress in a drama series last night for her role in “The White Lotus.” “I know you’ve heard a lot from me in the last month or two, but I just want to say this is such an honor,” the 61-year-old comedic icon said when she won, referring to her previous win at the 2023 Golden Globes. “This is really kind of as good as it gets, the critics. Not from just the East and the West Coast on the East Coast but all over the country.” “I just want to say thank you. I want to say to all the people out there, for all the people who have sort of given up hope, I hope this gives you inspiration,” the “A Cinderella Story” star added. “It’s all over till it’s over. It’s not over till you’re dead. So please, thank you. Thank you so much.” As for presenter Seth Rogen, he took to the podium to blast the CW. “I’m not saying the CW is bad. What I will say is that it is the one network to receive zero Critics Choice nominations,” Rogen said. “You are saying it’s bad! We’re on your least favorite network. How did that happen?” “If you were a normal viewer of the CW, this is a startling image to be seeing on your television right now,” he continued. “I might be the first Jew on the CW in history. Soak it in.” Here is the full list of 2023 Critics Choice Awards winners: “Avatar: The Way of Water” “Babylon” “The Banshees of Inisherin” “Elvis” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” *WINNER “The Fabelmans” “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” “RRR” “Tár” “Top Gun: Maverick” “Women Talking” Austin Butler, “Elvis” Tom Cruise, “Top Gun: Maverick” Colin Farrell, “The Banshees of Inisherin” Brendan Fraser, “The Whale” *WINNER Paul Mescal, “Aftersun” Bill Nighy, “Living” Cate Blanchett, “Tár” *WINNER Viola Davis, “The Woman King” Danielle Deadwyler, “Till” Margot Robbie, “Babylon” Michelle Williams, “The Fabelmans” Michelle Yeoh, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Paul Dano, “The Fabelmans” Brendan Gleeson, “The Banshees of Inisherin” Judd Hirsch, “The Fabelmans” Barry Keoghan, “The Banshees of Inisherin” Ke Huy Quan, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” *WINNER Brian Tyree Henry, “Causeway” Angela Bassett, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” *WINNER Jessie Buckley, “Women Talking” Kerry Condon, “The Banshees of Inisherin” Jamie Lee Curtis, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Stephanie Hsu, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Janelle Monáe, “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” Frankie Corio, “Aftersun” Jalyn Hall, “Till” Gabriel LaBelle, “The Fabelmans” *WINNER Bella Ramsey, “Catherine Called Birdy” Banks Repeta, “Armageddon Time” Sadie Sink, “The Whale” “The Banshees of Inisherin” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” “The Fabelmans” “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” *WINNER “The Woman King” “Women Talking” James Cameron, “Avatar: The Way of Water” Damien Chazelle, “Babylon” Todd Field, “Tár” Baz Luhrmann, “Elvis” Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” *WINNER Martin McDonagh, “The Banshees of Inisherin” Sarah Polley, “Women Talking” Gina Prince-Bythewood, “The Woman King” S.
