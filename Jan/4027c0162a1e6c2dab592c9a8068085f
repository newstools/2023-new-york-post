The Margot Robbie meme has reached the New York Giants. For some reason, the Oscar-nominated actress is being linked to various athletes in an apparent social media spoof. On Friday, random tweets citing unverified TMZ reports about Robbie dating MLB, NHL and NFL players went viral. On Sunday, Giants wide receiver Darius Slayton responded to a tweet by @DanielJonesMVP that claimed his teammate and fellow wideout Isaiah Hodgins is dating Robbie. The tweet cited TMZ, who did not report the news. “Per TMZ, New York Giants star Isaiah Hodgins is dating A-List actress Margot Robbie,” the tweet read. “1. This post is cap but more importantly 2. Ide chop both his legs off before i let him get to date Margot before me,” Slayton replied in a quote-tweet. Hodgins has not yet publicly addressed the situation. Other viral tweets linked Robbie to Yankees pitcher Wandy Peralta, Bears quarterback Justin Fields, Blue Jays pitcher Mitch White, and Red Sox star catcher Reese McGuire, among others. There is no evidence of TMZ reports linking Robbie to the various athletes. Robbie has yet to address the social media buzz. Earlier this week, the “Babylon” actress received a separate shoutout from Greek tennis player Stefanos Tsitsipas at the 2023 Australian Open. Following his quarterfinal win over the Czech Republic’s Jiri Lehecka Tuesday, Tsitsipas said: “I mean, Australia’s such a great country. I like a lot of Aussie things, you know, one of my favorite actresses comes from Australia, Margot Robbie. “It would be nice to see her over there one day,” Tsitsipas added while pointing towards the seats. Robbie is married to British actor/producer Tom Ackerley, whom she began dating in 2014. The two tied the knot in her native Australia in 2016.
