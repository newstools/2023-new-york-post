A fitness influencer has revealed how she doesn’t watch pornography — but there is one thing that gets her going in the bedroom. Steph Claire Smith opened up the conversation about pornography with her “Keep It Cleaner” co-founder and KICPOD co-host Laura Henshaw in the podcast’s most recent episode. “I have a question for you — do you like porn,” she asked Henshaw, to which the brunette laughed and said she was indifferent. The mother of one then said she doesn’t watch porn, and has nothing against people who do, but it doesn’t excite her in the slightest. But she has been reading Colleen Hoover’s “Ugly Love,” which has had an impact on her sex life. “As I was reading this novel, I realized that this is my kind of porn. It did some things to me,” she told Henshaw. “Basically, what happened, I was reading this book in bed with Josh and he’s like trying to give me the eyes that he wanted to [have sex]. “And I was looking at him like no, no, no, this book is way too good, and I was right in the middle of one of those chapters.” Henshaw then interjected to point out that instead of having sex with her husband, Steph was imagining herself in the book. “I know,” Smith laughed back. “I kept reading and, I was reading the page, I was so excited about it that I put the book down and did the deed.” “He was like, ‘Wow, what book are you reading?’” She then read a raunchy excerpt from the book to make her point. The conversation was posted to Instagram with the caption: “Ok I did not expect this question or what followed it @stephclairesmith. Are books anyone else’s thing or is it just Steph?” Hundreds of social media users shared their feelings on the matter. “Yesssssss, felt the same way reading the first chapter of Layla by Colleen Hoover. And this is now next on my list,” one person said. Fellow influencer Mitch Orval said: “Finally I understand why Colleen Hoover is all over my news feed.” Another said that it was just what Hoover did to people.
