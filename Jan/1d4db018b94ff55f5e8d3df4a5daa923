The early indications are that Ben Simmons has avoided the worst. Simmons exited the Nets’ loss to the Pistons on Thursday night in the second half with what was termed as soreness in his left knee. He is questionable for Saturday’s Barclays Center matchup with the Knicks, the Nets said Friday, which is relatively good news. Leaving the door open for his return without missing a game is positive for the team and for Simmons, who has missed 11 games this season due to injury, several of which have involved his left knee. Simmons exited a Nov. 28 win over the Magic (the second game of a back-to-back) with a sore knee. Simmons played 28:42 in a loss Wednesday at Philadelphia before logging 19:47 Thursday. It was unclear whether Simmons felt the soreness on a specific play. He appeared to take a shot to the face from Detroit’s Jaden Ivey before heading to the locker room in the third quarter. “The goal is … for everyone to play every game and to do what’s necessary to be prepared to play every game,” head coach Jacque Vaughn said when asked about health concerns with Simmons when playing consecutive days. “You just have to give credit to the guys who were prepared to play, ready to play, did what was necessary to get their bodies ready to play.” Simmons left the game scoreless, going 0-for-3 from the field, but had seven assists. He has struggled to take on a larger role in the offense in the eight games Kevin Durant has missed since he sprained his right MCL. Simmons has driven infrequently and often has settled for hook shots when he has found himself in the paint. Since Durant’s injury, Simmons has averaged six points, 5.9 rebounds and 8.3 assists while the Nets have lost six of the eight games.
