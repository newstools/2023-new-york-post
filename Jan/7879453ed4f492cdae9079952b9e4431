Nick Sirianni isn’t joking around, no matter what the score. The Eagles’ head coach sounded off on a referee at the tail-end of Saturday’s 28-0 first-half thrashing against the Giants. Philadelphia, which had just scored its fourth touchdown of the first half with a Jalen Hurts run, looked to capitalize even further by showing they were going for a two-point conversion. Warning Adult Language With the play clock running down, the Eagles called a timeout and cameras panned to Sirianni screaming at a referee while walking away from the end zone’s sideline. The irate coach could be seen saying, “I know what the f–k I’m doing, and I’m allowed to be down here.” The Eagles then opted for an extra point, which grew their lead to 28-0. The Eagles have dominated the Giants, who finally managed to score a touchdown in the middle of the third quarter to cut Philadelphia’s lead to 28-7. Big Blue lost possessions early on after a costly gamble called by Giants head coach Brian Daboll, who tried to convert on a fourth-and-eight at the Eagles 40-yard line in the first quarter. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones struggled mightily in the first half, throwing for just 57 yards and a pick.
