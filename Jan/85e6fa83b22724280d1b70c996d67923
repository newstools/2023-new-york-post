After as emotional a week as the Buffalo Bills could have, their entire stadium became unglued after their first play since Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field last Monday. Nyheim Hines of the Bills returned the opening kickoff against the Patriots 96 yards for a touchdown, sending everyone at Highmark Stadium into a frenzy with Hamlin watching the game from his hospital in Cincinnati. “OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Hamlin wrote on Twitter after Hines’ touchdown. “FREE HINES.” Right before the game, Hamlin tweeted a photo of himself in his hospital bed making a heart gesture with his hands while wearing a “Love for Damar” T-shirt. Hamlin, 24, went into cardiac arrest against the Bengals and had to be resuscitated on the field. He has made gradual progress throughout the week, ultimately coming off a breathing tube and communicating with his family, friends, and teammates. Bills players were all wearing Hamlin shirts before the game, as were many fans in the parking lots prior to kickoff. Some Bills players ran out to the field with “Pray for Damar” flags. “GameDay.. Nothing I Want More Than To Be Running Out That Tunnel With My Brothers. God Using Me In A Different Way Today. Tell Someone You Love Them Today!” Hamlin wrote on Twitter before the game. “Let’s go @BuffaloBills.”
