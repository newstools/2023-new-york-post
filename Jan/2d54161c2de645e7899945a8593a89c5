Jeremy Renner shared that he’s home from the hospital after the snowplow accident that left him in critical condition. In a reply to a tweet about the Season 2 premiere of his Paramount+ show “Mayor of Kingstown,” Renner wrote: “Outside my brain fog in recovery, I was very excited to watch episode 201 with my family at home.” The revelation comes soon after the actor revealed that he was feeling homesick. On Thursday, he posted photos of his Nevada home to his Instagram Stories, writing: “Missing my happy place.” The Marvel actor has been hospitalized since Jan. 1 after “experiencing a weather-related accident while plowing snow” and suffering “extensive” injuries in Lake Tahoe. Renner was attempting to remove a car from being stuck in the snow when the Kässbohrer PistenBully snowplow ended up running him over. Renner recently celebrated his 52nd birthday in the ICU, reposting a video to his Instagram Stories from the Base Chicago, a youth organization with which he appears to regularly volunteer, with a tribute for him. It was reported that his injuries were “worse than anyone knows” and could take two years to fully heal. The actor was airlifted to a hospital near Reno after a neighbor who happened to be a doctor applied a tourniquet to his leg to stop the bleeding. The two-time Oscar nominee was transferred to the intensive care unit following surgeries he was required to undergo following the incident.
