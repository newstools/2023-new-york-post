It’s a mystery why some fine lefty relievers Andrew Chafin, Matt Moore, Brad Hand and Zack Britton are still looking for jobs. “Strange,” one executive called the remaining market glut. Michael Wacha and Zack Greinke are the top two starting pitchers still free. Wacha is seeking a two-year deal. Greinke has been negotiating with his old Royals team all winter. There are still some starting-caliber shortstops left — including Elvis Andrus and Jose Iglesias. In the outfield there’s Jurickson Profar and David Peralta. The Twins are viewing Carlos Correa’s deal as a 10-year, $270 million deal, at least for now (though we know it’s $200M that’s guaranteed for six). … The Twins, with a late rush, had a terrific winter. The infield prospect acquired with Pablo Lopez in the Luis Arraez trade — Jose Salas — has great hitting potential and “off the charts makeup.” The Twins checked in with Yuli Gurriel and might be interested on a very low deal. The Marlins were said to have made a low offer but things seemed to have cooled there. Astros people like him, so a return can’t be ruled out. The Marlins are moving folks all around the field to get more offense. Jean Segura, a longtime 2B, will play 3B, Joey Wendle, a 3B, will play SS, and Jazz Chisholm, a 2B, will play CF. That’s to start, anyway. Some wonder if Segura will wind up at SS (his original position) and Wendle goes back to 3B. Enrique Hernandez will be the main SS for the Red Sox. And like Chisholm, Hernandez is gung-ho about the switch, Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom told us on The Post podcast “The Show.” Though the Angels sale talks were going well, word is the Nationals’ situation is “a mess,” thanks to the unresolved MASN issue. Ted Leonsis, a partner of the Lerners on the Capitals and Wizards, is one of the few interested parties out there.
