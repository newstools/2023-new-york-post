A Brooklyn man who bludgeoned an Asian woman to death will spend the next two decades behind bars, prosecutors announced Tuesday. Elisaul Perez was hit with the 20-year prison sentence after he attacked 61-year-old GuiYing Ma with a rock as she swept a sidewalk in her Corona neighborhood in November 2021, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office. The 33-year-old admitted to the heartless crime last month when he pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Queens Supreme Court. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said she hopes the sentence provided “some measure of solace” for the victim’s family. “The long sentence will hold the defendant to account for an unprovoked attack that robbed a community of a beloved member,” Katz said in a statement. Perez picked up a large rock and hit Ma in the head, causing her to fall on Nov. 26, 2021, the district attorney’s office said. While on the ground, he struck her again with the rock, prosecutors said. The violent attack was caught on camera, the district attorney’s office said. Ma was rushed to the hospital and underwent emergency surgery for severe head trauma and brain injuries. But she died from her injuries about three months later at Elmhurst Hospital. After Perez gets out of prison, he will have five years of post-release supervision.
