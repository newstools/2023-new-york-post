An Arizona woman faces 43 charges of animal cruelty after complaints of animal hoarding at two different homes led police to discover the residences were covered in urine, feces and trash, police said. The Mohave County Sheriff’s Office Animal Enforcement Division investigated animal hoarding at two different residences in Dolan Springs, both of which were utilized by 77-year-old Betty Lynn Fuchsel. The department also received complaints that the animals ran around at large and attacked livestock in the area. The sheriff’s office said in a press release that Fuchsel received several citations for the violations and failed to appear in court or comply, ultimately leading to her being taken into custody on Jan. 11. Following her arrest, the Sheriff’s office secured and executed search warrants for both of Fuchsel’s residences. When deputies entered both premises, they reported seeing the floors covered with feces, trash and urine. Police said several dogs were locked up inside the residence and in vehicles on the property without access to food or water. In total, the sheriff’s office seized 43 dogs, which were emaciated and in different stages of neglect. Many dogs were taken to receive emergency veterinarian care, while all animals were handed over to the Mohave County Animal Shelter. Fuchsel was charged with 43 counts of felony animal cruelty.
