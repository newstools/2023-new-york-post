If Valentine’s Day yesterday wasn’t enough of a blow, it’s going to cost you a pretty penny to be by your lonesome in the Big Apple. New York City has been marked as the most expensive place to live as a single person, according to a new study by the real estate firm Zillow. The heartbreaking truth, the study says, is that singles pay on average $19,500 more across all boroughs a year for a one-bedroom, compared to someone living with a partner in the same area. In Manhattan, this figure rises even higher, to $24,000 — making it the priciest borough. San Francisco, which has also long been known as a high-price city, comes in second with a $14,000 “singles tax” for a one-bedroom apartment. Meanwhile, partners who live together in New York City will save an average $39,000 per year. Across all US cities, Detroit and Cleveland are labeled as having the lowest singles tax at $4,483 and $4,387. “Living alone has its perks — you never have to share a bathroom, you have a claim to the TV at all times, and dirty dishes can stack up as long as you want, judgment free. But all that freedom comes with a cost,” Amanda Pendleton, Zillow home trends expert, says in the report. “Even though rent prices are starting to cool, they are still significantly higher than they were a year ago. Renters considering going solo this year must decide how valuable living alone is to them, and if the cost is worth it.” Nationally, singles pay nearly $7,000 extra per year for a median one-bedroom apartment.
