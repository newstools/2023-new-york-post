NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” scored an interview with the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down by the US over the Atlantic Ocean. Bowen Yang played the deflated bag of gas, who was swatting away seagulls in the ocean after falling from great heights. Well, you got me. Congrats, you shot a balloon,” Yang told MSNBC’s Katy Tur, played by Chloe Fineman. “I entertain you people for four days and then get shot by Biden? I can’t believe I’m Joe’s Osama,” Yang said. “Everyone’s being surveilled constantly, but it’s always ‘shoot the balloon!,’ never ‘unplug Alexa,'” he complained. A Pentagon official and aviation expert played by Kenan Thompson — armed with a small party balloon as a prop — stopped by the newscast to gravely discuss the popping mission. “The balloon was somehow able to get past our West Coast anti-balloon defense system: the Seattle Space Needle,” Thompson said. “Once it was here, we were able to keep an eye on it with our sophisticated tracking technology of going like this,” Thompson deadpanned as he tilted his head upwards. The story was revisited on “Weekend Update,” as anchor Colin Jost cracked that the whole ordeal was history’s most complicated gender reveal party. “And bad news for China, it’s a girl,” he joked, alluding to the country’s longtime one-child policy, that resulted in mass infanticide. Host Pedro Pascal gave a big shout out to his native Chile, but asked his 34 first cousins that still live there to stop sharing his phone number with strangers. Musical guest Coldplay and Jacob Collier performed a mashup of their songs “Human Heart” and “Fix You.” The band also played “The Astronaut,” backed by the Jason Max Ferdinand Singers choir. The show was set to return to the airwaves on Feb. 25 with host Woody Harrelson and musical guest Jack White.
