There’s nothing worse than dull. A dull movie, and you’ll fall asleep. A dull class, and you’ll fall asleep. A dull kitchen knife, and you just might fall asleep trying to chop an onion, though it’s more likely you’ll get so frustrated you decide to order take-out. Save your Grubhub budget this month for a rainier day, and get back to home-cooked meals with this Zwilling Twin Signature 3-Piece German Knife Set, now on sale on Amazon. There really is nothing like refreshing your kitchen knives to get you excited about cooking again. And with this set from Zwilling, you may just regain so much enthusiasm that you’ll have half a mind to become a professional chef. Zwilling knives are crafted in a company-owned German warehouse with a unique Zwilling-family steel formula, ensuring a razor-sharp first, second, third, and 200th cut. Even with minimal care, Zwilling ensures that your knife set will stay sharper, longer. Better yet, this week on Amazon, Zwilling slashed the price of this 3-Piece knife set by 26%, bringing the total down to just $140. Das ist cool! The Zwilling Twin Signature 3-Piece German Knife Set includes a 4-inch paring knife, a handy 6-inch utility knife, and a large, 8-inch chef’s knife, all for just $140, down from a $188 list price. Most home chefs can make anything only using these three knives. Zwilling’s special steel formula, combined with their patented ice-hardening technique, means you won’t have to buy another knife set for a long time (unless, of course, you love these so much you just have to gift them.)
