Patrick Mahomes might be in the dog house with his wife, Brittany Matthews. The Chiefs quarterback admitted that he forgot about Valentine’s Day as he prepares to play in Super Bowl 2023 against the Eagles on Sunday. Mahomes, who tied the knot with Brittany in Hawaii last March, appeared caught off guard when he was asked about the holiday while speaking to reporters on radio row in Arizona. “I didn’t even notice it was coming up, so don’t tell her I said that but I’ll make sure I have some plans now,” Mahomes said. “I don’t know when it is, I know it’s February 14, but I don’t know what day of the week [it is]. I’ll make sure to make plans. I appreciate you reminding me.” Last year, Brittany shared photos of the couple posing together with the caption, “My forever Valentine.” They celebrated daughter Sterling Skye’s first birthday a few days later on Feb. 20. Mahomes and Brittany — who welcomed their son, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III in November — have a lot to celebrate. Their daughter’s second birthday is later this month, followed by their first wedding anniversary in March. It’s understandable that Valentine’s Day would slip Mahomes’ mind as he is just days away from playing in his third Super Bowl. The 27-year-old quarterback is also recovering from a high-ankle sprain he sustained in the Chiefs’ Divisional Round victory over the Jaguars. Mahomes played through the injury to lead Kansas City to a 23-20 win over the Bengals in the AFC Championship game on Jan. 29. “It’s definitely better,” Mahomes said Monday about the injury. “You never know exactly until you get to the game obviously, but it’s definitely in a better position than it was at this time before the last game. We’ll keep pushing it but not doing too much ’cause you don’t want to have any setbacks, but I haven’t had any since the game at least.” The Chiefs and Eagles face off in Super Bowl 2023 in Arizona on Sunday.
