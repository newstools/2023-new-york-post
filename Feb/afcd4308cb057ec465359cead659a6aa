The first potential Derek Carr suitor is on the board. The Saints have been granted permission to be the first team to talk with the Raiders quarterback, according to multiple reports. He will visit with them on Wednesday. According to NFL Insider Albert Breer, New Orleans getting to talk to the 31-yeard-old signal caller means it and Las Vegas have agreed on trade compensation. The question now will be can the Saints and Carr agree on a contract. While anything is possible, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Carr – who has a no-trade clause – is just doing his due diligence and a trade is no imminent. The Raiders do have a Feb. 14 trigger date when $40.5 million of his salary becomes guaranteed. The hit would either need to be absorbed by the Raider or the team Carr is traded to. Las Vegas also could cut him to avoid the hit, but then not be able to get anything back in as their cap hit would still be $5.6 million. A fast-moving market for Carr is not ideal for teams – such as the Jets – who are expected to have interest in acquiring Aaron Rodgers from the Packers. Rodgers said Tuesday on “The Pat McAfee Show” that he plans to spend four days in a “darkness retreat” coming up in a couple weeks to help him decide his NFL future. Teams who have Carr as a potential backup plan could be left empty-handed if he makes a decision soon. Carr, who was taken in the second round by the Raiders in the 2014 draft, just finished up his ninth year with the franchise and holds just a 63-79 record overall with just two playoff appearances. After making the postseason in 2021, Las Vegas was a disappointing 6-11 under first-year coach Josh McDaniels. The franchise is finally ready to move on from Carr, who completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards, 24 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. New Orleans in is need of a quarterback after going 7-10 with a mix a Jameis Winston and Andy Dalton under center.
