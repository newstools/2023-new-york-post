Diane Keaton is spreading the love for Valentine’s Day with a steamy video. Keaton, 77, posted a video montage of her making out with a variety of male co-stars from different movies she has starred in throughout her career. “HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY TO ALL THE MEN WHO WERE PAID TO KISS ME,” she captioned the post. The “Annie Hall” star included hot and heavy kissing scenes with actors Michael Douglas, Keanu Reeves and Jack Nicholson. Iconic rom-com filmmaker Nancy Meyers, 73, commented on the post, saying it was “hilarious.” “But as someone who was around for a few of those – those guys always wanted one more take,” Meyers, who directed Keaton in “Something’s Gotta Give” and three other movies, quipped. In August, Keaton shared some of her memories from her early career and revealed that Al Pacino, 82, was not supposed to be in “The Godfather.” “Nobody wanted Al Pacino. They didn’t want him to play that part, and I had already been cast,” Keaton told “Entertainment Tonight” at the time. “I had been cast before Al Pacino in ‘Godfather 1’! Is this not weird?” Keaton was present for Pacino’s second audition for the iconic 1972 movie, and he ultimately got the job — and later received an Academy Award nomination for his role. “I was standing there and they brought him up when I was standing there and we worked together in front of [the producers], and they gave him the job,” she shared. “Do you believe that? After he had auditioned before and they didn’t want him.” “What would ‘The Godfather’ have been without Al Pacino?” Keaton added. “It’s just one of those weird, unusual things in life.”
