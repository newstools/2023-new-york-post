One of the NFL’s top linebackers is unexpectedly hitting the open market. Bobby Wagner and the Los Angeles Rams mutually agreed to part ways, according to a report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter on Thursday, making the nine-time Pro Bowler a free agent. The Rams were reportedly looking to create more cap space ahead of the offseason while Wagner was looking to join a winning team, per Schefter. Wagner won’t be able to sign with teams until the new league year, which begins on Mar. 15, NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported. Wagner immediately becomes one of the best available free agent defensive players and is expected to garner significant interest. The 32-year-old led Los Angeles with 140 tackles, including six sacks and two interceptions in 2022, making the All-Pro second team. Wagner played in all 17 games and was Pro Football Focus’ top-rated linebacker. While Wagner played well, the 2022 season was one the Rams would like to forget. Coming off a Super Bowl victory against the Bengals, Los Angeles finished third in the NFC West with a 5-12 record, in part thanks to injuries to key players like wide receiver Cooper Kupp and quarterback Matthew Stafford. Drafted by the Seahawks 47th overall in 2012, Wagner earned his first and only Super Bowl victory with the team following their win over the Broncos in Feb. 2014. Seattle cut Wagner in March 2022 after ten years with the team. Later that month, Wagner signed a $50 million deal worth up to $65 million with the Rams. After one disastrous season, the two parties will head separate ways.
