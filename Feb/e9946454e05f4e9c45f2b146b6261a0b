James Clapper just can’t tell the truth. The onetime National Intelligence chief is blaming the media over the now-infamous October 2020 letter suggesting Hunter Biden’s laptop was a Russian fake. Who waits 28 months to set the record straight? “Politico deliberately distorted what we said,” mewls Clapper on behalf of all 51 intel community “experts” who signed the missive. Bull. The letter got read exactly as they intended. Clapper et al. claimed, with zero proof but plenty of weasel words, that the device had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” And anyone with the media experience of these “experts” would’ve expected Politico to then firmly declare the laptop “disinfo.” The signers wanted the “laptop is disinformation” narrative to bloom, and so protect Joe Biden in the 2020 race. Now that Hunter’s lawyers have blown up the disinfo claims by admitting the laptop was his (as was obvious from the start), the slimy spooks’ only way out is playing the victim. Cue widespread fury. Plainly, if Politico “distorted” their letter, Clapper & Co. had a duty to speak up then. Especially as the “distortion” was amplified by other high-profile Dems such as Jen Psaki, Susan Rice and prez candidate Joe Biden. They didn’t. Nor did they “clarify” when The Post followed up in March 2022 after other outlets grudgingly “authenticated” our reporting. “I stand by the statement made AT THE TIME,” was what Clapper said. Most of the other 50 didn’t respond at all. Indeed, we’ve reached out for comment countless times, never to hear any “distorted” complaints. This years-belated walkback reeks of desperation, as the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees demand interviews with Clapper and other signers. Make them testify under oath, we say — and, since Clapper has lied to Congress before, watch out for perjury.
