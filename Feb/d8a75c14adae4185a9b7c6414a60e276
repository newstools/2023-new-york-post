The Kyrie Irving melodrama is finally over, the Nets trading the talented but troublesome star to Dallas. Brooklyn will bring back former Nets fan favorite Spencer Dinwiddie, as well as Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected 2029 first-round selection as well as 2027 and 2029 second-round picks. The news was first reported by the Athletic and confirmed by The Post. Irving is averaging 27.1 points, 5.3 assists and 5.1 rebounds, but had seen his relationship with Brooklyn break down over the past two years. He missed two-thirds of last season due to his refusal to adhere to New York’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates and was suspended eight games without pay this season for promoting an anti-Semitic movie. Irving demanded a trade on Friday, and Sunday morning a source confirmed to the Post he was considering sitting out the entire rest of the season if not dealt by Thursday’s 3 p.m. NBA trade deadline. In the end, Nets owner Joe Tsai and general manager Sean Marks didn’t leave it that late. The Lakers had tried to get involved due to mutual interest with Irving and prodding from LeBron James. But Brooklyn preferred to get a plug-and-play point guard and a wing along with picks, all of which they got from Dallas. They brought back Dinwiddie, who spent five seasons in Brooklyn. The 29-year old guard is averaging 17.7 points, 5.3 assists as Luka Doncic’s running mate. His shooting splits are .455/.405/.821, and now he slots into the backcourt alongside Ben Simmons to give the Nets’ a long-armed pair of disruptors. Dinwiddie is earning $20 million this season and $21 million next year. Dorian Finney-Smith is a 6-foot-7, 220-pounder who can play both forward spots. He’s making $12.4 million this season, and inked a three-year extension in February. Dallas coach Jason Kidd wanted to pursue Irving, and the star guard also has a long history with Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who was a Nike exec.
