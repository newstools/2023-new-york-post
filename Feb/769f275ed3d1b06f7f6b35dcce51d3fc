Was it going to be Adele? Was it going to be Harry Styles? Or was it going to be the ever-elusive Beyoncé opening the 65th annual Grammy Awards at Crypto.com Arena — the first time the show has been held in LA since COVID shut the world down? In fact, the primo placement went to Puerto Rican sensation Bad Bunny, who made history with “Un Verano Sin Ti,” the first Spanish-language LP to be nominated for Album of the Year. And now, he’s making Grammys’ history with what might be the most full-throttle all-Spanish opening extravaganza ever. Kicking off his medley of “El Apagon” and “Despues De La Playa,” Bad Bunny, 28, brought the fiesta through the audience — no social distancing in 2023! — Bad Bunny made up for his no-show at last November’s American Music Awards, where he was the top nominee. While he could have gone a little harder on wardrobe — his white t-shirt and jeans made him look like he was still in rehearsals — he got the party started after a semi-slow start. His festive, if somewhat chaotic performance got Taylor Swift, Jack Harlow and even 93-year-old Motown founder Berry Gordy out of their seats. Bad Bunny has previously won two Grammy Awards and four Latin Grammy Awards. This year he’s been nominated for Album of the Year, Best Música Urbana Album and Best Pop Solo Performance.
