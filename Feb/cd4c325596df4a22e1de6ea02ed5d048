This model is serving post-pregnancy realness, but her followers are in disbelief. Model Kendal Schuler showed off her toned physique Sunday — just six days after giving birth to her second child. “Day 6 with Friday Fallon,” reads the Instagram post showing the Aussie mother in a black bikini and baseball hat while holding her newborn. Schuler said she named her daughter Friday after a character in Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel “Robinson Crusoe.” The 32-year-old model made headlines in 2011 while dating “Titanic” star Leonardo DiCaprio following his split from Blake Lively. Schuler and the “Great Gatsby” star split in 2017. In a previous Instagram post, Schuler revealed her baby was 10 days overdue and thanks to her late arrival, she now shares a birthday with her mama. “SHES FINALLY HERE. 10 days overdue. Shares a birthday with her Mum. She is perfection. FRIDAY FALLON WILLIMENT,” reads the caption. While many fans congratulated her on her new addition, many were astonished to see her post-baby body snap back just days after giving birth. “What a babe!!!” gushed one user. “Show off,” joked another, to which Schuler responded: “just loving my new t-ts! Thanks Friday.” Another person commented that breastfeeding does “wonders to that supermodel bod of yours,” prompting Schuler to declare: “I LOVE BREAST FEEDING.”
