What’s the first thing that comes to mind when we say “Dyson V12 Detect Slim“? “Powerful”? “Lightweight”? “Sleek”? “Easy-to-use”? “Well-designed”? “Free shipping”? “Two year warranty”? “Intelligently-optimized suction”? “Equipped with the latest hair-detangling technology”? We’d accept all of those answers, because all of them happen to apply to the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. The one we were looking for, however, was: “$100 off for a limited time.” Level up your vacuum game ahead of spring cleaning with the state-of-the-art Dyson V12 Detect Slim stick vacuum series, now just $550 from the Dyson site. All three of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim models, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim Absolute, and the Dyson V12 Detect Slim Extra, are $100 off on the Dyson store. Each just $550. Described as Dyson’s “most lightweight intelligent cordless vacuum,” the V12 Detect Slim Extra is capable of handling every mess, big and small. And with front-attached laser illumination designed to pick out microscopic dust, we mean even really, really small messes. There’s still time to get the gift that will make your hubby swoon this Valentine’s Day, and they don’t ever have to know you saved $100 on it. This Dyson V12 Detect Slim Extra colorway – Prussian Blue and Copper – is only available from Dyson, but then again, so is this sale. Save $100, and snag this exclusive, limited-edition Dyson, alongside three additional tools (the extension hose, the awkward gap tool, and the scratch-free dusting brush), totaling a $125 value, thrown in for free. Put bluntly: this deal doesn’t suck. Act now, and get yourself the vacuum of the future, today, for less. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
