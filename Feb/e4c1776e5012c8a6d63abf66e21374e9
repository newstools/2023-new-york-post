For the second time in the last week, a bettor placed a seven-figure bet on Super Bowl 57. And it shouldn’t surprise anyone which side it’s on. One ambitious bettor placed a $1.25 million wager on the Eagles moneyline (-125) at BetMGM on Thursday – the second bettor to back the ‘Birds with a million-dollar bet in the last five days. No matter which team or players you are cheering for, Caesars Sportsbook has you covered for all of your Super Bowl 57 bets! The ticket would pay out $1 million if Philadelphia takes care of business against the Chiefs in Sunday’s big game: If you’ve been following the money since this matchup was set after the conference championships, you won’t be surprised to see Philly drawing the first two seven-figure wagers of the Super Bowl. Sharps were all over the Eagles when this game opened at pick ‘em, betting the NFC champions as high as -2.5 before the line settled at -1.5 at most shops for much of this week. We’ve seen some buyback on the Chiefs over the last week, with one Kansas-based bettor placing separate wagers of $150,000 at Caesars Sportsbook on Kansas City to win outright (+105) and cover the spread (+1.5). Another bettor laid $314,000 on Patrick Mahomes and company to cover an alternate spread of +3.5 (-157) with a payout of $200,000 if it cashes. Still, based on the early activity we saw on the Eagles, it’s likely that we’ll see at least one or two more sizable wagers on the favorites before kickoff. Of the first 24 bets of at least $10,000 at Caesars, 21 of them were on Philadelphia, which has since drawn the two largest wagers of Super Bowl 57 and figures to be a popular side for big-money bettors in the final days before Sunday’s game.
