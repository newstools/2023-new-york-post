Former President Donald Trump took aim at pop star Rihanna ahead of her highly anticipated Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday. “Without her ‘Stylist’ she’d be NOTHING. Bad everything, and NO TALENT!” Trump fumed on Truth Social. The dig against the 34-year-old artist came after Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), who was Trump’s former White House doctor, had earlier posted on the platform that the NFL should yank Rihanna from the half-time show line-up for spray painting “F— Trump” on a car at the Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas, in 2020. Rihanna tweeted images of her handiwork at the time, captioning it “art.” “She’s made a career of spewing degenerate filth while badmouthing America every chance she gets. Why is the NFL showcasing this crap?” Jackson griped. Rihanna hasn’t been shy about blasting her disdain for Trump. In 2018 she ripped Trump’s rallies as being “tragic.” Soon after, her publishing company barred the then-president from playing her songs at his political gatherings. A year later, she told Vogue that Trump was “the most mentally ill human being in America.” Rihanna will take the stage for the first time in seven years at Super Bowl LVII in Glendale, Arizona. The singer is expected to play many of her greatest hits, and changed her setlist at least 39 times leading up to the show.
