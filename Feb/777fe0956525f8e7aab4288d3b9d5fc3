Impending free agent Jordan Poyer has got the future — and his bottom line — on his mind. When discussing free agency this past week on his self-titled podcast, the 31-year-old Bills safety expressed what he’s looking for should the next stop of his NFL career be outside of Buffalo. “A lot of people ask me, ‘Oh, if it wasn’t Buffalo, where would you go?’ I kind of ponder the question every once in a while. I would love to go to a state that doesn’t take half of my money,” Poyer said. “… Taxes play a big part in all of our lives, especially at the level we play at. You look at some of your checks and some places you go take half of your check away. You are wondering where is that money even going.” The Pro Bowler, who originally signed a four-year, $13 million deal with the team in 2017 before agreeing to a two-year extension in 2020, added that if not the Bills, he wouldn’t mind competing for a team in a warm-weather locale. “It’d be nice to be warm. It would be nice to see the sun, maybe, every week or so, every other week at least,” Poyer said. The first-team All-Pro defender then floated the possibility of potentially joining Buffalo’s rival: the Miami Dolphins. “It’d be crazy to stay in the [AFC] East and come down here to South Florida,” said Poyer, who had been discussing the upcoming birthday plans for his friend, Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. “I might have to put my best suit on, put a nice little tie on.” Poyer isn’t the only member of his inner circle who has openly discussed free agency possibilities. Back in November, Poyer’s wife, Rachel Bush, was asked by a fan if she could convince her husband to be a member of the Dallas Cowboys. “He knows I wanna live in Texas,” Bush responded in an Instagram Story at the time, adding, “FA [free agent] this year.” Free agency officially opens on March 15 with the beginning of the 2023 NFL league year.
