It’s only natural. As you get older, your teeth get more exposure to the environment. You’ve simply smiled more than an eight-year-old has. Or at least, we hope. You’ve also eaten more food, drank more coffee, have maybe had a glass of wine or two over the years. Such is life. Time goes on, your teeth yellow. As they say in France, “c’est la vie,” which roughly translates (we believe) to something along the lines of “que sera sera.” Why so unbothered, you may ask? Because there are solutions to yellowing teeth. And those solutions are on sale. This week, pick up an Aquasonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush on Amazon for over 40% off.
