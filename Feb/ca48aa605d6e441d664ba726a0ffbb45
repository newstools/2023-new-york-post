Add yet more deaths to the hideous toll inflicted by “progressives” in the law: Carol Siemon, the George Soros-aligned Ingham County prosecutor, let alleged MSU shooter Anthony McRae skate on a 2019 gun felony. Conviction back then would’ve made it illegal for McRae to own a gun even if he wasn’t imprisoned. So Siemon has fresh blood on her hands. The guy she released in the name of “equity” went on to terrorize an entire community with a firearm, killing at least three before taking his own life. And these people claim to be anti-gun violence. Pathetic. Siemon left office at the start of this year amid fury over her soft-on-crime ways, such as her 2021 move to drop all mandatory prison time attached to gun felonies — because, she insisted, such mandatory minimums are “not in any way linked to the goal that we share of keeping the public safe.” We have doubts you do in fact share that goal, ma’am. Indeed, as McRae’s and countless other cases show, such tough rules absolutely are linked to public safety. When soft-on-crime DAs nix harsh punishments altogether, crime goes up. It may not affect them much, as they’re generally among the most privileged people in the US. But for the communities around the country that bear the brunt of rising gun violence, it’s literally a matter of life and death. Even now, the Ingham County prosecutor’s office is mealymouthing the issue, saying that “it is time to address gun violence in this state and the gun laws that allow for it to continue, time and time again.” A disgusting dodge. Public prosecutors have a direct means of fighting to make sure crimes like this don’t happen: refusing to let obvious menaces like McRae off the hook the first time they offend. That they allow gun crime to run wild while babbling lefty pieties makes their dereliction of duty all the uglier.
