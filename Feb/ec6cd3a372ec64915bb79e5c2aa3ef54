Shaun Osher, the co-founder and CEO of Core — a boutique real estate brokerage also co-owned by Related and Midtown Equities — and his spouse, Core’s COO Brittley Wise, have recently plunked down $3.1 million for a landmarked Long Island estate. The Sands Point, NY, property is 5,795 square feet and sits on 2.3 acres. Built in 1893, the property was once a working farm on a 300-acre country estate known as Cockran Barns. The estate was purchased in 1887 by Congressman and lawyer William Bourke Cockran, who held it until 1922. During that time, visitors included President Theodore Roosevelt, and a young Winston Churchill who visited with his mother Jennie, a friend of Cockran’s. Known for his oratorial skills, Cockran was reportedly known as the “silver-tongued orator of Tammany,” according to Betsy Silverstein, who formerly owned the property with her hustband Scott, and wrote about it in a local publication. Churchill even credited Cockran as a model for his own legendary oratorial gifts, according to his memoir, “Amid These Storms.” Vincent Astor later purchased the estate in 1927. The grounds include a new pool and landscaping that boasts one of Long Island’s oldest magnolia trees, and other 100-year-old specimen trees, according to the listing. The sellers bought it for $905,000 in 1996 and first listed it for $3.5 million last February. As for the main house, it has been modernized. There’s also a 700-square-foot former “ice house” and a smokehouse with a kitchenette and a full bath that is currently used as an office. There’s even a large, 2,516-square-foot barn with a loft and three horse stalls that currently operate as a garage — plus a separate chicken coop that also once housed a bull named Weaver. The once-staid neighborhood made the news in 2017, when Adam Sandler and Chris Rock  rented several properties in Sands Point for the summer while filming the Netflix comedy, “The Week Of.” The listing broker is Maggie Keats, of Douglas Elliman.
