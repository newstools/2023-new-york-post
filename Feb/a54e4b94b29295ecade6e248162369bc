It appears the room that is supposed to get you clean may be the dirtiest. Several TikTokers have taken to social media to warn fellow travelers to clean their tubs — before even taking a bath. One TikToker posted a video — which gained 709,000 views — of the visitor bleaching the tub “before even laying a finger on it.” Another user went even further and used a bath liner — or what is called a “tub condom” — in an effort to protect themselves. “A life saver for hotel bathrooms & rentals,” reads the video’s caption. According to microbiologist Philip M. Tierno, even if  the tub looks clean, there is most likely a hidden layer of germs on the surface called “biofilm.” The biofilm is “a nearly undetectable layer of bacteria that sticks to tubs and other surfaces,” the microbiologist told The Sun. A study published in 2012 revealed that nearly 81% of surfaces in a hotel room are covered in residual fecal matter from the previous occupant, however, it was recently discovered that the bathtub is considered to be the dirtiest. This latest find is the most recent of several nasty, dark secrets that hotels don’t tell their customers. One housekeeper came forward in August to reveal several things that people should avoid touching the glassware when spending the night in a hotel. “Usually the housekeeper just rinses these things out in the bathroom sink and dries them off with the same rag that they used to clean the rest of the room with,” explained the housekeeper on TikTok. The employee also warned about using an in-room ice bucket, as sometimes people use it as a water dish for pets and do “much worse things” with them. Another former hotel worker came forward to suggest that occupants should wipe down the TV remote with a Clorox wipe before using it. She also cautioned against immediately jumping into bed without setting aside coverings. “Those bedspreads get cleaned like maybe once a year, so don’t sit on those,” warned the worker.
