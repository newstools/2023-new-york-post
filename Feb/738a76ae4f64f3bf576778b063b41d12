A Brooklyn mother whose son was gunned down on Long Island is pleading for someone in New York City to finally come forward so his killer can be brought to justice after nearly two years. “They never found who killed my son, [the man] who took him away from me,” Marie Rosenthal said in an emotion interview Friday. “I know somebody knows something they just don’t want to talk,” “Please help me,” she pleaded while sobbing on the phone. The woman’s son, Danie Philistin, was fatally shot during a house party in West Babylon on July 17, 2021. Philistin, a 29-year-old Brooklyn native who was living in South Plainfield, NJ, had gone with friends to the party that cops say was packed with people from Queens and Brookyln. At one point, a man there inappropriately touched one of the women in Philistin’s friend group, and he stepped in to try to calm things down, according to police. As people were pushing and arguing — one of the attendees pulled a gun and shot  Philistin. He died at the scene, cops said. Police still don’t have a suspect in the case and are asking any of the attendees to help identify who pulled the trigger. “My son was a good boy. He was good son to me,” Rosenthal said.
