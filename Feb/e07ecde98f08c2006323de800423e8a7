Patrick Mahomes might’ve had one too many Coors Lights at the Chiefs Super Bowl parade in Kansas City on Wednesday. The two-time Super Bowl MVP was captured on video casually handing off the Lombardi Trophy to a fan before he walked away empty-handed. Mahomes, who did remember to hold onto his beer, was posing for a selfie with the fan and seemingly forgot to retrieve the trophy. The short clip showed the Chiefs quarterback leaving the trophy behind after mingling with fans in the street. He then headed towards one of the red busses that drove the team through downtown Kansas City. Mahomes, a security guard or someone from the Chiefs most likely took back the Super Bowl hardware, but talk about a risky move. Other viral videos showed Mahomes throwing back Coors Lights on the roof of one of the team’s busses, which read “World Champions” on the front. At one point, quarterback coach Matt Nagy was seen helping hold him up. The 27-year-old wore a WWE championship belt and rocked a pair of tinted ski goggles during the Super Bowl celebrations. At one point, Chiefs fans cheered him on while he stopped to use a porta-potty on the parade route. Mahomes’ mother Randi was also living her best life at the parade. The proud mom shared a video to Instagram that showed her dancing in the street with “Modern Family” actor Eric Stonestreet. “Dancing with the stars here we come!” Stonestreet, who was decked out in Chiefs gear, wrote in the comments. Mahomes’ wife Brittany Matthews posted a series of Instagram story videos at the parade, where she downed shots with Chiefs WAGs. The KC Current co-owner also shared moments inside the private after-party, which took place at Mosaic nightclub in downtown Kansas City, where the Chiefs and their guests enjoyed VIP bottle service. Mahomes led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in franchise history after defeating the Eagles 38-35 on Sunday.
