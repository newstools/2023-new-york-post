Welcome to the Grapefruit League, Jasson Dominguez. The Yankees’ No. 2 prospect hit a solo home run to right center off Phillies left-hander Ben Bowden during the fifth inning of his first-ever spring training game with the club. Dominguez hit a fastball on the first pitch he saw in the at-bat. Dominguez, who turned 20 earlier this month, is the youngest player in the Yankees’ major league camp. The outfielder grounded out to first base during his first at-bat of the day. The Yankees signed the switch-hitter to a $5.1 million deal when he was an international free agent in 2019. Though he’s not the super-hyped prospect he once was, Dominguez still enters this season as Baseball America’s No. 67 prospect. “He had an exciting year last year,” manager Aaron Boone said this week. “He went from A-ball down here in the Florida State League to High-A then to Double-A. Every step of the way, his plate discipline, his contact quality, all those things went up. He plays a really good center field, athletic, great arm. “We’re excited about him. Last year was a big stepping stone for him, so hopefully, he continues to build on that.” Dominguez had a solid season across three minor league levels last year. Overall, he hit .273 with a .837 OPS and 37 stolen bases in 120 games. There is a chance Dominguez starts the year at Double-A Somerset, which would put him in line to contribute to the Bronx Bombers as early as 2024.
