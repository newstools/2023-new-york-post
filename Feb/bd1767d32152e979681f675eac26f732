A 74-year-old man was killed in a blaze at a Queens home early Friday, officials said. The senior, whose name was not immediately released, was inside the two-story house on 149th Street near 18th Street in Flushing when the fire broke out just before 3 a.m., according to police and the FDNY. He was taken to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. No other injuries were reported. A dozen FDNY units — including 60 firefighters and EMS workers — responded. The fire was placed under control about an hour after it erupted, the FDNY said. Fire marshals will determine the cause of the blaze.
