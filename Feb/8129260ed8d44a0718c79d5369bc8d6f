Two muggers held up a man at knifepoint in downtown Manhattan early on Wednesday — just hours after another New Yorker was stabbed and robbed in the Bronx, police said. The pair of crooks — one of them wielding a knife — came up to the victim walking on Bleecker Street, near MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village around 12:45 a.m., cops said. The duo demanded the man’s belongings and grabbed his bag, which contained his “personal property” and an unspecified amount of cash, authorities said. The suspects fled after the robbery, and the victim was not hurt. Hours earlier, a man was walking on University Avenue near West 183rd Street in University Heights around 9:45 p.m. Tuesday when a creep stabbed him in the shoulder with an “unknown object,” authorities said. The male suspect then snatched a pendant the victim was wearing, but failed to take the chain, cops said. The thief took off, and the victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition, police said. No arrests have been made in either case.
