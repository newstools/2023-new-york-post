Paige Spiranac’s Super Bowl experience got off to a playful start on Tuesday. The golf influencer, who is serving as a special Super Bowl 2023 correspondent for “Inside Edition” in Arizona, took part in a series of drills, according to her Instagram Stories, which included bringing down a tackling dummy. “How it started,” Spiranac remarked as she carried the ball while making her way through hurdles. In a separate action shot, the “Playing A Round” podcast host can be seen jumping on a tackling dummy, to which she responded, “How it ended lol.” Spiranac, 29, posted the second photo on Twitter later in the day Tuesday and quipped, “How men expect me to act when they send d–k pics in the DMs.” The social media sensation, who has been open about the bizarre and explicit messages she’s received from fans over the years, recently spoke to “Inside Edition” about what the opportunity to report from the big game means to her. “It’s going to be my first Super Bowl. I can’t wait, I’m really excited,” said Paige, who added she’s stoked to see Rihanna perform the halftime show. It’s been a busy few weeks for Spiranac, who recently launched her subscription-based website, “OnlyPaige,” in January. Exclusive photos, golf instruction, Q&As, and live streams are among the content subscribers will have access to. “My followers have been asking me forever to join a subscription site and I really love the idea of a subscription program but I wanted to do it in a way that felt comfortable to me and felt authentic,” Spiranac told Forbes in a recent interview. Spiranac believes her site gives fans a little bit of everything that encompasses her world. “We wanted to make this a little different, feel a little more personal and also have the golf content be elevated,” she said.
