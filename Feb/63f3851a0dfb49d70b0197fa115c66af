PORT ST. LUCIE — Ronny Mauricio’s early lead for the Mets in the long-drive category will be difficult to overtake. The rookie shortstop launched an estimated 450-foot homer Sunday at Clover Park as part of the Mets’ 6-3 exhibition victory over the Nationals. The towering blast in the eighth inning landed deep on the berm behind the right-field fence. It was a majestic shot, but not in the category of the 507-foot rocket Mauricio hit last August for Double-A Binghamton at Somerset. “The work that I have been putting in and the effort I have been putting in every day, and to be able to see that and also see the results show on the field, it felt good,” Mauricio said through an interpreter. Mauricio, 21, was in camp last season for the Mets. He said he feels as if he belongs more this year, following his MVP performance in the Dominican Winter League. “I feel really different compared to last year,” Mauricio said. “I have more experience now and I also have more confidence. Just being here, I kind of feel like a big-leaguer already.” Though Francisco Lindor is entrenched at shortstop for the long term, the Mets plan to keep Mauricio at the position in the minors — with an eye toward keeping his trade value the highest. Mauricio indicated third base is the position at which he is next most comfortable. “[Mauricio] has come a long way, kind of evolved as a prospect in a lot of ways,” manager Buck Showalter said. Brandon Nimmo won’t debut in the Grapefruit League until next week, as part of his strength and conditioning plan. Darin Ruf is close to playing in an exhibition game, according to Showalter, as he continues his ramp up after receiving a cortisone shot in his right wrist upon arriving at spring training. Pete Alonso will be among the starters to play Monday on the road against the Cardinals. The first baseman was the lone Mets position player participating in the WBC who wasn’t in Sunday’s lineup.
