Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Tuesday: Clarke Schmidt is working on a new cutter to help against lefties, but he looked just fine against righties Tuesday, striking out Anthony Rizzo, Josh Donaldson and DJ LeMahieu across two simulated innings. Catcher Ben Rortvedt remained sidelined for a second straight day because of a finger injury, which has required him to visit specialists to determine a course of action. Former Giants GM and new Yankees adviser Brian Sabean made an appearance during Tuesday’s workout, holding court in the dugout with fellow adviser Omar Minaya, GM Brian Cashman and assistant GM Michael Fishman. Sabean is well regarded for his scouting and development chops. The Yankees are set to hold their third full-squad workout at Steinbrenner Field, with Gerrit Cole among the pitchers who will face live hitters.
