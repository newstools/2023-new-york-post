Olivia Dunne still hasn’t competed in 2023, as LSU’s star gymnast recovers from an injury, but Katherine, her mother, is still “proud.” In a video on her Instagram story, which Dunne then shared, Katherine posted a video of Dunne conducting a bars routine, with the caption accompanied by a heart emoji. It’s unclear when the video was filmed Friday, since Dunne didn’t participate in LSU’s 197.750-197.500 loss to No. 5 Auburn, but the routine lasted nearly 20 seconds and ended with a successful landing. Despite her ongoing absence, Dunne has continued traveling to meets and posted that it’s a “Great day to be a Tiger” after LSU defeated Georgia last week. Head coach Jay Clark told nola.com on Jan. 30 that Dunne’s stress reaction flared up following the Tigers’ meet against Arkansas, noting that the junior still likely wouldn’t compete for at least two weeks because of that situation that’s “a little bit frustrating.” Dunne had also reportedly noted that she was recovering from a torn labrum in the weeks leading up to the campaign. Still, it has been an eventual start to the 2023 season for Dunne and the Tigers. Unruly fans chanted Dunne’s name outside the Jon M. Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City in a “scary and disturbing and cringey scene,” as former gymnast and current broadcaster Samantha Peszek described the encounter. It prompted Dunne to address fans on social media following the season-opening loss to Utah. “I will always appreciate and love the support from you guys,” Dunne, who has millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram, wrote on Twitter. “But if you come to a meet, I want to ask you to please be respectful of the other gymnasts and the gymnastics community as we are just doing our job.” The university also hired a security guard to accompany the team. LSU’s next meet comes on Friday, when the Tigers (2-5) host No. 2 Florida. Dunne’s status for the event is unclear.
