An elderly American expat couple have been missing in Greece since last month, and their daughter fears they may have died by suicide. David Harrison Robinson, 83, and Lucretia Robinson, 80, were last seen leaving their home in the southwest Peloponnese village of Methoni on Jan. 23, an official Silver Alert issued by Greek authorities states. According to the alert, the couple left home in their electric blue Opel Aglia car “with a possible destination of Monemvasia in Laconia,” and have not been seen or heard from since. They were officially reported missing by relatives earlier this week. It is not clear how the Robinsons came to live in Greece. Photos from Lucretia’s Facebook profile show the duo posing together in elaborate costumes. The couple’s daughter, Julianna Robinson, wrote in a Feb. 5 Facebook post that her parents were “presumed dead of their own volition.” Julianna, who is based in Seattle, declined to elaborate on the tragic situation and said she did not know where her parents went to “end their lives.” “Until their bodies are found, I need the help of my community to stay functional,” she continued. The following day, she shared another post seeking recommendations for a probate lawyer. “The will is very simple and leaves everything to me, but with property in both WA and Greece I want to make sure I’m doing it correctly,” she explained. When reached by social media, Julianna did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
