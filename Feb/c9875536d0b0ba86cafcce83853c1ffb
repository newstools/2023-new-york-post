Courteney Cox will still be there for you — as a “Gen Z girl.” The 58-year-old “Friends” actress featured herself browsing through pictures on Pinterest in a typically hilarious video posted to her Instagram this week. “Look at these Gen-Z girls. So cute. I wanna do that,” she said. The “Scream” queen then shows her getting ready in a trendy outfit while Sam Smith’s “Unholy” plays in the background. Cox then films herself doing her makeup with fox-eye eyeliner and putting her hair in bubble-braid pigtails with two face-framing tendrils. She completed the look with a Gen-Z inspired outfit — a crochet crop top with a mock neckline and several cutouts, paired with low-rise jeans and a dark navy tie-dyed blue hoodie. “Am I slaying this right?” Cox asked in the caption for the video. Cox then started snapping selfies, holding up a peace sign and sticking out her tongue. At the end of the clip, an off-camera man — presumably her longtime boyfriend Johnny McDaid, of the band Snow Patrol — can be heard questioning, “What?” “Oh s–t, he’s home,” Cox said before running out of the video. People loved her transformation, commenting that “on a scale of 1-10, you are definitely 19!” “You actually look great though,” someone said. “Omg!! Seriously how are you over 50?? You look amazing!!!!” a fan commented. “Not you looking hotter than any Gen Z queen!!!” another chimed in. “We need Coco’s reaction to this look. You slay all day,” one person wrote, referring to Cox’s 18-year-old daughter Coco, who she shares with ex-husband actor David Arquette.
