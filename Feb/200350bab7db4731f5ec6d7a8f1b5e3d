Six months after saying “I do” to Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez is saying goodbye to her Bel-Air, California home of six years. Lopez, 53, purchased the extravagant French-style nine-bedroom, 13-bathroom pad for $28 million in 2016. It’s now for sale asking $42.5 million, its listing brokerage told The Post. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the listing. Lopez, long known as a savvy property investor, had already scored a deal at the time of purchase. The home had gone up for sale for $40 million at the time. Pegged as a “rare and extraordinary estate” moments from the Bel-Air Hotel, the home features a living room with a fireplace, high ceilings, a wet bar, and steel windows and doors that open to the stone terraces, the listing notes. The formal dining room and chef’s kitchen with a built-in breakfast area come with a stone fireplace. There’s also a family room and a game room with a bar that opens out to the terrace with views of the three-sided infinity-edge pool. All of the rooms open out to terraces. The lower-level lounge boasts a 30-seat screening room. On the second floor is an office/study, a massage room and a guest room. The primary suite wing comes with a library and siting room, a fireplace and dual dressing rooms that open out to an expansive terrace. There is an additional guest house, a studio, a gym, a 100-seat amphitheater and an organic vegetable garden.
