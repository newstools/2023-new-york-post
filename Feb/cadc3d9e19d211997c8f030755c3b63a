The Wildcat returns for his 26th NFL season in The Post. Including the 1997-2022 seasons in the Bettor’s Guide, Cat’s record in print stands at 624-582 (53.87 percent) against the spread. You could discern from the general ebb and flow of the wagering market — for what on the surface was at least a normal reflection of public confusion regarding what may or may not be the right side — the Chiefs, with their generally glossier roster and longer sustained exposure under the modern public’s eye, gained the bulk of early market attention. Alas, before you could say “Len Dawson,” the broad market took the bit between its teeth and dragged the Eagles into sustained public favoritism. This surprised many, however marginally. The modern Chiefs have been a public team for a longer period of time than has Philadelphia — but the market quickly took Philly seriously again. The Eagles got off to their snappy early-season start and have done little to discourage their loyalists. We’re compelled to grant the Eagles a tangible edge, in meaningful part due to QB Jalen Hurts’ ample motivation to foil his stubborn doubters. The price on the favorite is reasonable, and we’ll bite. No bad luck! Championship weekend: 1-1. Bengals (L), Eagles (W) Season: 19-21-1
