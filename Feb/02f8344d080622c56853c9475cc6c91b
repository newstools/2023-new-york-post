Three NYPD cops were injured when their cruiser slammed into another car as they chased down catalytic converter theft suspects in Queens Friday, cops and sources said. The marked police vehicle was following the alleged car-part crooks’ Infiniti sedan when it crashed into an uninvolved Jeep Cherokee at Jamaica Avenue and 96th Street in Woodhaven around 12:20 a.m., according to cops and the sources. The man behind the wheel of the Jeep refused medical attention, cops said. The three cops inside the police car were taken to New York-Presbyterian Queens Hospital for complaints of pain, police said. They were treated and released. The Infiniti got away and no one was arrested, cops said. It’s unclear whether the Infiniti was uninvolved in the crash.
