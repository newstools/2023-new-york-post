It’s giving divorcée reclaiming her supermodel status. Gisele Bündchen, 42, is campier than ever on the cover of Vogue Italia’s March issue — so much so that some fans think her high-fashion look is verging on drag. On the Brazilian’s first Vogue cover since her high-profile divorce from oft-retired Tom Brady, Bündchen rocks a blood-red über-short ’do with matching ultra-thin red eyebrows, along with dark, graphic eye makeup and a red silk Valentino dress. But the picture made Instagram users do a double take, as Bündchen fans think she looks similar to “RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 5 winner — and Broadway’s latest “Chicago” star — Jinkx Monsoon, 35, who has signature orange-red locks. “You’re telling me that’s not jinx monsoon?” one commenter wrote on Vogue Italia’s post. “What a bold statement to put [Jinkx] Monsoon on the cover of Italian Vogue! Love it!” another sarcastically quipped. “She’s giving @thejinkx,” another echoed, while one more broadly declared, “Looks like a drag queen.” “I totally dislike it. She looks like a drag queen or a demonic creature,” another criticized Bündchen’s look. “This looks cheap for Vogue Italia,” a commenter fired at the mag. But others supported the mom of two’s jaw-dropping transformation. “That’s why she is one of the few modern supermodels,” one fan applauded. “She’s so versatile!!! A chameleon,” another claimed. The Post has contacted representatives for Bündchen, Monsoon and Vogue Italia for comment. In other shots posted Wednesday, Bündchen changes up her look, alternating a short bleach-blond hairstyle, a short black wig and a voluminous orange number. Bündchen and Brady announced their split in October after 13 years of marriage. Both of them have maintained a happy front, as Brady has been spending more time with their kids and Bündchen re-created her 2004 Rio Carnival outfit in Brazil on Monday.
