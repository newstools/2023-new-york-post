As boxing champ Adonis Creed, Michael B. Jordan isn’t scared of anybody. Still, the 36-year-old actor — who will star in his directorial debut, “Creed III,” out March 3 — does have his fears. “I think the fear of being forgotten is a big one,” Jordan told Rolling Stone in the magazine’s new cover story. Jordan went on to explain the very personal reason why he came about this particular fear. “One of my best friends growing up passed away when I was, like, 23,” he said. “And a few years later, I was working, shooting a film, crazy s—t going on at the time, you know, it was like the most amazing amount of stress. And I forgot his birthday.” The Newark, New Jersey native continued, “I didn’t call his family on that day. I didn’t take time during that whole day to remember that it was my best friend’s f—king birthday. His birthday. To pass away, bro. And I felt like the biggest piece of s—t ever. And I felt … f—k … if somebody I hold so dearly, I can forget when their birthday was … what the fuck they gonna do about me?” Jordan also confessed that he’s afraid of leaving this earth while “there’s more to do.” “I have not reached my full potential,” he said. “That’s another fear, not reaching my full potential,” he said. “To go on these solo journey, to be so f—king locked in, to shut out the world and focus on certain things in order to advance or get better or master your craft, you know, you gotta be a little obsessed and a little off.” Jordan admits that he’s not sure if he’ll ever feel accomplished enough in his career. “I’m scared. I’m scared it’ll never happen,” he said. “I don’t know if I want to be in a constant state of building. But I don’t see myself slowing down. Even when I want to slow down — I do, in theory, [it] sounds good. But then, I’m so curious. I want to leave nothing on the table. Life’s short. Like, I don’t want to leave any stone unturned. I want to squeeze every f—king drop out of this.”
