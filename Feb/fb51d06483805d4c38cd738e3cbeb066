Emmy-winning actor Sean Hayes, best known for his hilarious role as Jack McFarland on NBC’s “Will & Grace,” has been spotted house hunting on the Upper East Side. In early December, Hayes toured a $23 million Upper East Side penthouse at the Wales, a historic former hotel converted to condos in Carnegie Hill. It’s a unit that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost also once toured, as Gimme Shelter previously reported. This spring, Hayes will be starring on Broadway in Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Doug Wright’s new play, “Good Night, Oscar.” The full-floor, 4,179-square-foot residence comes with an immense 3,114-square-foot wrap terrace across two levels — and includes an outdoor kitchen complete with a wet bar, a fireplace and a butler’s pantry. The five-bedroom penthouse is new construction built on top of the historic hotel, with interiors by Parisian firm Pinto. The home opens to an entry gallery with a dedicated elevator. It flows into a corner great room with a fireplace, coffered ceilings, corner windows and terrace access via French doors. The building’s lobby boasts coffered ceilings and antique mirrored walls. Before the condo conversion, the hotel was a hot spot for celebs primping before heading over to the Met Gala at the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art.
