The late actress Zsa Zsa Gabor’s hot pink Palm Springs, Califonia estate has hit the market for $3.8 million. The gaudily glamorous property was also home to her sister, Magda Gabor. On an elevated plain perched between mountains in the Little Tuscany area, the socialite sisters separately occupied this flamboyantly decorated compound over the course of 30-plus years. The custom-built abode measures 3,441 square feet and maintains the multi-marriage extravagance that defined Zsa Zsa’s public image. (The Budapest-born star of 1952’s “Moulin Rouge” had just under 10 husbands in her 99 years, the last of which remained her spouse until she passed away in 2016.) Outside, the brick facade is painted like a Barbie Dreamhouse. The large, in-ground, mosaic tile pool has a statue standing over its center and is surrounded by a sprawling stone deck complete with an abundance of black-and-white deck chairs, which match the awning on the deck. There’s also a patio with a fire pit, and a lower level swathed in artificial turf and “desert landscaping,” according to the listing. Inside is no less exuberant. There are stone floors and mirrors galore, a hot pink closet, a hot pink entry, hot pink carpeting, chandeliers aplenty, a kitchen brimming with black cabinets — plus a wine fridge, a warming drawer and an original Hungarian rotisserie — and a yellow peacock-wallpapered bathroom. In all, there are three bathrooms and three bedrooms. The primary bedroom has its own wing complete with an office, a dressing room, a makeup room and an ensuite bath with dual vanities. Those looking for a home full of stories and color have certainly found a contender. Not convinced? Perhaps it’s worth a try anyway, for buying a house is somewhat like marrying a building, and in the words of Zsa Zsa, “A girl must marry for love, and keep on marrying until she finds it.” Conrad Miller and Brandon Holland of Avenue 8 have the listing.
