Bradley Cooper might be a highly-acclaimed actor, but he can’t quite pull off the role of T-Mobile salesperson. The “Silver Linings Playbook” star, 48, appeared in the phone company’s 2023 Super Bowl commercial alongside his mom, Gloria Campano, where he was tasked with selling her a cell phone. However, Cooper couldn’t complete the challenge after being savagely mocked by his sassy mom who delivered a series of spontaneous one-liners. According to Ad Age, the duo was originally meant to stick to a script for the commercial before Campano hilariously began to ad-lib. At one point during the commercial, the mom mocked her famous son because he was clad in a T-Mobile uniform. “Yeah I don’t like the way you look,” she quipped as she stared at Cooper’s hot pink t-shirt. “You look like a flamingo.” In another part of the hilarious ad, Cooper referenced the fact that he is an acclaimed actor. “I think I know what I’m doing,” he stated while trying to sell his mom a phone.  “I’ve been nominated nine times.” “Yeah but you’ve never won anything,” his mom hilariously clapped back, referencing his infamous “loser” status. The commercial marked Cooper’s first time acting in a Super Bowl ad, and fans on Twitter couldn’t get enough. “Bradley Cooper’s mom during the T-Mobile commercial teasing him for not winning an Oscar. l’m losing it,” one person wrote. “Bradley Cooper and his mom win the first quarter with this spot for T-Mobile,” another cheered. And while Cooper couldn’t convince his mom to buy a cellphone from T-Mobile, it appeared he had a different affect on one person viewing the ad at home. “I don’t know if this is a controversial opinion, but I like Bradley Cooper? I find him charming. I am buying a T-Mobile plan as we speak,” they declared.
