He’s back on top. Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regained his title as the richest person in the world Monday after he was stuck in second place the last two months, according to Bloomberg. The eccentric billionaire’s net worth was $187.1 billion after Tesla stock shot up 5.5% Monday afternoon, edging out French businessman Bernard Arnault, whose fortune is at $185.3 billion, the financial outlet reported. After Musk, 51, became the first person to ever lose a jaw dropping $200 billion entering 2023, shares in his electric car company reportedly helped him earn back richest title with about a 70% increase in Tesla stock price this year. Musk, who owns Twitter and SpaceX, lost his wealthiest title in December to Arnault, who owns and runs LVMH, the world’s most massive luxury goods company. He bought Twitter for a stunning $44 billion last year and has since cut more than half of the social media company’s staff, including another 200 employees in recent days.
