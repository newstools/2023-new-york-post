There’s nothing like that new laptop smell. Or, maybe we’re thinking of cars? But there’s still nothing like a new laptop. It’s faster than your old one. It runs apps better. Your messages send faster, and you get replies faster, both of which take on a heightened importance on Valentine’s Day. Consider, for a moment, the worst case scenario: your years-old laptop misses a notification, and you don’t see that your boo made a V-Day dinner reservation. You’re devastated, believing that bae didn’t think of you on February 14th. Bae is devastated, and so is the string quartet he hired to propose to you on the spot at the Italian place where you went on your first date. He’s been there since 7:30. Luckily, this Valentine’s Day, you can avoid that scenario with these great deals on 2021 MacBook Pros on Amazon. Choose between a 512GB MacBook Pro for under $1,500, or a 2021 MacBook with a full terabyte of storage space, available on Amazon today for 20% off, or a $500 discount.
