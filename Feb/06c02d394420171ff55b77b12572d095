Say cheese! When you’re getting your photo snapped, are you showing off all of your pearly whites, or hiding them away in your smile, worried that they might not be quite so pearly, or quite so white, anymore? We hope that you’re comforted in the knowledge that this is not a rare phenomenon. All across the country, (or, the globe!), adults are concerned about yellowing teeth, and they’re looking for solutions. In a recent New York Post Shopping article on the best whitening toothpastes, we spoke with NYC-based dentists for advice, including Lilya Horowitz, DDS, a board-certified dentist at Domino Dental, and Sonya Krasilnikov, DDS, a general dentist at Dental House. Any one of those 9 options is a winner, but we wanted to highlight this deal on Colgate Optic White Pro Series Whitening Toothpaste, which came highly recommended by our panel of dentists, and is currently half off on Amazon.com. Need we say more? As Dr. Krasilnikov said to us in our article last week, some whitening toothpastes contain “abrasive particles,” which might whiten your teeth superficially, but can “damage tooth structure over time.” She recommends Colgate Optic White, however, “because it ranks well on the Toothpaste Abrasive Index and whitens with hydrogen peroxide.” For just $6, never worry about how your smile will show up in pictures again.
