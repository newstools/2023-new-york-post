Furry soothsayer Punxsutawney Phil delivered some bad news early Thursday: six more weeks of winter. The famous prognosticating rodent made the cold prediction when he saw his shadow during the annual Groundhog Day ceremony at Gobbler’s Knob in western Pennsylvania. Phil’s “inner circle” — a group of top-hatted dignitaries who are responsible for planning the annual event and caring for Phil himself — summoned him from his tree stump to make his prediction shortly after 7:20 a.m. ET, with newly elected Gov. Josh Shapiro in attendance. The traditional event in the community about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh grew out of the February 2 holiday of Candlemas in Europe, where Christians would take candles to a church to have them blessed. A popular English folk song declared that winter will have “another flight” if conditions on Candlemas were fair and bright. That interpretation became accepted throughout most of Europe until it reached Germany, where a hedgehog became part of the tradition and a “second winter” would be expected if it saw its shadow on Candlemas. According to records dating back to 1887, Phil has predicted winter 106 times and an early spring 29 times. But the toothy rodent’s track record is not exactly perfect. “On average, Phil has gotten it right 40% of the time over the past 10 years,” the National Centers for Environmental Information said in 2022. Here are his past 10 predictions, as compiled by USA Today: But there’s no shadow of a doubt that his full title is impressive — Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators, and Weather Prophet Extraordinary. Phil may be the most famous forecasting critter, but he also counts New York City’s Staten Island Chuck in his company. Chuck predicted an early spring during an event Thursday at the Staten Island Zoo.
