A parolee with a violent past was arrested after he posted a photo to Instagram that showed him flaunting an untraceable ghost gun, federal prosecutors said. Jihad Smith was driving on the Saw Mill River Parkway Feb. 20 when another driver allegedly spat out of their window while stopped at a traffic light, authorities said. The gross move apparently irked Smith, who started beefing with the spitter and allegedly threatened them with the ghost gun, according to prosecutors. The driver called cops, who caught Smith and his passenger after their car smashed into a guard rail when they tried to flee, according to a Manhattan Federal Court filing. Cops later found the Polymer80 9-millimeter ghost gun, or weapons which do not have serial numbers and can be assembled from a kit or 3D-printed, under the passenger seat, authorities contend. Smith, whose rap sheet includes convictions for robbery and attempted murder, had previously posted a snap of the gun to his social media, authorities found. Smith was later charged with unlawful transport of firearms. Smith held without bail and is due back in court on March 22. His attorney did no immediately respond to requests for comment.
