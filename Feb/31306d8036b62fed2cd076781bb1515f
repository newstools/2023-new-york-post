The Hawks have their next head coach. According to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, Quin Snyder was offered the job and Atlanta plans on bringing in the 56-year-old former Jazz coach on a deal worth about $8 million per year. Snyder is doing his “due diligence,” according to Charania, but indications are that he will accept the job. The Hawks canned their previous head coach, Nate McMillian, on Tuesday after a mediocre 29-30 start to the season — despite having made the Eastern Conference finals two years ago and recently bringing in All-Star guard Dejounte Murray this past offseason to bolster their backcourt. Snyder morphed the Jazz into a perennial playoff contender during his eight years with Utah. He led the Jazz to the playoffs each of the past six seasons, though Utah never made it past the Western Conference semifinals. He then resigned last June before the Jazz shipped out their two stars, Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, as part of a rebuild. Snyder met virtually with Atlanta executives earlier in the week and the team was trying to “hire [him] swiftly.” Snyder also has ties to the Hawks – he worked one season as an assistant in Atlanta before joining Utah as its head coach.
