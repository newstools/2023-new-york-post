Talk about an unceremonious exit. The Titans parted ways with longtime left tackle Taylor Lewan after the 2022 NFL season ended, with the 31-year-old notching three Pro Bowls during his tenure with Tennessee. But the 6-foot-7 lineman didn’t appear to receive any special treatment – rather, the team appeared to dump all of his belongings on his front porch in garbage bags. “Shout out to the @Titans dropping my stuff off today. They even let me keep the shoulder pads,” Lewan tweeted, alongside a photo of his stuff sprawled out on his front porch. Lewan also responded to a Yahoo Sports Instagram post that featured the photo, which was captioned: “After eight years with the Titans, @taylorlewan had his personal belongings left on his doorstep in trash bags.” “9 years,” Lewan clarified. “BUT, what other way would they drop off my stuff? Golden suitcases?” Lewan reached stardom during his tenure with the Titans, but has struggled with injuries in the last few years. He only appeared in two games in 2022, and only started 32 games in his final four years in Tennessee. The Titans released him after the season ended, but Lewan still hopes to play in the NFL as an official free agent – though he has ruled out three teams he would join. “I would not go play for an AFC South team,” Lewan said on an episode of his “Bussin’ with the Boys” podcast with Will Compton, also a former Titans player. So, rule out the Texans, Colts, and Jaguars. He also let slip a team he has his eyes on. “I know the Bengals need a left tackle,” he said on the same podcast episode.
