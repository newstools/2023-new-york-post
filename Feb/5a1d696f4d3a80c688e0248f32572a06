A San Francisco mom accused of killing her young daughters — leaving their bodies in a hallway closet — was suffering from postpartum depression, police said in court. Paulesha Green-Pulliam faces two felony murder charges for the Dec. 23, 2022, deaths of Justice, 5, and Paragon, 22 months, after a judge Thursday ruled there was enough evidence to hold her for trial. The San Francisco crime eerily echoes the shocking case of Massachusetts mom Lindsay Clancy, who allegedly suffered from postpartum depression when she strangled her three young kids. During a preliminary hearing in San Francisco Superior Court, police officers testified how Paragon and Justice were found in a hallway closet with a box containing birth certificates, sonogram photos and a pregnancy test, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. According to police reports, the boxed items related to the little girls’ deceased baby brother, who died shortly after birth. Paul Anthony, Green-Pulliam’s boyfriend, told officers his girlfriend suffered from undiagnosed postpartum depression since they lost their infant son. Anthony said he found the girls lying upward on the bench of the hallway closet when he arrived at their Bayview-Hunters Point home after being gone for a few days. On Thursday, several officers testified they saw a “foam-like substance” oozing from Paragon’s mouth. Sgt. Francis Graves testified she saw a thick cloth that held back the child’s tongue. Officer Rachel Leung, who arrested Green-Pulliam, said the mother told her the girls were “sex trafficked,” adding: “I should have let that happen rather than take their life.” The girls’ cause of death hasn’t been determined pending completion of their autopsies, police testified. Green-Pulliam’s next court date is March 2.
