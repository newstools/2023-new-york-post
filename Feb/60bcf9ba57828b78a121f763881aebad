One of the longest-standing debates — how many times a week should one be washing their hair? – is coming to the fore. We’re frankly surprised that it didn’t come up in President Biden’s State of the Union address last night. We can only assume it got left on the cutting room floor. The once-a-day crowd are set in their ways, as are the curly-haired crowd, and the once-a-week team. The answer to everyone’s problems? Dry shampoo. Olaplex has debuted their new Nº.4D Clean Detox Dry Shampoo, which promises “light as air cleansing technology for scalp and hair that feel just washed.” We’ve tried this dry shampoo, along with 15 others (read our review here), and sufficed to say: we think it’s good enough to heal a divided nation. Yes, it’s that good. The New York Post Shopping team has tried the new Olaplex dry shampoo (after testing more than a dozen) and are beyond impressed by the results. Not only is it lightweight and airy but it doesn’t feel like any product is in your hair, and for that — it’s worth every penny. Plus, it doesn’t leave any leftover, unwanted residue.
