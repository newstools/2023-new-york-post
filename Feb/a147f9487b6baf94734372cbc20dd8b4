Metropolitan Opera star Lucine Amara, who has been described as “the greatest lyric soprano of our time,” has listed her New York City co-op for $1.44 million, The Post has learned. Made up of two bedrooms and three baths, the Upper West Side residence is just blocks from Riverside Park. Inside a pre-war building at 260 West End Ave., the home features a large foyer with views of the Hudson River. The kitchen features a large window — and comes with a powder room that can be converted into a washer/dryer unit, the listing notes. Spanning 1,250 square feet, the home also features an expansive living room and a dining area. “One can enjoy watching the sunsets and boat activity on the river from two large windows in the west-facing living room or from the primary bedroom,” the listing adds. The building is full-service with a 24-hour attended lobby, a live-in-super, a laundry room, a bike room and storage units. Peter McLean with Corcoran holds the listing. Amara, now 97, fought the Met for age discrimination at age 51, and successfully won the lawsuit. She continued to perform and, in 1989, was inducted into the Academy of Vocal Arts Hall of Fame. Amara made her Metropolitan Opera debut in November 1950 and continued to perform over the next 41 seasons until 1991. In total, she appeared as 56 roles in a mighty 882 appearances – nearly 60 of which were broadcast on radio and TV. Her performances included primary roles in “Carmen,” “Madama Butterfly,” “La bohème,” Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin,” Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,” and Verdi’s “Il trovatore.”
