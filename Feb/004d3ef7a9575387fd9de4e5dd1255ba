Let’s be honest. We all miss sunshine and baseball. Luckily, both will be in full force come late February when the New York Yankees’ Spring Training gets underway in Florida. Aaron Boone’s Bronx Bombers have games lined up all over the Sunshine state from Feb. 25 through  March 27 before returning to New York for Opening Day on Thursday, March 30, against the San Francisco Giants. While these Grapefruit League games don’t “count,” they do serve an important purpose by allowing the coaching staff to determine which players will work their way up the depth chart and who makes the 26-man Opening Day roster. Can Aaron Hicks maintain his starting status in left field? Who starts at shortstop — Oswald Peraza or Isiah Kiner-Falefa? Will Aaron Judge, fresh off his record-breaking $360 million contract, feast on pitching like he did all last season? All we know is the best way to find out is by cheering or jeering from the bleachers, not on Twitter. Still not sold? At the time of publication, we found tickets for some games going for as low as $17 before fees on Vivid Seats. Plus, if you buy ten tickets on Vivid Seats, your eleventh is free. Now that is a steal. All prices are subject to fluctuation.

All prices are subject to fluctuation and include additional fees at checkout.) Vivid Seats is a verified secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. They offer a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure, and your tickets will be delivered prior to the event.  Now that you’re sold on seeing Gerrit Cole, Anthony Rizzo, Giancarlo Stanton, DJ LeMahieu and Gleyber Torres this March, we’re here to help you get there. If you choose to fly, we recommend searching for the best prices on Expedia. The site specializes in comparing airlines and packages side-by-side, with a calendar that includes both booking dates and alternative airports.  As noted earlier, nothing is set in stone once Spring Training starts. While Gerrit Cole most likely has the number one spot in the Yankees’ rotation locked up, the rest of the staff isn’t quite as secure. Free agent signee Carlos Rodón is a solid bet to occupy the number two position; Nestor Cortes and Luis Severino are almost sure things at three and four. Who rounds out the rotation?
