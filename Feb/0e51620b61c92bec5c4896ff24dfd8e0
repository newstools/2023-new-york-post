Talk about burying the lede. A recent for-sale listing, which provided a video tour of a seemingly normal home in the heart of Philadelphia, gave viewers the surprise of a lifetime when, by the end, the camera panned out to a cemetery in the backyard. Made up of three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the video, after being posted on TikTok, has already racked up more than 2.3 million views. At the time the video posted, the home was already in contract. And it appears the creepy, spine-chilling graveyard wasn’t enough to spook prospective buyers. An offer was quickly made on the property about a week after it went up for sale for $325,000. The buyer closed on the home on Feb. 14, with a final sale price of $317,500, records show. A previous description of the 1,234-square-foot home doesn’t make any mention of the cemetery. Instead, it simply says the Mt. Airy home “has been completely renovated.” Features, the listing notes, include an open-concept floor plan with wood floors, recessed lighting and a gourmet eat-in kitchen. Additional features include a finished basement, a deck (that looks out to a sea headstones) and floating stairs. “Conveniently located,” the listing adds, “there is plenty of dining and shopping nearby, close to public transportation and easy access to major highways.” “If you’re in the basement, you’re literally sleeping next to dead bodies,” one person commented. “That ‘backyard’ sweep was QUICK,” another noted. “This listing has me ‘dead’,” another quipped. Cheryl Newton with HomeSmart Realty Advisors held the listing.
