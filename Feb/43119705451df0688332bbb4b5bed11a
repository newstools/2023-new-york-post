Is there really such thing as owning too much athleisure? The comfy yet fit aesthetic has taken over our wardrobes — and for good reason. Whether you’re doing yoga, going to the gym or just lounging around, the style is versatile enough to do it all. We’ve even seen trends melding professional wear with athleisure. That’s right, you can actually pair your most professional blazer with some soft joggers. If you need an excuse to snag fresh loungewear, look no further than Universal Standard’s secret sale. Right now, the brand is having a major discount on its Next—to—Naked Bodyshort (like 56% off!), which is only being advertised on TikTok. That means, unless its popped up on your “For You Page,” it’s unlikely you’ve heard about it. How do you score this amazing offer then? After you choose your color, size and add it to your cart, type in the code NAKED50 and, voila, it’ll instantly drop that full price down to a beautiful 56% off. The popular style combines bike shorts with a supportive smooth top, and has garnered rave reviews with some shoppers going as far as calling it their “new favorite outfit.” There are five colors to choose from (or more like stock up on) including your basic neutrals like black and gray or grab the Matcha Latte Swirl for a fun statement piece. Regardless, you’ll never want to take it off once you feel the smooth moisture-wicking material that’s also anti-microbial and breathable. You don’t just have to wear it to the gym either, pair it with a denim jacket and your go-to sneakers for a more casual, everyday fit. For more content, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
