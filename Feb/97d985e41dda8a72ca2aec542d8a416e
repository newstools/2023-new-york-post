Old Man Winter may soon finally stop skimping on snow. New Yorkers could wake up on Tuesday to several inches of fluffy white snow, but the suburbs are expected to get the biggest dump in what is expected to be the first significant winter storm of the season, forecasters said. The fast-approaching storm is set to arrive Monday evening and bring the heaviest snowfall to Westchester County, north New Jersey and Connecticut, Fox Meteorologist Greg Diamond told The Post. “We’re looking at 5 to 8 inches,” Diamond said of the snowfall, which is expected to continue in regions north and west of the Big Apple through Tuesday morning. Gotham will be sprinkled with between 3 to 5 inches of snow, as will Long Island and the Central Jersey coast. But by the time most people wake up in these regions and along the Connecticut coast, rain will also be in the mix. “It will continue as only snow until probably early [Tuesday] morning,” Diamond said. The National Weather Service cautioned that “snowfall amounts for the N.Y.C./N.J. metro and Long Island are the most uncertain.” Forecaster said drivers should exercise caution on their morning commutes, but are unlikely to face icy roads as temperatures rise into the upper 30s Tuesday. “A lot of [the snow] will melt as it as it falls. So it shouldn’t cause too many issues travel-wise but still could lead to a slow morning commute tomorrow morning,” Diamond said. The storm comes amidst an unseasonably warm winter, notably lacking in snow. New York City recorded its first measurable snowfall at the start of February when half an inch of snow fell over Central Park.  Days earlier, the city broke a 50-year record for the longest stint without snow. The New York region had been spared from brutal winter weather last week when two storms ripped across the US, including Los Angeles County, which issued a rare blizzard warning.
