He’s not a multi-tusker. A meandering — and masturbating — walrus named Thor has popped up in Iceland, two months after eagle-eyed Brits spotted him visiting the UK. Elís Pétur Elísson, who was supervising a fishing boat in the Breiddalsvik harbor, noticed Thor lounging on one of the floating docks Friday. Approaching him with caution, the group of fishermen realized he was “just chilling there.” “He was there all day resting, and we’ve been over a few times, and he hasn’t moved at all,” Elísson, 41, told SWNS after snapping a few photos of the marine mammal. “The weather has been really good, so we thought he has traveled a long way, and now he is sunbathing.” After a local news outlet ran Elísson’s pictures, fans immediately recognized the walrus as Thor. The director of welfare and conservation at the British Divers Marine Life Rescue compared patches on his flippers to that of the walrus that beached in the UK just months earlier. His last sighting was Jan. 2 in Northumberland, so his reappearance has “delighted” the marine rescue. “After Thor’s visit to the UK we wondered if we would ever see him again,” the British Divers Marine Life Rescue wrote in a Facebook post Friday. “We are delighted to have been informed that he is in Iceland!!” Elísson had “no idea” the walrus had “famously been all over the world.” “He was alive and well, and I’ll be interested to see where he pops up next!” he exclaimed. Thor previously made waves for masturbating in front of the UK town of Scarborough heading into 2023. Officials canceled New Year’s festivities to protect the blubbery beast, only for him to perform an NSFW marine peep show instead, rubbing one out with his flipper. While bizarre, IFLScience reported it’s not uncommon for wild animals to take part in X-rated solo acts. As for his Iceland plans, Thor’s lips are sealed.
