Crime’s taken a bite out of him! Mayor Eric Adams’ approval rating has dropped to just 37% as New Yorkers continue to express dissatisfaction with how he is handling crime in the Big Apple, a new Quinnipiac University poll shows. Overall, slightly more than a third of voters gave Adams positive marks compared to 43% who disapprove of the job he’s done. One in five opted not to respond. The survey of roughly 1,300 registered voters shows that crime remains the leading issue in all five boroughs — with 59% of respondents in the Bronx saying it is their biggest worry, followed by 47% on Staten Island and 42% in Queens. “A law-and-order mayor confronts a cold winter of discontent as crime far eclipses all other voters’ concerns,” said Tim Malloy, the polling analyst at Quinnipiac University. That’s a flip from the last Quinnipiac survey, which was taken in May 2022, that found Adams’ approval rating was 43% approving versus 37% disapproving. Voters in that survey, too, said they were dissatisfied with how City Hall was handling crime. The mayor brushed aside the numbers when he was asked during a press conference at City Hall on Wednesday. “Polls go up and down, up and down. We’re just going to do what we do — and that’s produce for New Yorkers,” Adams told reporters at a press conference, though he added that he had not seen the poll yet. Adam’s strongest support came from Brooklyn — where he was borough president for eight years — and the Bronx. He posted his weakest numbers on Staten Island. Black voters and those over 65 were the only two demographic groups to give Hizzoner positive ratings, with 52 and 46% approving respectively. White voters and those between 18-34 and 35-49 were the most likely to disapprove of Adams’ job performance. Affordable housing placed second as the city’s biggest issue and homelessness came in third. The survey had a margin of error of +/- 2.7 percentage points and was conducted from Jan. 26 to Jan. 30.
