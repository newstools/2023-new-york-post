A 15-year-old boy was repeatedly stabbed, pummeled — and even shot at — in a targeted attack on a Bronx street this week, police said. The teen was standing at the corner of Morris Avenue and East 174th Street in Mount Hope just before 5 p.m. on Monday when a group of six men or boys came up and started punching him, cops said. One of the attackers stabbed the teen several times in the torso with a knife, authorities said. A second suspect then pulled a gun and fired in the teen’s direction but missed him, cops said. The victim was taken to Lincoln Medical Center for injuries to his torso. He was listed in stable condition. Police say he was targeted in the attack but did not have any information on the motive or whether the victim exchanged words with the suspects. The NYPD released photos late Wednesday of three suspects, who appear to be teens. No arrests have been made.
