Three dolphins died over the weekend when they became stuck in shallow water along the Jersey Shore, according to reports. The trio of sea animals were seen struggling in the surf at Sandy Hook Bay Saturday morning, according to footage posted on Twitter by photographer Mathew Renk. A rescue team from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center was not able to reach the sea mammals in time, according to NJ.com. “We picked them up,” Sheila Dean, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center told the outlet. “All of them perished on the beach.” A witness told the Asbury Park Press one of the dolphins was “aggressively trying to get out, back the way it came to deeper water,” while “the other two were confused.” The dolphin carcasses, all males, were taken by the center so necropsies could be performed on them and a cause of death determined, ABC 7 reported. Dean told NJ.com that it’s not uncommon for dolphins to get stranded in the winter, but it is strange for three of them to get lost at once. “I don’t know why they ended up in shallow water,” she said of the dolphins. “They just start thrashing about.” The trio of dolphins is just the latest rash of large sea animals to wash ashore in the tri-state area. Last Friday a dead whale was found on a Queens beach, making it at least the 10th to be discovered in the New York and New Jersey area since early December. The 25-foot whale found Friday was likely hit and killed by a vessel before it washed up on the shore of the Rockaways, the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society said.
