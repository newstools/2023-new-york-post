A man was killed in Times Square Thursday in a shooting that’s believed to have been carried out by suspected drug dealers, police and sources said. Two men rushed outside of a deli near the corner of West 44th Street and Eighth Avenue around 5:15 p.m. and began shooting, striking a 22-year-old man in the chest, cops and the sources said. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. It’s unclear if he was targeted in the attack. The two suspects are believed to be drug dealers, law enforcement sources said. The gunfire in the bustling tourist and commuter district left passersby rattled. One straphanger told The Post he was coming out of the subway station when he heard a shot ring out. “There were two uniform policemen… in front of the turnstiles when you come out and I shouted for them to come out,” said the man, who gave his name as John Smith, adding that he felt “frightened” walking onto the street. Another New Yorker said he was “shocked” that there was a shooting in the busy tourist area. “I could have been the one. That’s my thought. I could have been the one,” Steve, who chose not to share his last name, told The Post, noting that he works in Times Square. “I have a daughter at home, my wife at home. Like I could have been the one. So I’m happy that I am not the one; that I’m here and it’s scary.” The NYPD shut down the entire intersection as dozens of officers investigated the shooting. The gunmen are still on the lam, police said.
