Forget Mario Kart – this preteen is showing off her Mercedes-Benz. An 11-year-old girl, who allegedly makes more than $133,000 a month, said that she plans on retiring so that she can focus on her schooling, according to News.com.au. The girl, Australian native Pixie Curtis, also revealed that she owns a luxury car . . . despite not being able to drive it. With her mom’s help, Curtis has her fingers in many pies, including her now-multimillion-dollar business, Pixie’s Pix. Her sales of hair bows and fidgets took off during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Pixie has decided to hang her online toy store shoes up to focus on her impending entry into high school,” momager Roxy Jacenko said. “In short, over the past few months, we have been discussing the business plans going forward as a family and decided that while it has been an amazing journey starting some three years ago, it was time to refocus with high school just around the corner.” Jacenko continued, “While the Pixie’s Pix online store will remain, it will go back to how it began in 2011 — as the best destination for children’s hair accessories and hair bows known as Pixie’s Bows — something that we will continue to manage together but with a lot less time/pressure for Pixie.” The p.r. guru sparked controversy when she bought a then-10-year-old Curtis the luxury car for her birthday. “It’s of utmost importance to me that both she and her brother Hunter travel safely on the roads when going to and from school, so I purchased a car for her,” defended Jacenko. The 11-year-old went viral again in August after having a lavish birthday party at a night club. “The event was a wonderful night celebrating with Pixie’s friends and family,” said Jacenko. “The guests were overheard saying OMG that was the best party EVERRRRRRR.”
