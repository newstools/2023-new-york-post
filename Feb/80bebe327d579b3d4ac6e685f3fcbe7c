Rev. Al Sharpton’s half brother Kenneth Glasgow is facing up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to tax evasion, mail fraud, and drug conspiracy charges on Friday. Glasgow, an Alabama pastor and voting rights activist, entered a plea deal in Montgomery federal court, avoiding a trial that was scheduled to start in March. He’s also the founder of the “Prodigal Child Project” another nonprofit that organizes pastors to assist prisoners and ex-cons. The MSNBC host’s half-brother is the founder of the faith-based non-profit “The Ordinary People Society” that helps individuals and families suffering from “the effects of drug addiction, incarceration and homelessness, unemployment, hunger and illness,” according to its website. Glasgow admitted to not paying income taxes on thousands of dollars that he withdrew from his charity organizations and falsely claiming on Social Security forms that he had trouble driving to receive disability benefits. In fact, Glasgow, 56, received numerous citations at around 27 different  traffic stops between 2015 and 2020, all of which indicated that he was the driver, prosecutors said. Additionally, he pleaded guilty with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine. He and another man were slapped with the drug conspiracy charges in 2021. Federal prosecutors said in a statement Friday that Glasgow faces up to 20 years in prison along with major fines and restitution. “Kenneth Glasgow’s actions not only endangered the community, but defrauded the American taxpayers,” Paul Brown, Special Agent in Charge for the FBI said in a statement. “His guilty plea should help to dissuade others from following this same path.” With Post Wires
