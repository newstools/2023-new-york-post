He swiped right, but left in a hurry. A woman has gone viral on TikTok after revealing that her Hinge date left to go “move his car” seconds after meeting her in a sports bar — only to never come back. Florida native Rachel Wilson said that she then received a text from the man saying, “Sorry wasn’t feeling it,” complete with a sad-face emoji. The TikTok has gained nearly 4 million views since it was posted last month. According to Wilson, she was supposed to meet the fella who drove away at the bar for “chicken wings and a beer.” Wilson said that she waited outside the bar before she received the text informing her that he took off. “I stood in front of the restaurant waiting for about five minutes before I got the text,” said the 28-year-old. “I didn’t respond and immediately deleted his number and have heard no word from him since.” Wilson was left baffled by the sudden disappearance of her date since she didn’t pick up on any sketchy behavior while they were chatting on the app. Despite the fleeting feelings, Wilson stated the small hiccup will not deter her from looking for love. Wilson also said that while the date took a left turn into nothing, she is happy that they made plans. “I liked that he made solid plans right off the bat,” stated the jilted lover. “I hate when you meet someone on a dating app and talk back and forth forever, with no solid plans to meet.” Several of Wilson’s followers weighed in on the date. “At least he texted you. Many would have blocked you and left,” stated one user. “I had a guy fake having MS 5mins into mine. Happened last week,” said another. “I saw my gym crush on Hinge. He lived 15 mins away from me but told me he couldn’t do long distance,” sympathized a third person. “I still would see him at the gym before I moved.” “I mean technically he did move his car,” one person joked. “Away from you, the restaurant, and closer to his house.”
