A straphanger was repeatedly slashed in a random mid-afternoon attack inside a Midtown train station this week, cops said. The victim, a 37-year-old male, was standing on the southbound platform at the Fifth Avenue/53rd Street station around 3:40 p.m. Tuesday when the stranger approached him and slashed him several times with a pocket knife, police said. The victim refused medical attention for small cuts on his head and right leg, authorities said. The male suspect fled into the street. Itâ€™s unclear if he said anything during the attack. A photo released late Thursday shows the bearded assailant wearing a black vest over a bright yellow hoodie. He was still being sought Friday.
