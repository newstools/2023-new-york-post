Reese Witherspoon admitted she had no clue who Robert De Niro was when she waltzed into an audition in the early days of her career. During an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Thursday, the actress recalled walking into a room to read her lines in front of the “Goodfellas” star when she was just 14 years old. “I didn’t know who Robert De Niro was, so I was standing outside talking to the receptionist. She was like, ‘You know he’s the most important actor of our time, right?'” Witherspoon told host Jimmy Kimmel. The Oscar winner, who was auditioning for De Niro’s 1991 film “Cape Fear,” said she “bricked that audition” after not having a clue who he was. “I was 14. I’d never seen ‘Goodfellas.’ I’d never seen ‘The Godfather.’ So it totally got on my nerves,” she added. Witherspoon crossed paths with the actor at another audition a decade later, when she naively thought he was “never gonna remember that I bricked that audition.” “And he was like, ‘I remember you,'” she recalled. “I was like, ‘Me?’ He’s like, ‘Oh yeah. You’re the one who couldn’t say the word.’” The 46-year-old admitted she no longer remembered the word she had trouble pronouncing. “Oh, my God! This is so bad,” the “Legally Blonde” star added. Witherspoon revealed another awkward encounter she had with yet another Hollywood icon. Recalling a time when she worked as an intern for Denzel Washington’s 1995 film “Devil in a Blue Dress,” Witherspoon said one of her duties was to park Washington’s Porsche when he arrived on set. “Not a good idea for a 17-year-old kid with a brand-new driver’s license,” she quipped. “Oh, my God! I stripped all the gears, it was terrible,” she laughed. “The funny story is, I saw him a few years ago at a wedding, and he’s like, ‘I’ve heard you tell this story about how you used to park my Porsche.’ And I was like, ‘Yes, I did.’”
