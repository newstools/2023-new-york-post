Gerard Gallant’s New York Rangers are on the playoff bubble. Sitting at seventh place in the NHL’s Eastern Conference with a 27-14-8 record after the All-Star break, Igor Shesterkin, Ben Harpur, and Adam Fox’s squad will need all the support they can summon from their loyal fanbase to ascend from the middle of the East to comfortably secure a berth in the 2023 postseason. And if you want to see them live on their ice at Madison Square Garden, you still can at one of the team’s remaining 15 home games. That includes huge matchups against some of the best teams in the East, like the Western Conference phenoms Seattle Kraken (Feb. 10) and 27-20-6 Washington Capitals (March 14) who are also clawing it out with several teams on the verge of a playoff spot. Best of all though, some tickets to see the Broadway Blueshirts can be snatched up for as low as $75 before fees on Vivid Seats.
