As trade rumors swirl, Jalen Ramsey is firing back. The six-time Pro Bowler reeled off a series of tweets after NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that it is “very likely” the Los Angeles Rams will trade the cornerback this offseason. “The ‘story’ sounds better than the truth sometimes I’ll admit that… I live in the truth tho,” Ramsey wrote. “God is so great! I am blessed & highly favored!” Ramsey later revealed that the rumor interrupted a swanky meal. It’s not the first time this offseason Ramsey has responded to reports that he might be on the trade block. The star defensive back tweeted and then deleted a post saying he might get traded earlier this month. “I can PROMISE you, I won’t get cut . . . now trade? Maybe lol,” Ramsey responded to a tweeter speculating that he might get cut this offseason. Eventually, Ramsey reposted a response that said, “100% chance I WONT get cut . . . God bless tho.” In 2020, Ramsey signed a contract worth $100 million over five years. The deal still carries $32.1 million in dead cap in 2023 and $11.4 million in dead cap in 2024. The 28-year-old Ramsey started all 17 games for the Rams this past season and recorded four interceptions. He made his eighth straight Pro Bowl. The Rams are reportedly looking to create more cap space as they try to recover from what was a disastrous 2022 season. After winning the Super Bowl in 2022, Los Angeles went 5-12 and finished third in the NFC West. The team also mutually agreed to part ways with star linebacker Bobby Wagner, in what was, at least in part, a cap-saving move.
