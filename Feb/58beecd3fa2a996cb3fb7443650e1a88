Paige Spiranac locked in her Super Bowl 2023 pick. The golfer-turned-influencer shared her selections ahead of Sunday’s showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles at State Farm Stadium in Arizona. “Who do you think will win? Eagles or Chiefs?” the 29-year-old teased in an Instagram post, urging fans to click through her photoset of her wearing a white crop top and black booty shorts. The big reveal? Her shirt, offering “Shakes for Philadelphia touchdowns.” It’s not much of a surprise, seeing as how she picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl back in January, though Spiranac accompanying prediction didn’t exactly stand up. “The Eagles, they’re going to win the Super Bowl,” she claimed in an Instagram video. “And, you know what, I like a little TCU upset for the national championship.” The Horned Frogs were infamously trounced by Georgia in the CFB National Title Game in January. Spiranac is in Phoenix ahead of the big game, serving as a correspondent for “Inside Edition,” and of course, giving fans plenty of content to enjoy. On Tuesday, she shared video of herself running through a drills course in a striped dress and denim jacket, carrying a football over hurdles and taking down a tackling dummy. “I’m ready coach, get me on the field,” she joked. She found a secondary use for the tackling dummy, posting a picture of her mid-takedown on Twitter and writing, “How men expect me to act when they send d-ck pics in the DMs.” Spiranac has been in the big game spirit all week, sharing her excitement with “Inside Edition.” She took in lessons from the Chiefs and Eagles cheerleaders, learning how to shake her pom-poms and learning their moves. “It’s going to be my first Super Bowl. I can’t wait, I’m really excited,” she said, adding she’s thrilled to see Rihanna’s return to the stage for the Super Bowl 2023 Halftime Show.
