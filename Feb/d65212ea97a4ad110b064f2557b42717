A Thai drug lord has been busted despite getting plastic surgery while on the run to look like a “handsome Korean man,” according to cops. Saharat Sawangjaeng, 25, was busted Thursday after more than three months on the run — while pretending to be a South Korean national named Jimin Seong, cops told the Bangkok Post. Mugshots showed how he’d seemingly completely changed his appearance in a case being likened to the 1997 action flick “Face/Off.” “None of his original face was left,” a police official told the outlet. Sawangjaeng was accused by cops of being a “drug lord” who was “one of the main causes of Bangkok’s MDMA epidemic” who flooded clubs with ecstasy. Despite being on the run, he continued behind-the-scenes dealings in his drug empire, helping cops locate him at his luxury condo where he was hiding out. However, neighbors told them that only a “handsome Korean man” lived there — whom police ultimately realized was their suspect. He reportedly told cops that he planned to move to South Korea, even though he cannot speak the language. “I want to start a new life. I am bored of Thailand,” he said during the arrest, according to the BBC. Local media called it the “Face/Off” case after the John Woo movie starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta as an FBI officer and a criminal who swap faces.
