The Mets are coming off a 101-win campaign that ended without an NL East title and with playoff heartbreak in the wild-card round against the Padres. The most expensive roster in baseball history comes with a revamped starting rotation that includes reigning AL CY Young winner Justin Verlander stepping in to take the place of Jacob deGrom — who is now a Texas Ranger. Much of the everyday roster looks almost the same after the Mets were unable to close the deal with star Carlos Correa amid an issue with the All-Star’s medicals. It will also open up chances for a number of the organization’s top prospects — especially third baseman Brett Baty — that may finally be able to help the team at the MLB level. Here is the 2023 Mets depth chart entering spring training.
