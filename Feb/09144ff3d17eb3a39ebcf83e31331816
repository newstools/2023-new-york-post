Tom Brady took a stroll down memory lane on Wednesday after announcing his second NFL retirement, posting a collection of photos taken over the years that included a heartfelt moment with his ex, “Blue Bloods” actress Bridget Moynahan, and their 15-year-old son Jack. In a post shared on his Instagram story, the seven-time Super Bowl champ, 45, can be seen posing beside his eldest child and Moynahan, 51. Brady and Moynahan dated for three years before splitting up in 2006. The quarterback later moved on with supermodel Gisele Bündchen, whom he married in 2009. The couple confirmed their divorce in October after 13 years of marriage. In addition to Moynahan, who married businessman Andrew Frankel in 2015, Brady also included Bündchen in his retirement post, as well as their two children: daughter Vivian, 10, and son Benjamin, 13. “Good morning guys, I’ll get to the point right away. I’m retiring, for good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first. It won’t be longwinded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year,” Brady said in an emotional video Wednesday, referencing his lengthy social media message from February 2022. Moynahan posted a sweet Instagram tribute to Brady after he announced his initial retirement last year, writing in part: “Yesterday and today and I know you will do great things tomorrow. Looking forward to the next steps.” Elsewhere, Bündchen sent Brady well-wishes following his announcement Wednesday. “Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life,” she commented on Instagram.
