Julianne Moore was outgunned in this role. Staunch gun control campaigner Moore was seen holding a firearm on screen for the first time in 15 years in the Apple TV movie “Sharper,” according to the Sunday Times. “It’s not something I feel drawn to at all. I don’t find it appealing,” said the 62-year-old actress. The last time Moore was seen on screen with a gun was in the 2007 film “Next.” In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, the “Hunger Games” star co-founded a group called Everytown for Gun Safety. “10 million everyday Americans who have come together to make their own communities safer,” reads the site’s homepage. “I’ve been very involved in the gun safety movement because I realized I wasn’t keeping my children safe if I didn’t do my part to change the legislation,” said Moore. “I thought, ‘I’m not being the kind of parent I want to be.’ I thought that if something happened to them it would be my fault.” “It’s really important when you talk about gun safety and people blame entertainment to realize that the entire world consumes the same entertainment as the US, but the US has easy access to weapons,” continued Moore. “So I am not a big fan of violent movies, but I also don’t blame gun violence on entertainment.” Moore said that her status as an A-list actor has nothing to do with her campaigning for change. “I don’t think it has anything to do with being an actor,” said Moore. “I think about it in terms of being a citizen of my country. If there is something you care about you feel you need to take action.” “So everything I’ve done politically has been about how I feel personally. A job is a job, but as a citizen you have a responsibility to participate in a community,” said the actress. “Sharper” is set to make a limited theatrical release on February 10 before moving to Apple TV.
