Here’s a fine idea for New York City: San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey — an ex-cop and recovering addict — just proposed legislation to “withdraw sanctuary [city] protections” for any undocumented immigrant who is trafficking fentanyl. Dorsey’s measure would let ‘Frisco cops work with federal immigration authorities to deport immigrants convicted of dealing fentanyl as well as other major, violent felonies. In San Francisco as well as here and around the country, progressive district attorneys have sought lesser charges for immigrants who’d likely face deportation if convicted of a felony. New York’s City Council has even reclassified offenses so as not to trigger deportable criminal violations. Plus, the state’s top court in 2019 ordered that noncitizens at risk of deportation get jury trials in the city even for minor offenses to prevent “collateral consequences” for criminal defendants here illegally. The result is to shield members of criminal gangs as well as major drug and even human traffickers. How is this sane? The city’s sanctuary policy began as an effort to ensure those whose only crime was being here illegally would still cooperate with law enforcement against against active criminal threats. Somehow, it’s become a license for serious bad guys to dodge justice. Absolutely, make sure a traffic ticket, or even a DUI, doesn’t get a longtime city resident deported. But stop letting gangsters, drug kingpins and other monsters claim the same protection.
