Cops have identified the gunman they believe opened fire on a straphanger during a fight on a Lower Manhattan subway late last month. Marcos Cofresi, 30, allegedly blasted a 34-year-old man in the stomach and forearm just after 1 a.m. Jan. 28 aboard a southbound N train as it pulled into the Canal Street and Broadway station, police said. Cofresi and his female companion were involved in a fight with the victim before the suspect fired off two rounds, cops said. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, according to police. “Detectives were able in this one to quickly and early on to identify the perpetrator of this crime,” NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a Tuesday press conference. “We’re asking for the public’s help in finding his whereabouts.” The gunman – seen wearing a white neck gaiter with a skull on it – ran off with the woman as the train pulled into the station, cops said. The distinctive face-covering may have sparked a “What are you looking at?” argument that escalated into bloodshed, police sources said at the time. Cofresi, who lives in Bushwick, has two prior arrests for criminal possession of marijuana and fare evasion, Essig said. He is about 5-foot-10 and was also seen wearing a dark-colored jacket with “New York” written on the front of it, dark-colored sweatpants, gray sneakers and a “New York Yankees” baseball hat, police said. Police released his mugshot Tuesday and were still looking for him Wednesday.
