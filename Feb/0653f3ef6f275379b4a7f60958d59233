A swanky duplex at Fasano Fifth Avenue has just hit the market for a hefty $120,000 a month, with that asking price making it the city’s second priciest rental now up for grabs, according to StreetEasy. (StreetEasy also shows the most expensive city rental these days stands in the same building, 815 Fifth Ave., asking $140,000 per month.) The lower price doesn’t make this newly listed spread any less grand. The three-bedroom, 3½-bath residence at the property — a private club and quasi-hotel (you can’t rent a room for a night, but you can rent for a minimum of 30 days) — is a spacious 3,600 square feet. It was designed by Thierry Despont — the French starchitect known for restoring the Statue of Liberty and renovating the Ritz Paris — with custom and vintage furniture, along with upscale Loro Piana textiles. It’s all in a 14-story building that dates to 1910. Fasano, an upscale Brazilian brand new to the North American market, offers seven clubhouse suites asking around $38,000 a month and four apartment-like duplexes. The other three have already rented for $120,000 or more. Fasano’s amenities include a gym, a terrace, a concierge, a Mercedes car (and a driver!) — and, this being a Brazilian brand, a private restaurant and bar with a bossa nova jazz band on weekends. “It’s private, exclusive and intimate,” said listing broker Erin Boisson Aries of Douglas Elliman.
