They put a royal spin on working out. Prince William and Princess Kate visited Aberavon Leisure & Fitness Centre in Wales to show how exercise can benefit mental health — and appeared to struggle when they joined in on a class. William, 40, and Kate, 41, hopped on bikes in a spin class while wearing business attire. Kate wore a long skirt with a long-sleeve turtleneck top and heels, while William wore a full suit, tie and all. The Prince and Princess of Wales competed against each other and really pushed themselves … for a whole 45 seconds. William, who can be seen putting his hand on his abdomen while recovering, looked spent by the end of the ride. Kate came out on top, besting her husband in their short-lived race. The rest of the spin class seemed to ignore the royals’ apparent struggles and clapped for them. The royal workout class comes amid a slew of headlines about the royal family, including the never-ending tales coming out of Prince Harry’s memoir, the recent “South Park” episode mocking Harry and Meghan Markle, and King Charles’ upcoming coronation.
