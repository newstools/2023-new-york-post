Get this baby a badge! A toddler in Williamsburg, Kentucky, received praise from law enforcement after the child helped officers locate a fugitive while attempting to serve multiple outstanding warrants to the suspect on Friday. Deputies with the Whitley County Sheriff’s Department are calling the toddler “very brave and honest” for assisting in the arrest after none of the adults at the residence would say whether the fugitive was in the home, police reported. “It is good to be honest… we shouldn’t lie,” the unnamed small child told officers before pointing out where the suspect was hiding. Tina Hicks, 45, was found in the bathroom and was swiftly taken into custody by law enforcement. The toddler, who was only visiting the home, was in the “wrong place at the wrong time” and deputies would have dealt with the well-being of the child if they believed he was in danger, police said. “He was healthy, intelligent, and in no way appeared to be abused,” the sheriff’s office said. Hicks was served with two outstanding warrants for possession of meth and drug paraphernalia while also served with an additional four other outstanding court warrants, which law enforcement did not specify.
