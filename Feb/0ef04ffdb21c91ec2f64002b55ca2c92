An airplane carrying dozens of passengers from Scotland to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York made an emergency landing Friday after flames erupted from a wing. A video of the terrifying incident showed massive sparks bursting from the aircraft as worried passengers cry in the background. Passengers told BBC that they heard a loud bang not long after the plane soared from the Edinburgh airport. The JFK-bound Delta Airlines flight DAL209 quickly diverted to the  Glasgow Prestwick airport located just 80 miles from the takeoff point. The plane had only been in the air about 40 minutes before it was forced to land. Flight crew told the outlet the plane was suffering from engine problems. “The plane took off and there was a loud engine noise, similar to the noise normally during take-off and landing, but it seemed to continue once we were in the air,” BBC News journalist Laura Pettigrew — who was on board — said. The captain walked the length of the aircraft just before the crew told passengers they would be making an emergency landing, she said. “When the plane touched down we could see fire trucks and firefighters with hoses rushing towards us,” Pettigrew said. The reporter noted that passengers appeared more confused than panicked, other than families with children. Among the passengers were children and teachers from a secondary school on their way to the US for a trip over the February break, STV News reported. The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
