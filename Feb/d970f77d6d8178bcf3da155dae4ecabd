President Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech Tuesday surely set a record for lies, distortions and sheer hollowness, yet most media’s coverage was preposterously positive — indeed, almost equally unhinged: OK, Biden was feisty and pulled no punches — but mostly all below the belt. He dishonestly claimed he’d “created” 12 million jobs, cut the deficit, restored manufacturing and lowered gas prices. Republicans want to “hold the economy hostage,” he fibbed, and “sunset” Social Security and Medicare. Of course Republicans were outraged and vocal, just as Democrats had groaned, booed and even boycotted during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speeches. (Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously ripped up the text of one for the cameras.) Even the outlets that fact-checked Biden (finding the whoppers too big and numerous to ignore) offset that with glowing praise. Contrast that with how they bent over backward to find fault with Trump — even when they found him reasonable and presidential: Imagine if they’d covered Biden’s speech Tuesday the way they did Trump: In a smug and venomous address, the president repeatedly baited opponents with falsehoods — even as he called for unity and bipartisanship. That would’ve been closer to the truth, but truth is no longer top priority for much of the modern media.
