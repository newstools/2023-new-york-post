Nobody wants to be a square. But ironically, everyone wants to have a Square. Maybe that’s what they mean when they talk about the duality of man? It’s 2023, do you have a side hustle yet? Maybe you sell burgers in the park after a 40-hour week working the grind. Maybe you have a near-endless closet of clothes to sell on your stoop. Fact of the matter is: it’s tough to live in New York without a side hustle to supplement your income. And if you’re a small business owner, or a very, very small business owner, and you’re tired of going the “cash only” route, one brand has cornered the market on card readers: Square. Not familiar? Try going into any coffee shop, ever. You might remember them from there. Luckily for the hustlers out there, the Square Terminal and Register card-reading devices are both 20% off this week on Amazon. Perfect for bars, restaurants, and smaller sellers, the Square Terminal can ring up sales, accept payments and print receipts from the counter, table, stoop, park, DIY show, and more. With a built in battery, and money in your account by the following day, accepting credit card payments has never been easier for small business owners. Get it now for over $50 off on Amazon.
