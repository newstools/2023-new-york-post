Jonathan Majors got a little antsy during his first meeting with Marvel. The 33-year-old actor, who stars as Kang the Conquerer in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” revealed that he almost walked out of his first meeting with the company because they were taking too long. “I hope this doesn’t bite me in the a-s, but I walked out of my Marvel general [meeting],” Majors admitted in an interview with Vanity Fair. Majors had just finished school at the Yale School of Drama in 2016 when he found himself waiting in the Marvel Studios office. “I grew up in a very particular way and I don’t want to waste nobody’s time. So I got in there and they’re just busy,” he said. “And I was like, ‘I’m supposed to be here, right?’ It got long and I went, ‘I’m just going to go. It’s cool. I’ll just go.’” As the “Lovecraft Country” star got to the door to leave, he was told casting director Sarah Finn was going to come, and he finally got to sit down with her. “We got in the room and we chatted. We were having this great conversation. I think it was three years later that we had the Kang chat,” Majors said. “And there’s no trepidation now, especially because of who Kang is. When I said yes, we got the whole picture, and what is being laid out is cohesive.” Majors’ Kang the Conquerer is the new villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a character arc that will go through at least 2025 with “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.” The character made its debut in the “Loki” Disney+ series, but the film will be Kang the Conquerer’s first time on the big screen. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” the third installment in the Ant-Man saga starring Paul Rudd as the titular role, opens in theaters Feb. 17.
