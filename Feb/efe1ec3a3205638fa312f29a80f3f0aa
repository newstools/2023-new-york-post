Is there anything Team Biden won’t drag ex-prez Donald Trump into as a butt-covering maneuver? In this case, the embarrassment was the Chinese spy balloon fiasco. And the butt-covering was the “leak” from a “defense official”  that balloons-from-Beijing entered US airspace at least three times in the Trump years.

So our Defense geniuses missed multiple earlier violations completely at the time. And on this round, they spotted the craft at some point, but Team Biden opted to keep it from the American public until regular citizens spotted it. John and Jane Q. Public remain in the dark on a host of crucial questions: And last but not least: Biden’s hacks owe the nation answers on all these questions — and pathetic attempts to just pin the blame on the last guy won’t cut it.
