Spring cleaning is right around the corner. It might be time to make sure you have a vacuum that’s up for the job. You could shop around for an expensive Dyson, or you could grab the vacuum CNN said made them “forget about Dyson.” The Jashen V18 350W Cordless Vacuum Cleaner is a lightweight and versatile vacuum that could make short work of your hard floors and carpets. For a limited time only, get this awesome vacuum for only $189.99. That’s down 43% from its normal price of $336. The JASHEN V18 has a 350W digital brushless motor that delivers strong suction to lift dirt and stains out of your carpet with ease. The whole thing has been optimized for more efficient noise reduction, and the battery could last for up to 40 minutes of cleaning. One user writes, “I needed a choice in getting a cordless vacuum cleaner but didn’t want to spend $400+. This suits my needs perfectly.” If you’re used to an older vacuum, there may be a lot of new luxuries to enjoy exploring. There’s no surprise when it’s time to change the filter. Just check the intelligent LED screen to check for filter cleaning alerts, remaining battery, and your current power mode. Cleaning the filter is just as easy as emptying the dustbin. Just remove, tap out the dust, and re-attach. No need to switch suction modes for different types of messes. The V18 has a dust sensor that tells it what you’re cleaning and what type of suction is required. The large roller is even specially suited to sucking up tangled hair off the floor.  If there’s a mess the dust brush can’t reach, your purchase comes with a set of specialized hose ends to get into nooks and crannies. Between the mini power brush and the crevice nozzle, there may not be much of your house left to clean after you’re through with it. There’s even an LED attachment so you can get a better view in those dark corners. For a limited time, get the Jashen V18 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner on sale for $189.99 (reg. $336).
