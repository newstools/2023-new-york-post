Think about your favorite TV show. Maybe you grew up on “The Simpsons.” Or you’re sort of a prestige TV sort of viewer: “Mad Men,” or “The Wire,” or “The Sopranos.” That’s cool. We like those, too. You may also be like, super into PBS and “Masterpiece Theater,” and “Downton Abbey.” That’s epic stuff too and we’re glad you like it. Personally, we prefer Amazon’s slate of original series and movies. Regardless of where your tastes lie, picture your favorite TV show, then map it onto a 65″ screen. Now consider that the 65″ screen that you’re picturing has over 8 million unique, self-lit OLED pixels, capable of producing a deep black and over a billion colors. Still picturing that? Now’s time for the big reveal. Everything described above can be yours, with the LG C1 Series 65″ OLED 4K Smart TV, over $1,000 off today on Amazon. Originally $2,500, this LG OLED 65″ Smart TV is now 44% off on Amazon, coming it at just under $1,400 this week.

Better yet: with built-in Amazon Alexa, you’ll never have to buy another remote ever again.
