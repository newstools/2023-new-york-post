Joy Behar shocked audience members of “The View” on Thursday when she implied that Donald Trump-voting residents of East Palestine, Ohio, have nobody to blame but themselves for the toxic train derailment that’s rocked the small town. Gasps could be heard from the crowd after the comment by Behar, who also insinuated that the devastating Feb. 3 derailment was a result of the former president’s actions in the White House. “I don’t know why they would ever vote for him, for somebody who, by the way, he placed someone with deep ties to the chemical industry in charge of the EPA’s chemical safety office,” said Behar, 80. The host then turned to face the camera with a pointed finger. “That’s who you voted for in that district. Donald Trump, who reduces all safety.” The crowd gasped at Behar’s finger-pointing but didn’t seem to have much of a reaction when co-host Sunny Hostin quipped, “I think this is Donald Trump’s fault” just before the show went to a commercial break. The panel had been discussing the train derailment — which so far has contaminated at least 1.1 million gallons of water and 15,000 pounds of soil — and politicians’ response to the tragedy. Trump toured the community Wednesday, which Behar claimed was a “photo-op” stunt. The former president — who recently launched his 2024 White House bid — handed out bottles of “Trump Water” and bought McDonald’s for residents and first responders while condemning President Biden for not making the same trip to the Ohio town. “That’s called chutzpah! It’s his fault and then he shows up,” Behar said. Behar continually became more heated on the subject, especially after co-host Alyssa Farah-Griffin called East Palestine “Trump country” and pointed out that the Republican won by about 40 points over Biden in the 2020 election.
