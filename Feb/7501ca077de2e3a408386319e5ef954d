Douglas Elliman’s Michael Lorber — son of the brokerage’s chairman, Howard Lorber — and fashion exec Jeffrey Goldmuntz recently married in Howard’s Miami home. Only immediate family and the couple’s English springer spaniel, River, were in attendance. “River was the ring bearer,” Lorber said, adding that they honeymooned at their Palm Beach residence. Images of the ceremony, held this month, made their way to Instagram where fellow Elliman broker Noble Black uploaded a post wishing the newlywed couple a “Happy one week anniversary.” He added, “You’re so good for and to each other … Love you both.” The reception will be held in April at the Grill in Midtown.
