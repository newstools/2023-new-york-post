It used to be so simple. You’d walk up to someone’s house and press a small button. You’d hear a faint *ding dong* ringing from inside the house, and soon someone would be at the door to help you, provided they were available. But times change, and so do doorbells. Gone are the days of the simple ding-dong. As home security becomes increasingly important to consumers, and online ordering (and thus package-theft) has risen, home-owners are turning away from a simple ding-dong doorbell, and towards the sighted doorbells of the future. If you’re still living in the past, by comparison, we have good news for you. The bestselling, and best-known video doorbell brand, Ring, is on sale on Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick up the latest model of the Ring Video Doorbell for 30% off. It used to be, unless a neighbor happened to be in the right place with a Polaroid, if you weren’t home, there’d be no way to tell who rang your doorbell. With the trusted, easy-to-install, you could be out of the county, state, or country and still see who’s knocking at your door with just a glance at your phone, tablet, or computer. Installation of the Ring Video Doorbell is as simple as connecting it to the WiFi, and mounting your new Ring to your home with the provided tools. Once it’s set up, you can receive mobile notifications whenever someone rings your doorbell, or gets picked up by the built-in motion sensors.
