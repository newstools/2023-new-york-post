Sweeny Murti is back. The longtime WFAN Yankees reporter left the station last month, but he isn’t leaving baseball. Murti has joined Major League Baseball, where he will serve in a multimedia role for its social media team as well as on podcasts and other projects, he announced Thursday. “This is a phenomenal opportunity that will allow me to help promote this wonderful game and tell the stories that bring its great players and personalities closer to you,” he tweeted. The move comes after Murti spent three decades at WFAN, where the Middletown, Pa., native began his tenure in 1993 as a producer and on-air anchor before moving into the role of Yankees reporter in 2001. Murti did not travel and wasn’t used in daily spots with the station in recent years, though he could have possibly stayed on in a a part-time role and with a spot on postgame shows, The Post’s Andrew Marchand reported. But he instead decided to move on. “Along the way I was so privileged to work on the biggest events in sports with legendary performers and personalities. The highlight of it all was spending the last 2 years talking to you about the New York Yankees,” Murti said last month in announcing his departure. “Everything good in my adult life truly began when I started as a producer at the FAN in March 1993. More good things are on the way – of that I am sure. I am eager to begin the next chapter.” That next chapter starts now. “I was lucky to have one dream job at WFAN,” Murti said Thursday. “And now I feel so fortunate to begin a second one at Major League Baseball.”
