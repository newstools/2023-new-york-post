An Indiana daycare director was fired after she allegedly admitted to doling out melatonin to lull children to sleep without parental approval, according to authorities. The former head of Kidz Life Childcare Ministry at New Life Church in Cumberland is facing multiple charges after she and another worker allegedly gave 17 small kids whose ages ranged from 1 to 4 melatonin gummies without their parentsâ€™ sign off, court documents said. The pastor of the church told local police after he learned the alleged gummy distribution was going on from mid-December through the end of January, court records indicate. Pastor David Faulk told police he fired 52-year-old Tonya Rachelle Voris after she admitted to giving out the melatonin to some of the kids, though the other worker still had a job following the revelation. Voris got the idea when one parent allowed her to use melatonin to help their child at nap time, according to an affidavit, the Indianapolis Star reported. Voris was pleased with the results, and started giving the gummies to other kids, the affidavit alleged. The bottle of melatonin gummies was given to investigators; the label on it says the gummies were for children ages 4 and older, according to the affidavit. The label also reportedly states possible side effects and says for the best result, the person taking it should get more than six hours of shut-eye. Several parents informed investigators their kids had problems sleeping and even developed a rash. Voris is charged with 11 counts of neglect of a dependent and six counts of reckless supervision by a childcare provider. She was released on bond after she was booked Monday. With Post wires
