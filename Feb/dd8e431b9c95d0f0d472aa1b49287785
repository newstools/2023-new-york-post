There are a vanishingly few set of circumstances when it’s appropriate to have a shark in the home. In fact, we can only think of two, off the top of our heads. One: you’re a criminal mastermind, and you own with a home replete with booby traps, such as a large, gold table fitted out with an industrial laser, etc. Your long term goals include wealth-accumulation, global domination, and the murder of MI6 secret agent 007. As such, owning a shark tank for super-spy trapping and eating purposes only makes sense. The other, of course, is if you’re interested in owning a top-of-the-line robot vacuum, such as the Shark AV911S EZ Robot Vacuum, now marked down a whopping 40% on Amazon. Save $200 on this Shark robot vacuum, and strike a chore from your to-do list, forever. The Shark AV911S is self-emptying, bagless, and compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, or a single tap of the Shark app. The Shark AV911S EZ Robot Vacuum can hold up to 30 days of dirt and debris before its’ charging stand needs to be emptied. With the push of a single button (on Amazon), and the push of one more single button (on your Shark app), you can make vacuum cleaning your home a thing of the past. Simply program a route and allow the superior suction power get to work. This Shark robot vacuum is perfect for pet hair, and debris both large and small, and it’s at the perfect price, for a limited time. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
