A Midtown East aerie once home to the late former CEO of GE, Jack Welch, is back on the market for $21.68 million. The 46th-floor home — once renovated by top designer Tony Ingrao and recently renovated again — is a combination of two units at One Beacon Court, 151 E. 58th St. At 5,782 square feet, the residence comes with five bedrooms, three bathrooms, two powder rooms — and views of Central Park, and the Hudson and East rivers. An entry gallery opens to corner living and dining rooms with 11-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, and an adjacent wet bar and wine storage — while a chef’s kitchen features pocket doors to separate it from the dining space. There’s also a main bedroom wing with a walk-in closet and an ensuite bath. Another wing features an additional four bedrooms — two of which have ensuite baths. Welch died in 2020 at age 84. He paid a combined $14.6 million for the units, which he bought separately — first in 2005, the year the tower was built, and the other in 2009. He first listed the combined residence for $25.9 million in 2018. He ended up selling it for $17 million in 2019. The buyer was Byron Real Estate LLC, which is linked to Cedric Varasteh, founder of the French broadband company Euro Techno Com Group, according to the Real Deal. In 2013, Mets owner Steve Cohen asked $115 million for his One Beacon Court penthouse, which lingered for eight years despite multiple dramatic price slashes. It finally sold for $30.5 million  — a 75% price cut — in June 2021. That buyer re-listed the penthouse for $36 million four months later, and sold it for $33 million last year. Amenities include a doorman, a concierge, a gym and a business center. The listing brokers — who declined comment — are Jason Haber, Allison L. Chiaramonte, Tania Isacoff Friedland and Nicole Durosko, of Compass.
