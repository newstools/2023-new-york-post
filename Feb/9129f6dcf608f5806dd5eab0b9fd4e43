A 25-foot whale that was likely struck and killed by a vessel was found washed up on the shore of the Rockaways Friday morning. The female minke whale that suffered “several broken bones and cut wounds across its body”  was spotted at 9 a.m. near Beach 29th Street, according to the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society. “There was additional evidence of blunt force trauma,” the group said, indicating the mammal likely died after being struck by a boat or other vessel. Heartbreaking images of the whale show at least three deep slashes running from its backside to its belly. Minke deaths have been increasing along the Atlantic coast since 2017, with at least 141 found dead within those years, prompting the NOAA to declare an Unusual Mortality Event. The minke whale is the second whale to wash up in the Rockaways since December. In the earlier case, a baby whale was still alive when it washed up on the neighborhood’s beach late last year, but died after rescuers were unable to push it back into the water. About two weeks ago, a 40-year-old humpback whale named Luna washed up on the shores of Long Beach. The 14.5-ton leviathan — that was tracked by scientists for decades — was also killed by a vessel while trying to breach the surface.
