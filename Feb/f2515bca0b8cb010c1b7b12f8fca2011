Taylor Lautner is not on any “team” Former teenage heartthrob Taylor Lautner revealed Thursday that the fan rivalry over whether Edward Cullen or Jacob Black (played by Lautner) should date Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) took a toll on him and his co-star. Lautner, who appeared on Thursday on “The Toast” podcast, said the whole thing was “very strange.” “”I was so young,” said Lautner, 30. “I was 16 when ‘Twilight’ came out, 17 for ‘New Moon’ and ‘Eclipse’. I finished the franchise by the time I was 19.” According to the “Scream Queens” star, he found the whole strange especially “being in different cities and having thousands of screaming fans either take your side or the other guy’s side.” Lautner lamented that he wished “Twihards” let the rivalry play out on the silver screen rather than bring it into the real world. Though, the actor did add that the rivalry never took a serious toll on his friendship with Pattinson. “Like, we’re a team. We’re both just trying to make the best movies,” Lautner said. “But it was a little bizarre, the competitiveness. There wasn’t a competitiveness between me and Rob, but having that constant reminder, it definitely had an impact.” Lautner also revealed that he understands why some fans wanted Bella to end up with her vampiric lover after rewatching the films last year while bored in a hotel room. “As I was watching it, I was like, ‘I kind of get it. Jacob’s a little annoying,'” joked Lautner. “Like, I love Jacob and his heart, but he’s a little annoying.”
