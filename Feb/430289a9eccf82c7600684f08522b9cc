With tech prices still inflated, it may seem like a bad time to be in the market for a computer. It would be, if not for high-quality refurbished devices that are available at a fraction of the price. If you need a reliable, versatile computer without burning through your budget, check out this refurbished MacBook Air that’s only $355 now through February 23. There’s a lot to love about buying refurbished computers, and the price is just the start. Getting one of these devices is also better for the environment. Still, all that wouldn’t be quite as exciting if you weren’t also scoring an awesome computer out of the deal. This MacBook Air is sleek, powerful, and it has been restored to near-mint condition. You might not even notice that it’s refurbished when you’re enjoying the 13.3-inch HD Retina Display. Take advantage of the powerful Intel Core i5 processor and multitask on all the apps you can install on a 128GB SSD. Charge up the battery and get up to 12 hours of performance out of your computer. That might make working on the road or doing homework at a coffee shop a lot easier. It’s not all about work, though. The Intel HD Graphic 6000 GPU can render high-quality images and video seamlessly, so pull up your favorite movie or download some games. If you’re gaming, you might also want to connect a Bluetooth mouse and headphones. Your budget may not let you pull a brand-new computer off the shelves, but you may not need to. Get a near-mint condition refurbished MacBook Air while it’s only $355. Sale ends February 23 at 11:59 p.m. PT. No coupon needed. Prices subject to change.
