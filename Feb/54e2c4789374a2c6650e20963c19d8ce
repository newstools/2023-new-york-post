Randi Martin, the mother of Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, was at a loss for words in late January, when her 27-year-old son helped punch Kansas City’s ticket to Super Bowl 2023 with a win over the Bengals in the AFC Championship game. “Words cannot describe my emotions,” Randi gushed on Instagram at the time. “I love my family more then [sic] anything #blessed.” Randi has cheered on Mahomes throughout his NFL career, which began in 2017 when he was selected 10th overall by the Chiefs. The former Texas Tech product has relied on his family’s support, especially during this year’s AFC playoff race, which included an injury in the Divisional Round. When Mahomes suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jaguars, the quarterback briefly exited the game, only to return in the second half to secure a 27-20 win for the Chiefs. A week later, Mahomes miraculously showed little sign of the injury affecting his performance as Kansas City edged out Cincinnati, 23-20. Mahomes’ father, Pat Mahomes, credited his ex-wife, whom he divorced in 2006, for their son’s remarkable durability. “His mama has some different genes,” Mahomes Sr., a former MLB pitcher, told The Washington Post in January. “She’s double-jointed and all that. He gets that from his mama. The athletic ability comes from me. That part comes from his mama.” In addition to Patrick Mahomes, Randi is a mother to son Jackson and daughter Mia. She has two grandchildren, Sterling Skye and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon III, whom Mahomes welcomed with his wife, Brittany Matthews. Randi grew up in Troup, Texas, a small town in the eastern part of the state that had a population of 2,006, per the 2020 census. She has an older brother and two older sisters, not to mention 56 first cousins, according to her bio on her website, QBproducer.com. She works as an event planner at the Hollytree Country Club in Tyler, Texas, and regularly attends church.
