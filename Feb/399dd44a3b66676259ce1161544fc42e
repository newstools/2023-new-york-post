A 17-year-old alleged gangbanger has been arrested over the shooting outside a Brooklyn high school that wounded two teenagers and a security guard last week, police sources said on Thursday. The teen — whose name is being withheld because he is a minor — is suspected of opening fire outside Williamsburg Charter High School on Feb. 8, leaving the 37-year-old guard with a bullet wound to the neck and two students, a boy and girl, with leg injuries. He is expected to be charged with multiple counts of attempted murder, according to the sources. The gunman fired off at least four 9 mm rounds during an afterschool melee, which the guard was trying to break up when the shots rang out — with the incident caught on cellphone video. The shooting at Varet and White Streets stemmed from a dispute between two street gangs — the Wortman Avenue Gantsas and the Road to Riches, according to the sources. Brooklyn detectives tracked down the suspected gunman — who was not a student at the charter school — using surveillance videos and eyewitness accounts, the sources said. He has a history of gun and robbery busts as a juvenile and is currently on probation for an unrelated weapons possession rap from August, according to sources. Video footage of the  shooting shows students screaming “Oh my God!” and running for cover inside the school, including the wounded teens and the guard. Police responded to the Varet Street school after receiving two 911 calls. Dozens of teens were fighting outside the school around 2 p.m. when the guard rushed over to intervene — before he heard the shots and realized he had been hit. He shuffled the teens into the building and called the cops, the sources said.
