A man and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested in connection to a shooting that injured nine children, including a 5-year-old, outside a gas station in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus police announced they arrested Dâ€™Angelo Robinson Sr., 35, and the teen, who was not named because of his age, following their investigation into the shooting at a Shell gas station on Feb. 17. Robinson is facing eight counts of aggravated assault and was booked into the Muscogee County Jail, Columbus Police said in a statement. The teen has been charged with one count of aggravated assault and was taken into custody at the Regional Youth Detention Center. Bullets began to fly after a fight from a nearby party spilled over to the gas station, Columbus Police Chief Freddie Blackmon said after the shooting. The 5-year-old shot was at the gas station with a family member, Blackmon said, adding that the others shot were a 12-year-old boy, two 13-year-old girls, a 13-year-old boy, a 14-year-old boy, two 15-year-old boys and a 17-year-old boy. All the victims were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and four were released from the hospital shortly after the shooting.
