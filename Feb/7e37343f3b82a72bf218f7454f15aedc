At least he didn’t try to carry a tune. President Biden invoked Aretha Franklin in rambling and confused response to a reporter who asked whether he planned to visit the site of a toxic trail derailment in Ohio. Biden made the remarks Friday afternoon while departing the White House for his vacation home in Wilmington, Del. His administration — in particular Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — have been accused of a sluggish response to the toxic chemical spill in East Palestine. “At this point, I’m not,” Biden said of any plans to visit. “I did a whole video, I mean, um, what the hell, on,” Biden said trailing off before a reporter jumped in. “Zoom?” “Zoom! All I can think of every time I think of Zoom is that song in my generation, Who’s Zoomin’ Who,” Biden said referring to the the 1985 Aretha Franklin hit. Former President Trump visited East Palestine Wednesday where he blasted Biden for being MIA during the crisis and handed out bottles of his own Trump-brand water. The visit was widely viewed as an early opening salvo in Trump’s 2024 reelection campaign, where he remains the dominant GOP frontrunner for the nomination. “President Trump is meeting with the citizens of East Palestine and he will never forget them and what they are going through. Contrast that with Biden and the federal government, who have failed them from the beginning.” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung told Breitbart News. Biden has defended his actions — including a decision to spend his time in Ukraine and Poland while Trump hit the domestic stump. “I had a long meeting with my team on what they are doing. You know, we were there two hours after the train went down — two hours,” Biden said. “And so, the idea that we’re not engaged is simply not there. In addition, there was not a request for me to go out, even before I was heading over to Kyiv,” Biden said.
