Serial liar George Santos’ days in the House are  numbered. But let’s be clear: His main victims are the people who elected him. His constituents already suffer from a dysfunctional district office (who’s going to work for this guy?) and the lack of whatever heft a normal representative (who hasn’t had to step down from his committee assignments, and can horse-trade with other reps) would have. Every day seems to bring some new revelation about his fabrications and . . . remarkable . . . past. If criminal charges don’t push him out first, the House ethics probe will surely force his ouster. Or maybe he’ll quit first — we assume he’s only hanging on for the paycheck. And voters who without question chose him for Congress simply because he ran as a Republican  (it was a wave election in New York anyway) will have to turn out again to stop Democrats from grabbing the seat back. Whenever he goes, Gov. Kathy Hochul will have 10 days to set a date for a special election between 70 and 80 days post-announcement. And “specials” usually favor Dems in this state, as their union-member, special-interest and activist base is at its most potent in such one-off affairs. Not to mention that Democrats will understandably aim to tie the GOP candidate to Santos in every way possible. Heck, the Republican machine in Nassau County deserves a slap for clearing the field for Santos. One thing is clear. Voters in the district want the liar out and a legit Republican in. Here’s hoping the GOP (local, state and national) can actually deliver on the voters’ will this time around.
