A historic Upper East Side townhouse known as the Mayflower House has hit the market for $14.99 million. Designed by architect John Payne, the stately five-story, five-bedroom limestone offering is 6,600 square feet and sits just off Park Avenue. In the 1920s, the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of New York bought the property at 120 E. 71st St. It was where the hereditary organization hosted quietly splashy events and housed their library. But by the time of the Great Depression, the society was forced to sell. The home was chopped up and remained a divided mess until around 2014, when prior owners restored the home to single-family status. They added features like a new staircase and floors, said Compass broker Maria Manuche, who shares the listing with colleague Clare Cukier. The home opens to a large reception room on the parlor floor with 12-foot ceilings, a gas-burning marble fireplace, a large bay window, black-and-white inlaid marble floors and a dramatic staircase — followed by living and dining rooms with herringbone floors, and a second gas-burning marble fireplace. Stairs and an elevator lead to a garden level that features an eat-in chef’s kitchen with a walk-in pantry, a media room and French doors that open to an irrigated landscaped garden for entertaining and alfresco dining. The main bedroom suite takes up the third floor and comes with its own terrace, two walk-in closets and a spa-like bath. Two large bedrooms with their own ensuite marble baths are on the fourth and fifth floors, while the basement boasts a gym and five wine refrigerators that can store a cool 1,000 bottles. The sellers are finance veteran David Puth and his wife Leslie, who bought the townhouse for $14.1 million in March 2014. Their children are grown and the pair is downsizing — but staying in the city, brokers say, and likely in the same neighborhood, which they love.
