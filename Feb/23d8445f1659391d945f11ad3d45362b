Readers: it’s winter. If you want ice, just look around. One of the most prolific ice makers in the world is up to his old tricks, and his name is The Big Man Upstairs. If you’ve never read much history, there was actually a time when He got so good at it, there was an entire age of ice, encompassing the whole world. They even made a couple of movies about it. But it won’t always be winter, and ice won’t always be so freely available. Soon enough, it’ll be summer, and you’ll need ice to chill your drinks or drop down your shirt. And the Big Man doesn’t make compromises; he won’t be around to help. Luckily, Amazon is. This week, the everything-under-the-sun retailer offers the Iceman Dual-Size Countertop Ice Machine for just $85 — the lowest price in 30 days. Treat yourselves, your guests, or the picnic or beach crowd, to either large or small ice bullets with the Dual-Size Countertop Ice Machine from Iceman, now 29% off on Amazon. Iceman is committed to giving ice-enjoyers the best of both worlds, creating an ice machine that’s small enough to fit on your countertop but large enough to store over a pound of ice at any given time. Plus, it works faster than your freezer. It may not seem like it now, but sooner or later, you’ll be begging for ice in your tea, and it won’t be on sale (this is how supply and demand works). Nab the Iceman today, and keep cool for the rest of the winter and beyond. For more content, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
