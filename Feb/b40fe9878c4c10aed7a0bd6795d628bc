A migrant tried to commit suicide at the city’s new shelter in Brooklyn on Tuesday, police said. The 26-year-old man was found suffering from self-inflicted stab wounds inside the recently opened shelter at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal around 2:15 p.m., cops said. The man used a shaving razor to cut his right forearm in one of the bathrooms of the housing facility, sources said. He was taken to Lutheran in stable condition. The Cruise Terminal mega-shelter opened in late January and houses up to 1,000 single adult migrant men. Last week, advocates and migrants who had been housed at Manhattan’s Watson Hotel protested the city’s decision to relocate single men to the Redhook facility to make room at the hotel for migrant families with children. Dozens of migrants had camped outside the Hell’s Kitchen hotel in protest for two nights following Adams’ announcement, with activists claiming the new Brooklyn shelter would not provide the single men the same services they had been receiving. Adams promised that the new facility would offer the same treatment as the Big Apple’s four other humanitarian relief centers. But migrants told The Post there was no privacy as all of the cots are packed together and showers are located outside the building.
