They were headed to Davy Jones’ locker. A TikTok has gone viral of Disneyland’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride sinking Saturday. Passengers were stranded on the ride for nearly an hour before they were rescued by emergency personnel. The video — which was posted by Justin James and has been viewed nearly 2 million times — shows the riders sitting in a boat as the water begins to rise. “POV: You’re stuck on the pirates ride @Disneyland and your boat is literally sinking,” reads the text in the video. The footage then cuts to the rising water level as the poster sticks his hand down in the liquid. “It was a hot mess. Honestly thought we were gonna swim our way out of this,” joked Justin. It was revealed later in the video that the passengers were shipwrecked until Disneyland firefighters arrived and helped them “walk the plank” to safety. “It’s giving Six Flags energy,” said the text in the video. The Post reached out to Disney Anaheim for comment. Several users floated their own opinions. “Damn full experience of pirates they even made you walk the plank,” joked one user. “Biggest fear is getting stuck in the huge room with the boats firing at each other,” said another. “Love this ride but this is my biggest fear,” chimed another user. “I was literally there yesterday and I did feel like the boats were a bit off. On the first fall the boat felt like it was going to turn over,” revealed a fourth user.
