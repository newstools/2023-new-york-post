Four cops shot a gun-wielding man after he assaulted a female stranger in the Bronx on Sunday afternoon, police said. The man’s 63-year-old victim approached officers around 2:20 p.m. and told them he had just hit her near East 153rd Street and Grand Concourse, authorities said. Five officers pursued the man, police said. “He refuses their orders to stop,” NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said at a news conference later Sunday near the scene. “As [the officers] continue to follow him, he displays a firearm and points it at a passer-by.’’ Chell said the officers gave “repeated instructions to drop the firearm. “He had the gun in his right hand, he rapidly turned toward them, they discharged their firearms,” the top cop said. Four of the police officers fired at the man, who was “shot numerous times in his body,” Chell said. Approximately 30 to 35 shell casings were found at the scene, a police source said. The man, whose identity wasn’t immediately released, was taken to Lincoln Hospital in critical condition. No police officers were shot. The woman was “struck by the male,” Chell said. The extent of her injuries were unknown. A firearm was recovered on the scene, police said. The officers were taken to Columbia Hospital for treatment of tinnitus, cops said. Chell asked anyone who saw what happened to call 1-800-577-TIPS. The shooting came a day after an off-duty police officer was shot while trying to buy a car that was listed on social media. He was struggling to survive Sunday.
