Kevin Love has his new team, and it will directly impact the Knicks’ quest to secure a top-six playoff seed and avoid the play-in tournament. The 34-year-old is signing with the Heat once he clears waivers following his contract buyout with the Cavaliers, he wrote on Twitter. He told former teammate Tristan Thompson, who reported the news on Twitter before Love confirmed it himself. “Yes sir my brother!!! Thank you for letting me bounce all of this off of you,” Love wrote in response to Thompson. “Heat Nation let’s go!!! The Cavaliers announced Saturday they were parting ways with Love, whose No. 0 will eventually be retired by the franchise, after nine seasons. The five-time All-Star, who helped the Cavs win their first-ever NBA title in 2016, was recently taken out of Cleveland’s rotation after averaging career-lows in points (8.5), rebounds (6.8) and minutes (20) over 41 games. ESPN reports that Love expects to “play a sizeable role” in the Heat’s frontcourt as they try solidifying their playoff position. Miami (32-27) is currently in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, half a game behind the Knicks (33-27) for the important No. 6 seed. The No. 7 seed has to face the No. 8 seed in the first round of the play-in tournament. The winner advances to the playoffs; the loser faces the winner of the No. 9 vs. No. 10 game to determine the final playoff entrant. ESPN reported Saturday that Love wanted to speak with the 76ers before making a final decision, but he ultimately chose Miami. “I’ll have more to say soon but want to get this off my chest. To the people of Cleveland and all of Ohio. I f–king LOVE you…and always will,” Love wrote Saturday on Twitter after the buyout. “Thank you for everything.” The Heat are also reportedly signing free-agent center Cody Zeller.
