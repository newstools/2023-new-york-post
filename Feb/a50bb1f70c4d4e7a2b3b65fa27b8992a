Any worries about Bo Horvat’s long-term future on Long Island can be wiped away. Horvat inked an eight-year, $68 million extension with the Islanders on Sunday, less than a week after the Islanders traded for him. The average annual value is $8.5 million, according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. That now gives the Islanders a 1-2 punch at center for the foreseeable future, since Mathew Barzal also signed a long-term extension at the start of this season. The 27-year-old Horvat, who will play his first game with the Isles on Monday in Philadelphia, centered Barzal in Sunday’s practice and may play there for the rest of this season. Josh Bailey completed the top line. The Islanders traded a package of Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty and a 2023 protected first-round pick to the Canucks for Horvat on Monday. Sunday, the day after the All-Star Game, was Horvat’s first practice with the team.
