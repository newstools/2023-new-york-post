This hotel had no reservations about showing one heartbroken guest some love. One woman is going viral on TikTok after sharing the random act of kindness that occurred while she was stranded in a hotel room, post-break up with her long-distance boyfriend. Essy, who goes by the username @Essyfromtheblock on the app, recounted the story in a viral video that has already climbed to over 2.4 million views. According to Essy’s account, her ex couldn’t even look at her after dumping her, so he booked her a hotel room before her flight left in the morning. But when she got there, crying and embarrassed, she learned the booking was made for the wrong night. That didn’t seem to matter to the attendants at the Hilton Doubletree Hotel in Montréal. The two women made Essy’s night by taking care of her, providing her with snacks and even a hand-written card. The Post reached out to Hilton and Essy for comment. “We broke up the night before my flight in the morning and he couldn’t even look at me so booked me a hotel,” Essy wrote over the clip, which begins with her disappointed stare into the camera lens. “He booked the wrong night and I thought I was screwed. I showed up crying and incredibly embarrassed. Until this happened.” The TikTok cut to a tray filled with snacks, candy and a card, before the camera panned to show two women in hotel uniforms, smiling and standing in her doorway. “Thank you so much to these girls, you guys have made my entire night, like look at how beautiful they are,” she said. Meanwhile, the women cheered her on in the background and told her that she doesn’t need a man. Essy then explained that the two ladies, one of whom was named Faith, gave her a discounted room, complementary snacks and the “warmest hug.” “Moments like this bring humanity back into my life,” Essy wrote in the video. “Thank you to Doubletree Hilton, but thank you most to Faith and her friend. Reminder that people make the company, and they made my entire night.” She even showed viewers a peek at the card, which said they wanted to give her a welcome gift to make her feel more at home, as they knew she was going through a breakup. Viewers on TikTok were touched by the endearing story. “In the end girls ALWAYS have your back, even if they don’t know you. ,” one user typed. Another agreed, commenting, “I love strangers showing up for strangers on a hard day and reminding them that kindness is still alive and well in the world.” One person even claimed the video made them shed a tear. “Bless those girls their energy is so pure and loving  this made me tear up!!!” they wrote. Hilton Hotels also chimed-in on the video, writing, “These are the moments we live for bestie! better believe we have already shared this with their leadership team #HiltonForTheStay.” Despite her dramatic breakup, in a follow-up video, Essy insisted that there’s no animosity between her and the ex — who ended up paying for the new room, too.
