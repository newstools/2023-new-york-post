When Beyoncé tied the record for the most Grammy wins ever, she was — in true diva fashion — late showing up to the awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. But seriously, CBS, weren’t they supposed to wait for her to arrive? Still, when Viola Davis — who had already made history herself by becoming an EGOT by winning a Grammy for Best Audio Book, Narration, and Storytelling for the audio book of her memoir, “Finding Me” — presented the award for Best R&B Song to a no-show Beyoncé while she was still stuck in L.A. traffic on her way to the Crypto.com Arena, it was one of the all-time diva moments. Until the 2023 Grammys, Beyoncé was tied with Quincy Jones at 28 wins. Now, she’s tied with the late orchestra conductor Georg Solti, the most decorated musician in Grammy Awards history. But the legendary Nile Rodgers, who co-wrote and plays guitar on “Cuff It,” helped to make up for it with an emotional speech that made it all good. At least until Beyoncé finally showed up!
