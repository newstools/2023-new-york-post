Paige Spiranac is in party-planning mode. During Tuesday’s episode of her “Playing A Round” podcast, the golf influencer was asked about her upcoming 30th birthday and revealed she’s toying with the idea of a prom-themed party. “I don’t know yet, we’ve thrown around some ideas. So, I’ve never been to prom, ever, and we thought it’d be fun to do a prom-themed 30th birthday,” Spiranac said. “I think that would be something that’s really fun.” Although Spiranac joked that she wanted to “cry about being old,” the 29-year-old shared how bringing her prom-themed bash to life could be challenging. “It’s hard because I do travel so much that a lot of friends that I have don’t live in the state that I live in, so logistically getting everyone together will probably be the hardest part,” she said. “So, if we can’t do that, then I’m going to force [co-host] Sam [Marks] to come here and we will just party in our prom dresses.” Spiranac is coming off of a busy few weeks that included a stint as a Super Bowl correspondent for “Inside Edition,” where she was on the ground in Arizona for the big game. Spiranac also took in the Waste Management Phoenix Open this month. “What happens at the WM, ends up on social media,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself modeling a white crop top and jeans from the 16th hole. Though Spiranac will soon be turning the page to the next decade, her twenties have certainly been a memorable ride. In the last year alone, Spiranac was named the “Sexiest Woman Alive” by Maxim and covered the magazine in June. “It’s such an honor and I still, to this day, I look at the magazine and I’m like, ‘That’s not me, I can’t believe this happened,'” Spiranac told The Post of the nod in September. Last month, Spiranac also launched her subscription-based site, “OnlyPaige,” which features golf instruction, live streams, and exclusive photos, among other content.
