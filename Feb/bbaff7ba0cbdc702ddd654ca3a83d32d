A Bronx car-wash worker was killed in a hit-run crash early Sunday when an SUV driver on the street smashed into the sedan he was drying, police said. The 55-year-old worker was standing near the sedan at the exit of the business at 1181 Webster Ave. around 5:45 a.m. when a black Ford SUV with two women inside crashed into it, cops said. “The sedan and the employee are struck by the SUV,” a police spokesman said. “Two females flee from the SUV on foot.” The sedan’s driver was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with injuries but was expected to survive. The worker was pronounced dead at Lincoln Hospital. Cops were still searching for the two females who ran away from the vehicle on Webster Avenue.
