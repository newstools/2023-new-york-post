Observers in Conway, South Carolina posted video of what appeared to be two US fighter jets circling the Chinese spy balloon as it neared the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean Saturday. The 21-second clip from the Charleston Post and Courier showed the aircraft’s contrails against a bright blue sky over the town, located 15 miles northeast of Myrtle Beach. The Federal Aviation Administration shut down three airports in North and South Carolina Saturday afternoon and closed the airspace over Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Wilmington, due to “national security initiatives.” The US military apparently shot down the balloon Saturday afternoon, as video showed the deflated object dropping into the Atlantic Ocean 10 miles below.
