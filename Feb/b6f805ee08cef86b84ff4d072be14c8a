Tom Brady apparently sat on his retirement video for a bit before releasing it. NFL Network reporter Peter Schrager spilled the tea Wednesday morning after the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback announced his retirement in a self-shot beach video. “Per sources close to Brady, the video posted this AM was filmed prior to this morning,” Schrager tweeted. “Kept this one awfully quiet.” He expanded on the scoop on “Good Morning Football.” “That was filmed a while ago,” Schrager said on the program, as covered by Mass Live. “He was at an L.A. premiere last night, doing the movie premiere [for “80 for Brady”]. The sun is not up in L.A. as you see there. So that is a taping, that means he has known this and has kept this quiet for at least 48 hours.” Brady in the video can come off as giving the impression that it was shot on Wednesday. “So when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d press record and let you guys know first,” Brady says in the clip. On Wednesday, Brady’s father, Tom Brady Sr., told the Boston Globe that his son revealed his retirement plans to his parents about a week ago. “We’re not shocked by any means,” Brady Sr. told the outlet on Wednesday. “He has played football for 32 years out of his 45, living his dream for three-fourths of his life. It’s been a wonderful ride. He’s very secure in his decision. It’s about time.” Brady also briefly retired last offseason, but reporters who have spoken to those close to the quarterback are emphatic he will not mount another comeback. “So ultimately, I will be very clear on this, everybody is telling me that he is done-done. This is not going to be a reconsideration,” ESPN NFL insider Jeff Darlington said on-air. “He is done. He feels at peace with it. He is ready to move on with his life away from football.”
