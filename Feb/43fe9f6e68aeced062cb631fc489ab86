Conor McGregor’s return to the octagon took a major step forward. Saturday morning, UFC boss Dana White announced that McGregor and Michael Chandler will coach against each other on the forthcoming season of “The Ultimate Fighter” — and that after that they will have a fight of their own. White did not reveal a date or location for the fight, but said that details will be announced “soon.” The bout will most likely take place at 170 pounds. This will be McGregor’s first fight in the octagon since he broke his leg in a bout against Dustin Poirier in July 2021. Chandler is 2-3 since coming over from Bellator in 2021 The 34-year-old McGregor has remained near-constantly in the news despite the absence from fighting. Last week, he said on Instagram that he had been struck by a car while biking. “I could’ve been dead there, mate, look,” McGregor said in the video. McGregor also faced allegations in January that he assaulted a woman on his yacht in Spain last summer. The unidentified woman reportedly told police in Ireland that she “feared for her life,” and that he kicked her and punched her in the face. She also alleged that he threatened to drown her. Through a spokesperson, McGregor denied the allegations. “Over six months ago an incident was alleged and after a police review, the matter was not pursued. Mr. McGregor is steadfast in his denial of all the accusations made by a guest on his boat,” the spokesperson said in a statement. It was a busy morning for UFC announcements; the promotion also revealed that UFC 287 will take place in Miami on April 8, and will feature co-main events: Gilbert Burns versus Jorge Masvidal, plus a rematch between Alex Pereira and Israel Adesanya.
