An off-duty MTA cop was dragged off a Manhattan subway train and pummeled by a stranger — who apparently went berserk all because the victim was looking at him, police said. The 26-year-old officer was on a southbound No. 4 train at 7:45 a.m. Saturday when the brute walked up to him and grabbed him by the collar of his jacket, cops said. “What are you looking at?” the suspect hissed, a police spokeswoman said. When the train entered the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station, the stranger “dragged the victim to the platform floor and punched him several times in the face,” according to police. The attacker fled on foot. The off-duty cop was taken to a local hospital and treated for bruises and swelling to his right eye and cheek, cops said. Cops are now hunting for the suspect, who was captured on surveillance cameras inside the subway system, authorities said. “We are working closely with the NYPD, which has good pictures of this perpetrator from MTA cameras,” the transit agency said in a statement. The MTA Police Benevolent Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post on Sunday. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

The incident comes on the heels of attacks on two off-duty Big Apple law-enforcement officers in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an off-duty NYPD officer, Adeed Fayaz, was shot and mortally wounded during a botched robbery attempt in Brooklyn. Last month, an off-duty NYPD traffic agent was robbed at knifepoint at a Brownsville subway station in Brooklyn.
