After eight years in the NFL for Byron Jones, it appears he won’t see a ninth. On Saturday, the Miami Dolphins cornerback opened up on Twitter, indicating he won’t be returning to the game due to various injuries and poor recovery guidance in the league. “Much has changed in 8 years,” Jones tweeted. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game. DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.” His tweet also shares a warning to current NFL players. “It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones continued in the thread. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities. Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.” This announcement was a quote tweet of a 2015 post from the NFL’s verified account, which featured a GIF of Jones, calling him “Mr. Broad Jump” because of an impressive feat he accomplished at the NFL Combine that year. He jumped 12 feet and three inches long, which the GIF showed is longer than two 2015 Mini Coopers put together at 11 feet and six inches. Jones, 30, was on the physically unable to perform list throughout the 2022 season, as he was sidelined by Achilles and ankle injuries. He underwent surgery prior to the season. It seems, under Jones’ wishes, he will retire or be released by the Dolphins prior to next season. Jones was drafted in the first round (27th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys out of UConn. He spent five years with the Cowboys, totaling two interceptions, one touchdown, and 349 total tackles. He spent the past two years with the Dolphins.
