SOS at the SAGs. Hundreds of guests were supposedly left stranded outside the Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles Sunday evening as the show kicked off. Bill Murray, Claire Foy and Rooney Mara were amongst the star-studded crowd left waiting for the green light to enter the venue after a fire marshal supposedly blocked the entrance. However, Mara’s representative told The Post that the hold-up was just due to overcrowding and that no one was locked out from the ceremony. “Not a single actor was barred entry into the SAG Awards,” her representative said. “There was a delay upon entry to clear the carpet due to overcrowding however no one was barred, including Rooney.” However, videos posted to Twitter by Variety’s co-editor-in-chief, Ramin Setoodeh, showed the “madness.” “Even Bill Murray has to wait,” he wrote along with another clip that showed Foy and Mara waiting in line for entry. “Total chaos at the #SAGAwards as Claire Foy and Rooney Mara are not being allowed inside the ballroom of the Fairmont Hotel — they’re told they need to wait for the Fire Marshal to let them (and hundreds of other guests) inside,” Setoodeh tweeted. The Post has reached out to reps for Murray and Foy for comment. Thankfully, the two actresses entered in time to make a fleeting appearance on stage, alongside Jessie Buckley, to present Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, which went to Ke Huy Quan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”). Earlier in the evening, “Dead to Me” star Christina Applegate arrived at SAG Awards, which are streamed on Netflix’s YouTube channel this year. It marked a big night for the 51-year-old actress who previously hinted that it could be her last award show after her multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Her cane read, “FU MS” on the red carpet while accompanied by her daughter, Sadie Grace, 12.
