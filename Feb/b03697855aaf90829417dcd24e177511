PHOENIX – Jets owner Woody Johnson is optimistic that the team will be able to land an impact quarterback this offseason. “That’s an issue,” Johnson said Thursday night of the quarterback position. “That’s the issue right now. The issue is quarterback performance and also running the ball. We have to have a balanced offense.” Johnson, who attended NFL Honors on Thursday, was asked if he is optimistic they can land a difference maker. “I’m always optimistic,” he said. The Jets have been open about their desire to land a veteran quarterback after going through three starters at the position in 2022. Johnson said last month he “absolutely” would pay a veteran quarterback if Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh want to add one. If the Packers and Aaron Rodgers decide to part ways, the Jets are expected to be very interested in trading for him. Other veteran options include Derek Carr, Jimmy Garoppolo and Ryan Tannehill if the Titans cut him. Jets Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath reiterated what he said on WFAN a few weeks back about allowing Rodgers to wear his retired No. 12 if he comes to the Jets. “I want the Jets to win,” Namath said. Namath said he is a fan of Rodgers. “Everybody is,” Namath said. “Chicago may not like Aaron. He’s a great player.” Namath has seen the Jets chase his successor for more than 40 years now and believes the Jets are close to being a contender if they add the right quarterback. “I think we’re pretty good on both sides of the ball if Lady Luck doesn’t knock us out like it did this year with the offensive line and the running back, and we stay healthy,” Namath said. “We need a trigger guy.”
