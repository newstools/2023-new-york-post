Subway crime dropped by nearly 30% last month as the city rides the momentum from the final weeks of 2022, new data shows. The NYPD recorded 145 major felonies on the underground in January, down from 205 over the same period in 2022, according to police data obtained by The Post. Thatâ€™s also nearly half the tally of January 2020, when cops logged 261 major crimes. The largest decrease was in grand larcenies, with a 44% dip from 97 to 54. Robbery also saw a 20% drop from 58 to 46. There were three fewer felony assaults on the subway system recorded last month compared to the prior year, 43 vs 46. The decrease comes just days after Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul credited the subway safety plan that flooded the system with cops last October for reducing the rate of crime on the rails.
