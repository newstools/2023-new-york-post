Former Nets guard Kyrie Irving is reportedly “ecstatic” and “looking forward” to joining Luka Doncic and the Mavericks following the Nets trading him to Dallas on Sunday, according to TNT and Bleacher Report insider Chris Haynes. The Mavericks had reportedly grappled with whether the pair of stars would mesh in the same lineup, per The Athletic, but it appears Dallas has arrived at its conclusion — sending Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected 2029 first-round selection and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029 to Brooklyn, The Post’s Brian Lewis confirmed. The Irving deal prompted reactions from across the league, with players, such as Dinwiddie, weighing in on the major deal ahead of the NBA’s trade deadline Thursday. “When @ShamsCharania says it’s time to go you pack your bags. Plus Elijah said he wanted to go back home,” Dinwiddie tweeted, along with emojis of a smiling face and praying hands. Elijah is Dinwiddie’s son. Dinwiddie, who played for the Nets from 2016-2021, also tweeted at Mavericks fans and wrote that Dallas and Brooklyn have “made my NBA experience. Nothing but immaculate vibes as [Theo Pinson] would say.” Hawks star Trae Young weighed on the trade that takes Irving out of the Eastern Conference, where Atlanta could possibly face the Nets in the postseason or compete with them for seeding. “The NBA gonna NBA.. it’s that time of year,” Young wrote. “Wow!” Center Andre Drummond, whose Bulls face the Nets on Thursday at the Barclays Center, chimed in and added, “Ladies and Gentleman welcome to the trade deadline.” Even a pair of NFL players weighed in. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was born in Tyler, Texas, tweeted, “Hold up!! Let’s go!!” with three flexing bicep emojis — firing off the message on Twitter a few minutes before Kansas City’s flight arrived in Glendale, Ariz. for Super Bowl 2023. Texans wideout Phillip Dorsett also added, “Kyrie and Luka in Dallas” with a flame emoji.
