Sarah Michelle Gellar finally confirmed the rumor that Dolly Parton was a producer on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” While appearing on “The Tonight Show,” Gellar, 45, told the world that the suspicions were true. “Little-known fact: The legend, Dolly Parton, was a producer,” Gellar told Jimmy Fallon, 48. Parton, 77, was an uncredited producer on the hit sci-fi series that ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003 — but the cast never got to see her. “We never saw her. We’d get Christmas gifts in the beginning that would have her name, and I would think, ‘She doesn’t know who I am,’” Gellar, who played the show’s titular character, Buffy Summers, shared. But the “9 to 5” singer did, in fact, know who she was. “Then one day, someone asked her about it, and she complimented the show and my performance,” Gellar continued. “And I was like, ‘Oh, I can die now. Dolly Parton knows who I am and thinks I’m good.’” The Post revealed Parton’s side gig back in 2020, though it was never confirmed by anyone in the show’s cast at that point. Parton and the late Sandy Gallin co-founded Sandollar Productions in 1986, which produced “Buffy” and the “Angel” spinoff series, as well as the original film version of “Buffy.” The ‘90s show was based on the 1993 film of the same name, which starred Kristy Swanson. Gellar recently shared that though she’s “very proud of the show,” she would not be interested in a “Buffy” reboot.
