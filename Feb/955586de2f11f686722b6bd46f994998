She’s being so real. A TikToker revealed the most “savage” way to break up with a boyfriend: Post it on BeReal. Jules Dall admitted in a viral clip that midway through the couple’s split, she snapped a photo on the popular app BeReal, which allows users to post one photo per day — simultaneously using both the front and back cameras — at random times every day. “Posting a BeReal while giving my ex his stuff back,” she wrote in the clip, which was backed by the Dragonette song “Hello” and already amassed 2.2 million views. In the photo shared in the video, the back camera captured the moment she reportedly returned all of her ex’s belongings that she had been hanging onto. She also shared screenshots of her friends’ reactions, many of which showed their surprised faces. Users in the comments commended the ex for agreeing to be featured in the photo, while others were simply shocked. “Go him for being a team player for the BeReal,” wrote one person. “Jules!” added someone else. “This is the savagery I’m here for!” “This gives me life,” chuckled another. “This was hilarious,” agreed one person. “SLAYED,” championed another. “HAHAH GIRL BOSS,” applauded someone else. While it isn’t revenge per se, it isn’t the first time someone’s publicly aired out their ex’s dirty laundry online. One woman laced her cheating boyfriend’s condoms with habanero oil, while another doused her ex’s home in glitter. Other women have shared the unfortunate aftermaths of their break-ups on TikTok, including being forced to vacation with them on a non-refundable trip.
