The newest tenant at Rudin’s “reimagined” 80 Pine Street is nonprofit Vibrant Emotional Health, which just signed for nearly 60,000 square feet — nearly doubling its current space at 50 Broadway from which it will move later this year. The asking rent was in the mid-$50s per square foot. Rudin’s 1.2 million square-foot tower has seen about 200,000 square feet in new leases, expansions and renewals over the past year. Vibrant has actively promoted emotional well-being for more than 50 years. It is the administrator of the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline) and the national Disaster Distress Hotline, among other services. Rudin has worked with Fogarty Finger Architecture in renovating 80 Pine Street’s ground-floor spaces which now feature white terrazzo flooring, white oak paneled walls, energy efficient LED lighting and new elevator cabs. A new amenities center will soon be finished on the 22nd and 23rd floors.
