Adriana Kuch, who tragically took her own life two days after being beaten by high school bullies, was seen in a new video saving the life of a little girl. Adriana, 14, rushed to the aid of the child, who was struggling in a neighbor’s pool, according to the “Today” show, which posted the undated video clip. She can be seen placing something on a chair before dashing into the pool and jumping in. Adriana took her own life on Feb. 3 in her Berkeley Township home hours after she received a message mocking her for getting her “a— whooped,” her father has said. Four fellow students have been charged in the savage attack against her in their high school hallway on Feb. 1. An obituary posted for the teen said she “adored all animals, she helped children with special needs, she loved jogging with her brothers and was a true nature lover. Adriana also enjoyed her walks in the woods, skateboarding, riding dune buggies and dirt bikes.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.
