“Pineapple Express” star Seth Rogen is organizing a sleepover with an elevated itinerary. As part of a promotion for his cannabis and homewares company, Houseplant, Rogen is inviting fans to stay over at a California property stocked with a variety of the company’s wares. Rogen, 40, will be present for all three of the one-night stays set to take place this month at the Los Angeles home, which is his “his creative retreat,” according to press materials. The sleek modern space is outfitted with midcentury-modern furniture, Rogen’s own ceramic creations, a yard, “a thoughtful selection of plants,” a fully stocked fridge and a pottery wheel. “During your stay, you will get a glimpse into my creative process,” reads the bio on Airbnb, which is purportedly written by Rogen himself. “I don’t know what’s more of a Houseplant vibe than a creative retreat at a mid-century Airbnb filled with our Housegoods, a pottery wheel, and incredible views of LA,” Rogen noted in the release. “Add me, and you’ll have the ultimate experience.” After all, as the company’s founder, “I AM HOUSEPLANT!!!” he declared. During his time with guests, activities will include receiving pointers from the “Sausage Party” actor while making pottery, enjoying the building’s outdoor space together and listening to a collection of Houseplant record sets, including “specially curated track lists inspired by different cannabis strains.” Guests will be sent home with a goodie bag of “Houseplant favorites,” including a vinyl box set. Despite the marijuana pun-heavy press materials, the fine print makes clear that “No cannabis-based products will be made available or provided to the guests during the stays.” The three sleepovers will take place this Feb. 15, 16 and 17 and cost an affordable $42 a night. Booking opens on Feb. 7 at 1 p.m. Pacific time.
