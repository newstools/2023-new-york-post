In an era of inflated prices, concessions at Super Bowl 2023 seem to have stayed constant. Folks having a beer and a snack at the big game between between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. will pay prices in line with those of previous games. A burger with fries will set fans back $12, while chicken strips and fries are $13. Nachos are going for $11, while a bratwurst is $12 — though an all-beef hot dog is $8. Only want the fries? That’ll be $9. Those that truly want to get into the local spirit can snag a Big AZ Dog with chili and cheese for $15. Snackers can expect to fork over $7 for peanuts or $5 for candy. Popcorn is $7.50, though an extra $1.50 will bring an upgrade to kettlecorn. A bag of chips is $4. Even a Gatorade or bottled water will only be a $6.50 spend — though a souvenir soda (to prove you really drank a carbonated beverage at Super Bowl 2023) is a hefty $12.
