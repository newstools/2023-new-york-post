Embattled FDNY boss Laura Kavanagh named a decorated, retired former assistant chief as her first deputy commissioner on Saturday. The commissioner, who is currently facing a mutiny by her top chiefs welcomed back Joseph Pfeifer, who retired in 2018 after 37 years at the FDNY. His long career included being the first battalion chief to arrive at the north tower to set up communications after the attacks. Insiders say the move ensures there’s firefighting experience among the top ranks of the FDNY as  Kavanagh, 40, has none. The 67-year-old Pfeifer will manage the day-to-day operations and activities of the FDNY across all offices and bureaus. “Chief Joe Pfeifer embodies what it means to be New York’s Bravest, being the first chief to respond to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 and founding the department’s Center for Terrorism and Disaster Preparedness,” Mayor Adams said in a statement. “With nearly 40 years of experience with the FDNY, he is an excellent choice to assume one of the highest-ranking positions in this great department and is someone that New Yorkers and firefighters can count on to innovate in all aspects of fire prevention and safety.” “Having already worked closely with Joe for many years, I am thrilled he has returned home to the FDNY and joined our executive leadership team.” the FDNY commissioner said. Before being named acting fire commissioner last February and then being appointed to the post permanently in October, Kavanagh served as first deputy commissioner under her predecessor Daniel Nigro, earning $242,767 at the time. Pfeifer — who lost his brother Kevin, an FDNY lieutenant during the 9/11 rescue efforts — said in a statement he’s glad to be back. “The heart of FDNY is the ability to unify efforts to solve complex problems in the face of great tragedy,” he said. “Our united team is a sign of resilience to reflect on the past and envision the future so that we can enhance the present.”
