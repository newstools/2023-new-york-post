Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene took a below-the-belt shot at one of her congressional colleagues Friday in a spicy Twitter exchange. The Georgia Republican invoked Rep. Eric Swalwell’s (D-Calif.) purported dalliance with suspected Chinese honeytrap Christine Fang, aka Fang Fang, after the California Democrat made a bawdy joke at the expense of Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), who has spent the week passing out AR-15-shaped lapel pins to pro-Second Amendment House members. “Why is it so small?” Swalwell said in a tweet aimed at Clyde, who showed off the pins Thursday in a video posted on the social media platform. To which Greene responded: “Questions only Fang Fang can answer.” Swalwell was booted from the House Intelligence Committee last week by Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) over his personal relationship with the suspected Chinese secret agent. The 42-year-old Democrat has refused to say how intimate things got with Fang, but intelligence officials have said she had sex with at least two Midwestern mayors as she tried to get information from them. Fang reportedly left the country in mid-2015 amid a federal investigation into her alleged espionage. In a separate tweet, Greene joked that the Chinese surveillance balloon revealed to be floating over the US on Thursday was an early Valentine’s Day gesture to Swalwell. The 48-year-old Georgia Republican shared a photoshopped image of the device emblazoned with a “Happy Valentine’s Day” message to “Eric” signed “Love Fang Fang.” “Don’t we have lasers to shoot that down?” Swalwell said in response to the balloon tweet, a reference to a conspiracy theory shared by Greene on Facebook in 2018 in which she suggested that the Rothschilds, a prominent Jewish banking family, shot “lasers or blue beams of light” from space to spark deadly California wildfires and profit off of the devastation.
