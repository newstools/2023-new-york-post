The Super Bowl is finally here and it provides so many betting opportunities, whether it be traditional bets like the spread or the over/under, or prop bets. There are so many prop bets to choose from for the big game and one that stands out to me involves Eagles backup running back Kenneth Gainwell. Unless you’re a Philadelphia fan or a hardcore fantasy football player, you probably don’t know who he is, but he could play a big role in today’s game. FanDuel Sportsbook has Gainwell’s rushing yards total at 19.5 yards with -110 odds. I am taking the over on his yardage total with no hesitation. Gainwell has been a key supplemental piece to the Eagles offense on their championship run, rushing for 112 yards and a touchdown in the divisional round against the New York Giants and recorded 48 rushing yards in Philadelphia’s win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. All he has to do this time is just rush for 20 yards. That really does not seem like much of an ask for the Eagles’ No. 2 running back.
