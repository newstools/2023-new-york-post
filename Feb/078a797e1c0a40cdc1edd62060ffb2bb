It’s a moment Erin Andrews won’t soon forget. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Fox’s lead NFL sideline reporter shared a series of snapshots of her postgame interview with Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, moments after Kansas City defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2023 on Feb. 12. “Inside that @nflonfox Super Bowl postgame interview. A freaking pinch me moment!” the 44-year-old Andrews captioned the post. Despite re-aggravating an ankle injury, Mahomes carried the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory in his third Super Bowl appearance and was named MVP. Shortly after the game, Mahomes made his way over to Andrews for the interview, where he lauded the team effort. “It didn’t come from one person,” the 27-year-old quarterback said. “Our defense played their ass off in that second half. And our offense found a way. Man, I just wanna thank everybody.” Kelce, 33, then joined the postgame Q&A and wasted no time calling out the Chiefs’ apparent doubters. “Not one of y’all said the Chiefs were gonna take it home this year,” Kelce shouted. “Not a single one.” Mahomes threw for 182 yards and three touchdowns in the game, with Kelce hauling in an 18-yard pass to put the Chiefs on the board in Kansas City’s opening drive. Though Fox’s top team of Andrews, Greg Olsen and Kevin Burkhardt delivered on Super Bowl Sunday, in the days leading up to the game, the WEAR by Erin Andrews founder revealed that dropping an F-bomb on-air is one of her biggest fears. “It’s a massive fear — massive, massive,” Andrews said on a recent episode of her “Calm Down” podcast with Charissa Thompson. When asked by Thompson, who also works for Fox Sports, if she has ever “done it on accident,” Andrews replied, “Oh my God, no. I am knocking on everything.”
