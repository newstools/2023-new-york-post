The former NYPD officer found dead in an apparent murder-suicide appeared to have been “living her best life” in retirement. Petlyn Job, 49, shot her boyfriend, Alex Delone, 52, before killing herself in her Flatbush home Friday, sources told The Post. The single mother of three, had a gunshot wound under the jaw, while Delone was shot in the head, police said. Job, who retired from the NYPD in September 2021, posted numerous photos to social media of her travels and time spent with her family. Her youngest child, a daughter, is just 12. In August, she posted a photo of herself in uniform at a 2018 concert with singer Allison Hinds. “THESE WERE THE GOOD OLE’ DAYS…I SURE MISS THESE OPPORTUNITIES & RUNNING INTO CELEBRATIES [sic] EVERY NOW & THEN WHEN I WAS WORKING BUT…I’M SURE ENJOYING MY RETIREMENT & LIVING MY BEST LIFE A LOT BETTER!!!,” Job wrote. Later that month, she shared snaps of an Alicia Keys concert and then of a trip to Morocco to celebrate her 49th birthday. “AUGUST IS MY BIRTHDAY MONTH & I’M JUST HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE,” she wrote in one post. She also shared a photo of her dining with Delone in April saying “out to dinner with my love.” Delone’s nephew, Josue Delone, 19, said the family was shattered by the tragedy and his uncle — who has a 21-year-old daughter — was a “gentle man.” “If he had a problem or trouble anytime, he’d come through with a solution. He’d have a way to resolve it peacefully,” Josue said. “I know for a fact that my uncle would never do something like that. He wouldn’t have started anything. I never heard him raise his voice at anybody.” He said he didn’t know about any problems in the relationship between Delone, who was originally from Haiti and had a business selling used cars, and Job. “He was a beautiful human soul,” said Delone’s father, Rodrigue Delone. Job’s father, Orville Job, was too distraught to speak. The family is from Trinidad and Tobago where Petlyn was born. “My cousin was a wonderful person, a dedicated police officer,” Aisha McKain said. “She lived and loved life. She was full of life. Everything about her was about love and life.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling.
