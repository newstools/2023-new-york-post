Eagle-eyed viewers have called out an embarrassing editing error in the latest episode of the hit HBO series “The Last of Us.” The post-apocalyptic drama, which has earned rave reviews from critics, follows two survivors of a fungus pandemic that turns infected people into zombie-like creatures. The sixth episode of the show aired Sunday, showing the pair traversing the snowy wilderness of Wyoming — only they weren’t alone. Viewer Chase Osborne took to TikTok to share a screenshot that showed a film crew clearly visible in one scene filmed overhead by a drone. “About 15 minutes in. They might have accidentally left a few of the film crew in the shot,” Osborne captioned his viral video, which garnered more than 216,000 views. Dozens of other TikTok users took to the comments section saying they had also noticed the error. “HBO editors are always slacking,” one wrote. “How do these multi-million dollar productions miss this stuff? I’m more precious with my 5-minute YouTube drone video,” another exasperated viewer declared. Meanwhile, several others claimed that the awkward moment was reminiscent of another infamous editing error that came from HBO. Back in 2019, the network was left red-faced when an anachronistic coffee cup was featured in an episode of “Game of Thrones.” However, other viewers defended the editors of “The Last of Us,” saying the show was so engrossing that they simply didn’t notice the minor mistake. “I was too distracted looking at the pretty view rather than picking on the minor issues they missed,” one defender declared. “Bro, who’s looking at the edges of the screen?” another asked. “The Last of Us” is based on the best-selling 2013 video game of the same name, and follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they travel across the US in the wake of a fungus pandemic that has destroyed society. The series has been a smash hit for HBO, bringing in more than 7.5 million viewers on cable and millions more via streamer HBO Max.
