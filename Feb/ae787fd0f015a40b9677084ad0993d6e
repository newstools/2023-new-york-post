A Virginia high school’s girls basketball coach is under investigation after an altercation with a spectator during a game on Thursday. Richlands head coach Tom Rife was captured on video jumping over the team’s bench and confronting a male spectator during the final seconds of his team’s 54-51 loss to Wise Central. In videos from the incident, which circulated on social media, Rife appeared angry while shoving the man repeatedly. Rife was dressed in a blue shirt, while the other man was wearing a white t-shirt. At one point, Rife waved his arm, appearing to summon others over to the scene. The coach and spectator seemingly exchanged words before multiple people, including a male security guard, who eventually intervened and separated the two. Video footage shows Rife and the man being escorted to opposite ends of the court. It’s unclear if they were removed from the game. The contest took place at Richlands Middle School gymnasium and was part of the Lady Blue Tornado’s Region 2D girls basketball tournament. Tazewell County Public Schools has launched an investigation into the incident. “We are aware of the incident at the RHS girls basketball game and while we do not condone any misconduct from our coaches or spectators at this time we are still investigating the actions of all parties involved,” Superintendent Dr. Christopher Stacy said in a statement on Friday. The investigation will be conducted by Stacy, Deputy Superintendent Diedra Hill, Richlands High School Principal Rickie Vencill and Richlands Athletic Director Frank Daugherty, according to the Bluefield Daily Telegraph. Rife coached girls and boys basketball at Richlands from the late 1970s through 2005, the outlet reported. He previously served as the school’s athletic director. Rife reportedly took over as head coach for the Richlands girls basketball program this year after acting head coach, Aaron Lowe, was dismissed in August following seven seasons as coach of the Lady Blue Tornados.
