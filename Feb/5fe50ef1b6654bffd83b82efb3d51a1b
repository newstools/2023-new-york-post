Even stars in other professional sports leagues were frustrated with the crucial defensive holding call in the final minutes of Super Bowl 2023 between the Chiefs and Eagles. Lakers star LeBron James sounded off on Twitter after Eagles cornerback James Bradberry was flagged for defensive holding on Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, extending Kansas City’s drive and essentially allowing the Chiefs to ice the game. “Sorry but I don’t like that call! Not for the Super Bowl man!” James tweeted, alongside a facepalm emoji, after referee Carl Cheffers flagged Bradberry on a crucial third-down play. On the play, Bradberry appeared to tug the outside of Smith-Schuster’s jersey as he began to run upfield – but to many observers, it looked like incidental contact that shouldn’t have been flagged on the game’s most important play. “His hand on his back had no effect on his route! This game was too damn good for that call to dictate the outcome at the end. Damn! By the way I have no horse in the race. Just my professional opinion,” James, who was at the game and getting booed by NFL fans, wrote in a second tweet. The call gave Kansas City a fresh set of downs with less than two minutes remaining in the game, allowing the Chiefs to call two run plays, then kneel the ball and get the clock under  10 seconds before kicking a go-ahead field goal. Had the penalty not been called and Patrick Mahomes’ pass was ruled incomplete, quarterback Jalen Hurts and the Eagles would have had almost two minutes to drive the length of the field and kick a field goal to tie the game. However, it was not meant to be. Bradberry, for his part, admitted that he did hold Smith-Schuster in the bang-bang play. “I tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide,” the former Giants cornerback said after the game.
