Babies: you can’t live with ’em, you can’t live without ’em. Don’t believe us? Consider a few examples. They have terrible table manners, and are often not particularly good conversationalists. If you had one as a roommate you would have to be constantly apologizing to guests: “Sorry, my roommate is really loud and also can’t bathe himself.” On the flip side, they’re the future of the human race, and they tend to be super cute and nothing suits them better than a well-fitted diaper. Unfortunately, those can add up. Related: the best baby shower gifts. Luckily, Amazon is hosting a sale offering up to 34% off of Huggies Diapers and Wipes Bundles of all sizes.
