Vanity Fair unveiled its annual Hollywood cover on Wednesday, and the sexy young stars of “Bridgerton,” “Blonde,” “Don’t Worry Darling” and more reveal what it’s like to be the hottest things on the A-list. Ana de Armas, who is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress this year, said she sees a lot of herself in her “Blonde” bombshell character, Marilyn Monroe. “She’s just an actress trying to navigate life and this system, which is so hard to navigate for anybody,” the 34-year-old Cuban Spanish stunner said. Previously, De Armas played a Bond girl in “No Time To Die,” while another actor on VF’s list is rumored to be the next 007. Regé-Jean Page, the debonair 34-year-old British star of Netflix’s “Bridgerton,” admits he’s “terribly flattered” to be favored by many to soon follow in Daniel Craig’s footsteps. “It’s a conversation people are having,” he said. There was one conversation Florence Pugh, 27, was determined not to have: one about the very public drama between herself, Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles during the movie “Don’t Worry Darling.” “I don’t really feel the need to go into the nitty-gritty details of ‘Don’t Worry Darling,’” the Brit said of the flick directed by Wilde and co-starring Wilde’s now-ex Styles. “So if it’s okay, I’ll probably just let that one sit.” An actor audiences will soon be seeing a ton of is Jonathan Majors. Still, the 33-year-old “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” star, who plays Kang the Conqueror in the film (which hits theaters Friday), said despite his newfound fame (he also bouts in the upcoming “Creed III”), he remains “a private individual.” “I have no interest in the f – – kery of the industry,” he said. “I’m in bed by 12 o’clock.” Also gracing the glossy’s cover are Austin Butler (“Elvis”), Emma Corrin (“The Crown”), Julia Garner (“Inventing Anna”), Selena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”), Keke Palmer (“Nope”), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (“Bullet Train”) and Jeremy Allen White (“The Bear”).
