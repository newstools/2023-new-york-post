Sunday’s Post exclusive revealing that nearly half of all city public high school graduates need remedial classes when they enroll at CUNY community colleges is fresh evidence that the city Department of Education isn’t getting the job done. Public-school grads are forced into remedial classes to survive their first semester thanks to years of lowered standards, grade inflation, grade-fixing, fraudulent credit-bearing make-up classes and outright cheating on exit exams. It got worse during the pandemic, as remote learning, chronic absenteeism and the suspension of normal graduation standards handed diplomas to countless ill-prepared students. Shamelessly, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and his schools chancellors crowed about rising graduation rates. But the damage started when Blas took office. In 2017, StudentsFirstNY released a study showing that more than 21,000 unprepared public-school grads spent an average of $3,000 a year on remedial classes — a “tax” of roughly $63 million a year to learn material they should have learned in high school. It’s obvious that a city diploma doesn’t signify being ready for college or a career. Meanwhile, state lawmakers block expansion of the public charter schools that actually do teach — even as they rush to send billions more to the system that keeps getting worse. Whatever happens in Albany, Mayor Eric Adams and Chancellor David Banks need to turn the Department of Education around. Start by axing every administrator involved in the lowering of standards. Nobody who rose in the de Blasio era should remain. The city’s young people and their families deserve better.
