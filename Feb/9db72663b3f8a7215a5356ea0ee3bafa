He burns sage on the court before the game in order to “cleanse the energy” within the building. May 30, 2021: After saying he hoped that “subtle racism” would not lead to Celtics fans disrespecting him in their playoff series, a fan throws a water bottle at Irving as he’s leaving the court at TD Garden (the fan was arrested).

Oct. 12, 2021: Nets GM Sean Marks announces Irving will be away from the team at the start of the season after he refused to get vaccinated against COVID-19, which would prevent him from playing in home games.
