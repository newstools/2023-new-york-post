Cops are looking for a person of interest in the killing of a man shot at a Harlem smoke shop. Police released two photos of a bearded man wanted for questioning in the Feb. 11 shooting-slaying of Alfred Johnson, 42. Johnson was fatally shot at Level Up Exotics – a Harlem smoke shop near the busy intersection at 125th Street and Fifth Avenue shortly after 10 p.m., police and sources said. The doomed man was struck in the chest and neck and pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital, police said. A trail of blood was splattered on the sidewalk outside of the Shake Shack across the street from the Level Up Exotics smoke shop. The NYPD did not give a motive for killing. A series of shootings at Big Apple smoke shops has cops beefing up resources to deal with what has become a “citywide problem,” The Post reported last week. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477. ) All calls are kept confidential.
