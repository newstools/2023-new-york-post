This wedding crasher surely lifted the bride’s spirits. Upon reviewing her wedding pictures, a newlywed and mother of four was shocked to see a faint image of what she believes is the spirit of her deceased daughter peeking out from behind a tree. “I don’t believe in many things,” penned Leah Murphy, 33, from Australia, in the closed captions of her touching TikTok testimonial. “But I believe she was there to watch myself and her dad get married in honor of her.” On Sept. 19, 2022, Murphy’s youngest daughter, Totty, died in a drowning accident at 17 months old. And in her viral post, which has amassed more than 1.3 million views, Murphy shared a haunting snapshot of her and groom Cecil locked in an impassioned kiss set against a backdrop of lush greenery during their outdoor nuptials in December 2022. In the background of the frame, a hazy figure, which mimics the shape of a small child, appears to be watching the smooch from a distance. “The recent loss of our daughter had me thinking that she wasn’t there, sharing our special day with us,” wrote Murphy, in part, in the caption of the clip, “[But] this proves otherwise.” And compassionate viewers agreed. “My jaw dropped then the tears came. That’s [definitely] her,” wrote a convinced commentator. “My tears instantly started falling once I seen her. She was making sure you would know she is always there with you,” said another. “She looks like she’s wearing a lovely light summery dress. She’s with you,” another encouraged. In closing, Murphy penned a heartfelt ode to her late little one in the caption of her video, saying, “I’m forever missing you, my little shadow.”
