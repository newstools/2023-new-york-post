Ready for some glam with the Gram? The biggest stars in music hit the red carpet for the 2023 Grammy Awards on Sunday from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. “Renaissance” curator Beyoncé led the nominations with nine nods — and she made history and beat the record for most Grammy wins of all time at 32. She almost missed her big moment, though, after getting stuck in traffic. Another early winner: actress Viola Davis, who nabbed the honor for Best Audio Book, Narration and Storytelling Recording for narrating her memoir, “Finding Me” — lifting her to coveted EGOT status. The 65th annual celebration, hosted by “The Daily Show” alum Trevor Noah, returned to an in-person format — it was live-streamed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic — and will be televised on CBS and streamed on Paramount+. Follow The Post’s live blog below, which will be updated throughout the night with all of the winners and the biggest highlights.
