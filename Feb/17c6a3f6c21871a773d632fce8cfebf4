That’s tough. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was booed mercilessly as he was honored at Super Bowl 2023 for being named the 2022 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. Prescott powered through the cold welcome with a smile as he was honored on the field at State Farm Arena in Glendale, Ariz. before the Chiefs and Eagles faced off in the big game. Although Fox Sports cameras didn’t show the booing fans, it’s safe to assume Philadelphia fans were enjoying the moment. After former Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth — the 2021 Walter Payton Man of the Year — introduced Prescott, he stepped forward and waved to the crowd. When the boos became louder, the quarterback began laughing before he shared a hug with Whitworth. Prescott was named the the 2022 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Thursday at the annual NFL Honors, which took place at Symphony Hall in Phoenix. “Thank you to the NFL, to Commissioner [Roger] Goodell, to Nationwide for recognizing the impact that we as NFL players can have off the field,” Prescott said at the time. “To the Payton family, I have such appreciation for Walter, for your beautiful family that continues the legacy through your charitable work.

Prescott’s season ended in a loss to the 49ers in the Divisional Round of the 2023 NFL Playoffs. A few days later, Page Six exclusively reported that the quarterback is casually dating LSU swimmer Jadyn Jannasch following his split from ex-girlfriend Natalie Buffett in March.
