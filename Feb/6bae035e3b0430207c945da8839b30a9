He was a real-life wolf in sheep’s clothing. José Luis Callisaya Diaz attempted to escape from Chonchocoro, a maximum security prison in Bolivia, earlier this month by wrapping himself in sheepskin and crawling through the grassland surrounding the jail. The inmate, also known as “El Araña,” used his fleece coat to sneak past security and attempted to break through one of the prison’s external walls on Feb. 4. Despite his sneaky attempts, security noticed Diaz, who is serving 15 years for homicide, was not in his cell. Photos of his bizarre attempted escape show the prisoner crawling around on all fours in a field while wearing the fuzzy coat before he was taken back into custody. Diaz thought the cold weather would provide some cover during his escape, prison officials said. “We inform the Bolivian population that prison security police officers from the San Pedro de Chonchocoro Penitentiary Center prevented the escape of prisoner José Luis Callisaya Diaz (alias El Araña), who took advantage of the inclement weather to try to flee through one of the walls of the external perimeter of the prison,” the Director of the Penitentiary Regime Juan Carlos Limpias said. Authorities have ordered legal and disciplinary actions against Diaz since his attempted escape. With Post wires.
