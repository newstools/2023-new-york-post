Here’s a chilling photo of rescuers valiantly carrying an injured 5-year-old Syrian girl through rubble to safety after she somehow survived a massive earthquake that’s left more than 24,500 dead in her country and nearby Turkey. The photo, posted by Reuters earlier Saturday, shows young Aisha apparently unconscious being moved in an orange gurney by about a half-dozen men. Onlookers atop higher ground watched in awe, many snapping photos of the heroes’ rescue effort with smartphones. Earlier Saturday, rescuers in Turkey pulled two women alive from the rubble of collapsed buildings after they were been trapped for 122 hours following the region’s deadliest quake in two decades. The death toll has reached at least 24,596 across southern Turkey and northwest Syria a day after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said authorities should have reacted faster to Monday’s huge 7.8 magnitude earthquake. In Turkey at least 21,043 have died while some 3,553 people have been reported dead in Syria, the AFP news agency  and Associated Press reported.
