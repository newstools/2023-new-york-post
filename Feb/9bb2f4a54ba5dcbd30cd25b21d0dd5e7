New footage caught a Tesla driver apparently snoozing while traveling on a busy California freeway — the second catnap captured this week of a motorist behind the wheel of one of the self-driving vehicles. The latest seemingly sleepy driver was seen Thursday, along northbound Interstate 5 near the Griffith Park section of Los Angeles, reported KTLA. A woman driving a red Tesla sedan in the “fast lane” is seen slumped to the side behind the wheel, apparently mid-nap. “She is dead asleep, bro! That is so funny,” fellow motorist Joshua Cadena, who recorded the clip, says to a friend. A few moments later, the female Tesla driver wakes up from her nap and lifts her head. “Well, she’s up now,” Cadena’s pal remarks, drawing peals of laughter. This latest incident comes a week after another Tesla owner was caught with their eyes wide shut while driving on Interstate 15 near Temecula, California. Viral video recorded by eyewitness Kiki Dolas shows a woman in a pink top and glasses with her head nodding off to the right as she sits behind the wheel of her white Tesla. “She is out, sleeping, completely knocked out,” Dolas says off camera, “and this car is driving her. Look at how dangerous that is, you guys. I’m sorry, that is too damn dangerous!” Dolas spent 15 minutes frantically honking her horn in a bid to wake the slumbering motorist before finally calling 911, she said. Tesla is already facing multiple investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stemming from crashes related to its controversial “full self-driving” and autopilot capabilities. Tesla’s website warns its electric cars can’t drive themselves. Last month, the Justice Department requested documents from Tesla related to its self-driving and autopilot features. The car company’s self-driving system is not “quite ready to have no one behind the wheel,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged in October.
