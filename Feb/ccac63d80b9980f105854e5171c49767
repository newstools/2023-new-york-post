Ben Affleck’s miserable puss — and wife J.Lo’s apparent frustration with her hubby’s behavior — gave us some of the most meme-able moments from Sunday night’s Grammy Awards. Now, a seat filler assigned to take up space near the newlyweds claims to have the inside scoop on what really happened. TikToker Almostanna breathlessly revealed to her followers — in a post that has already been watched 1.7 million times — that she observed Affleck, 50, at the very moment during the ceremony when he found out he’d become a meme. It didn’t play out the “tense” way it’s been reported, she said. “The whole time they were cute and s**t — J.Lo showed Ben Affleck the phone and was like, ‘Oh my God, honey, look at this meme circulating about you!’ And he was like, ‘Oh God, this again.’ Like he knew during the performance that he was a meme! Like he knew, and he also chose just not to change his expression! Like I love how unbothered that is,” she gushed. “So I know that she was like on her phone and saw it and was like, ‘Honey, this is so funny, look at this.’ And he was like, ‘Jesus Christ.’” The new claim that Lopez, 53, actually had a sense of humor about the moment contrasts with other accounts claiming that the singer was “controlling”, “reproachful” and “tense” during the evening. A lip reader even said that Lopez told her new husband to “stop,” to “look more friendly” and to appear “motivated.” But the TikToker’s account blows previous theories and reports out of the water. “They were super lovey dovey, like their hands were always intertwined,” she claimed. “I don’t know how to describe it. But they just were! So it wasn’t like, ‘Oh my God, this is going to lead to divorce!’ Like, they were cute!”
