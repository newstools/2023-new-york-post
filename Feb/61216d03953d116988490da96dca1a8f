Kate Upton certainly knows how to throw a party. Just ask her husband, Mets pitcher Justin Verlander, who praised Upton’s party planning skills on Monday after the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum 30, surprised him “with the best” 40th birthday bash. “The big 40!” Verlander exclaimed on Instagram. “Thank you to my wife, family & friends for surprising me with the best Verlander Vices birthday party!  I appreciate all the love!” Verlander, who celebrated the milestone birthday on Monday, Feb. 20, posted a video montage of the epic bash on his page, which featured the three-time Cy Young winner dancing on a stage with Upton. Elsewhere on social media, Upton — who has been married to Verlander since 2017 — gave her 6.5 million Instagram followers a peek at the intimate soiree, including the moment the guest of honor arrived for his big night. “Successfully pulled off the greatest surprise,” Upton captioned the video on her Instagram Story. In a separate post, Upton gushed over the birthday boy, writing in part, “I am so lucky to call you my husband.” “Nothing I love more than watching you live out your dream and be the amazing father that you are… I am so lucky to call you my husband. Wish we could relive this night forever!” she shared. In the final months of his 30s, Verlander — who shares 4-year-old daughter Genevieve with Upton — won his second World Series title with the Astros and then went on to sign a two-year, $86.6 million deal with the Mets in December 2022. Verlander recently reported to his first spring training with the Mets in Port St. Lucie, Fla. It remains to be seen if he or fellow ace, Max Scherzer, will get the Opening Day start on March 30 at Miami.
