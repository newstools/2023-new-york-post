An Arizona man allegedly beat a coworker to death with a baseball bat in the cafeteria of an Intel building, police said. Derrick Lemond Simmons, 50, was arrested after he attacked the unnamed coworker with a bat, knife and hatchet at the semiconductor manufacturer’s Ocotillo campus on Saturday, according to court documents obtained by Arizona Family. Chandler police responding to the scene found one person dead with fatal blunt force trauma injuries and another person injured. The second victim was reportedly injured after confronting Simmons. A spokeswoman for Chandler Police could not confirm the nature of the weapons used in the violent encounter. Simmons, 50, was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated assault and is being held on a $1 million cash bond. Simmons has a previous felony conviction, for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to FOX10 Phoenix. The victim’s name is being withheld until Chandler Police can notify immediate family members, a spokeswoman told Fox News. In 2021, Intel broke ground on a $20 billion project on the Ocotillo campus, creating two chip factories in Arizona. The Arizona project was hailed at the largest private-sector investment in the state’s history. Intel didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from Fox News Digital on Sunday.
