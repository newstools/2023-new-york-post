Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Saturday: Daniel Vogelbach went 2-for-3 with an RBI in the Mets’ 5-2 split-squad victory over the Marlins on Saturday in Port St. Lucie. Both of his hits were singles to right field that likely would have been grounded into the shift last year. Jose Butto struck out four straight batters but walked two and over 1 ²/₃ innings and was removed after 43 pitches. The right-hander allowed one earned run. T.J. McFarland threw a slider that broke Peyton Burdick’s bat on a grounder to third base in the fifth inning. The veteran left-hander McFarland, who pitched for Buck Showalter with the Orioles, is in camp on a minor league contract. Max Scherzer will start against the Nationals in Port St. Lucie.
