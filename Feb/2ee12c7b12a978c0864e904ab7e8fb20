A popular and longtime San Francisco radio DJ disappeared four days ago after writing an alarming Instagram post. Jeffrey Vandergrift — known as “JV” on the Bay Area’s Wild 94.9 hit music station — was last seen at his San Francisco home around 10 p.m. Thursday, according to a missing persons report that listed him as “at-risk.” Vandergrift’s employer said there has been no trackable activity on his phone or charges on his credit cards or bank accounts since he was reported missing to the San Francisco Police Department. “These updates are obviously incredibly worrisome, though we continue to hope and pray for better news,” the radio station wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. The 54-year-old morning show host notably edited the caption of the most recent post on his Instagram page — which was from Aug. 20 — around the time he disappeared. “Thank you for a wonderful life-filed w joy, laughs, pain & struggle. It’s been a great journey,” he wrote in the edited caption. “Your support & prayers meant the world.” He posted the same photo of himself in a red Wild 94.9 shirt to Twitter on Aug. 20 with the original caption “It’s #NationalRadioDay.I know, who gives a fart!!? Been at 94 since 94. Wow, that’s a long time Super grateful for each of you who have been on this journey w me.” Vandergrift is described as a 6-foot-tall, bald white man who weighs approximately 180 pounds. He has brown eyes and several tattoos on his arms and one above his right ear, police said. Wild 94.9 said it’s working closely with police and Vandergrift’s wife, Natasha Yi. “We are continuing to work closely with JV’s wife Natasha as well as the police department,” the station said. “JV is loved by everyone here at Wild 949 and iHeartMedia, and we know he is equally loved by his Bay Area listening family.” Listeners tuned in Monday morning to seek updates. “So incredibly difficult, it’s difficult for all of us, obviously,” his co-host Graham Herbert said on the air.
