One fan allegedly inappropriately acted on her “desire” for Oscar-nominated actor Paul Mescal. Paul Mescal was reportedly groped by a fan outside the Almeida Theatre in London after his sold-out performance of Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire,” reports ES Magazine. The “Aftersun” actor was posing with a fan for a picture when he felt the woman’s hand on his behind. “As we posed for it, she put her hand on my ass,” said the 27-year-old actor, who initially thought the placement of the hand was a mistake. According to Mescal, he attempted to move “but the hand followed.” It was then the actor said he confronted the theatergoer. “I remember tensing up and feeling just, like, fury. I turned to her and said, ‘What’re you doing? Take your hand off my ass,'” raged Mescal. “The last thing I want to do is call somebody out in front of the theater — it’s uncomfortable for everyone involved — but it was really not okay. It was so gross, creepy.” Mescal, who is a relative newcomer to Hollywood, celebrated his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his film “Aftersun.” “97% it is really nice — then 3% is somebody, like, grabbing your ass,” said Mescal on his new-found fame. Outside of his work on the silver screen, Mescal made headlines after splitting from singer Phoebe Bridgers. Mescal broke his silence on the breakup to state that while the temptation to set the record straight is still there, the actor said he will be keeping things “private … moving forward.”
