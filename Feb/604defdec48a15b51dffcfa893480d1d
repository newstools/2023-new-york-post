Wine and Valentine’s Day. They go so well together they should be buying each other roses. It’s almost time to raise a glass to your special someone, but who says you have to stop celebrating your love after February 14th. Wine Insiders has a deal for a shipment of 15 bottles of wine, and we’ve got a voucher that brings the price down to $80. This mixed box of 15 red and white wines is a fun way to celebrate the season of love. Arrange a decadent dinner with treats that pair with rich reds and crisp whites. That’s what one reviewer did, and they were thrilled with the results: “We’ve opened 7 bottles from this collection and every single one of them have been excellent. I’m just learning how to correctly pair wine with food…and these wines have made it easy to pick a winner every time.” These aren’t just table wines, either. Wine Insiders won the wine of the year trophy at the 2021 Sommelier Challenge International Wine and Spirits Competition, and every wine has been approved by a panel of wine tasting experts. Only about five out of every hundred bottles get accepted to Wine Insiders. When you complete your purchase, you’ll get a voucher you can redeem on Wine Insider’s website. Once you use your voucher, your order will be processed and should be shipped soon after. Shipping and tax are not included in your initial purchase. Wine Insiders says to plan for three to five days for shipping. That gives you just enough time to plan a fancy dinner. Planning a romantic Valentine’s Day dinner? A collection of 15 mixed wines could set the mood. Get a one-time shipment of 15 bottles of wine from Wine Insiders for just $79.99. Sale ends February 6 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Prices subject to change.
