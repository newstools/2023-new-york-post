A pair of armed crooks stole two cars at gunpoint from a Manhattan garage early Thursday, cops said. The duo entered the garage on West 37th Street near 10th Avenue in Hudson Yards around 4 a.m. and flashed a gun, authorities said. They then took off in two cars â€“ a black Chevy with the Vermont plate W130049, and a 2022 gray Audi SUV with the plate number KZM9940, police said. No one was hurt. The two suspects, who wore all black, multicolored hats and facemasks, were still on the loose later in the morning.
