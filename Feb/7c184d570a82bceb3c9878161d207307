An angry Eagles fan got his wings clipped Sunday night after he allegedly broke into a Florida firehouse and ransacked the bunkrooms, stole a uniform hat, urinated on the carpet and threw a meat cleaver at the firefighters whoconfronted him. Edward Dalasandro, 25, of Philadelphia, barged into the Hutchinson Island Fire Station in Martin County, Florida, at about 10 p.m. and stole the hat, $126 in cash and some knives, according to a Facebook post from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. Then he allegedly urinated on the floor near a closet. When firefighters found him, they got a nasty surprise in the form of a flying cleaver the disgruntled fan allegedly hurled at them. Police said the firefighters were able to hold Dalasandro — who in his mugshot wore an Eagles shirt and a black eye — until authorities arrived. Dalasandro faces charges of armed burglary, aggravated assault on a firefighter and theft. He was brought to the Martin County Jail, where he was held on $120,000bond. “The eagle was officially grounded for the second time in one night,” the Sheriff’s Office’s social media post said. Dalasandro’s beloved team lost Super Bowl LVII that night to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38 – 35.
