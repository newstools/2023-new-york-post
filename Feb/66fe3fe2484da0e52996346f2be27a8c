Law enforcement is hoping this quest has a fairytale ending. Hatfield, Massachusetts., police are on the hunt for a 200-pound, lime-green Shrek statue that mysteriously disappeared from its swamp. Police posted an alert of a photo of the hand-crafted sculpture, which was reported missing on Monday. “This approximate 200lb cement SHREK SCULPTURE has gone MISSING from his home on MOUNTAIN RD. If you have any information of his current whereabouts please reach out to our department or return him in the condition you found him,” police wrote Tuesday. “The dragon sculpture he lives with is frustrated and lonely,” the post added. A spokesperson for the Hatfield Police Department told Boston.com that the sculpture was “kind of [an] iconic statue in the town.” “It’s not something that could be easily moved around,” the spokesperson said. “There are evident drag marks that he did not go willingly.” The owner told law enforcement that the statue is worth maybe $500, but to him, “it’s priceless.” Shrek, who is the titular character of the 2001 animated Dreamworks film that spoofed fairytales, is an ogre known for his neon-green skin color and grumpy personality. The cult classic movie has had a slew of sequels and spinoffs, and in recent years has magically transformed like a frog prince into a beloved online icon.
