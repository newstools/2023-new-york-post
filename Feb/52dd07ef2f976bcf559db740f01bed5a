Tom Brady leaned on a familiar shoulder as he contemplated his football future, according to a new report. The former Buccaneers and Patriots quarterback, who retired from the NFL last week after 23 prolific seasons, is said to have discussed the matter with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, with a source telling Us Weekly that she has been “a real rock.” The exes “talked this through before he came to the final decision,” the insider said of Brady, 45, and Bündchen, 42, who divorced last fall. “Tom and Gisele are on cordial terms,” the source noted. Brady confirmed earlier this month that he’s stepping away from the game, sharing an emotional video on Instagram exactly one year after he announced his first NFL retirement, which lasted 40 days. Before the 2022 regular season, Page Six exclusively reported how Brady and Bündchen had engaged in a series of arguments over his decision to unretire. Weeks later, the pair confirmed in October they had finalized their divorce after 13 years of marriage. Bündchen, who shares son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10, with Brady, congratulated her ex on his retirement, posting on Instagram last week: “Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life.” Brady spent the first 20 seasons of his career in New England, where he won six Super Bowls with the Patriots. He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and won what would be his last Super Bowl in 2021. Brady said Monday during an appearance on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” how he’s looking to catch up on “other parts” of his life following his retirement. Brady also confirmed he’s going to wait until 2024 before sliding into Fox Sports’ top NFL booth. The quarterback signed a 10-year, $375 million deal with the network last spring. Reps for Brady and Bündchen did not immediately return The Post’s request for comment.
