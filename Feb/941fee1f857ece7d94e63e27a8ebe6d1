A Brooklyn thief swiped a pricey package from a FedEx worker in broad daylight earlier this week, police said Wednesday. The unidentified suspect yanked the package – that had an iPhone 12 pro inside – from the deliveryman’s hand Monday around 1:30 p.m. in front of a Gravesend home on East 1st Street, police said. The pricey Apple product is worth about $1,000, cops said. While the suspect threatened to hurt the 53-year-old victim during the robbery, no injuries were reported, police said. The male suspect is about 20 years old with a thin build and roughly 5-foot-5, the NYPD said. Cops released photos showing the suspect, as well as surveillance footage of the suspect on the sidewalk appearing to interact with the victim who was on steps in front of a home. The thief was last seen wearing a light green hoodie with a dark jacket and light jeans. He also was sporting white sneakers and a black cap. Anyone with information on the case can call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
