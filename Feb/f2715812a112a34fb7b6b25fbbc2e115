An off-duty NYPD officer was seriously injured and her husband was killed when she crashed her SUV into a tree on the Palisades Interstate Parkway â€” with the impact splitting the vehicle in two, according to state police. The deadly collission took place around 3 a.m. Sunday when the northbound 2021 Hyundai SUV veered off the roadway near Exit 13 in Haverstraw, slamming into a tree, New York State Police said in a press release. Chilling photos from the crash site show the two mangled sections of the white SUV resting several feet apart, with the rear of the vehicle wrapped around a tree. A blue tarp was draped over the back of the Hyundai. The vehicle was operated at the time by an off-duty NYPD cop, who was taken to Nyack Hospital in critical condition. Her husband, 36-year-old Chevy Thomas, of Maybrook, a passenger in the vehicle, was pronounced dead at the scene. State police are leading the investigation into the deadly crash. There was no immediate word on whether excessive speed or impairment played a role in the accident.
