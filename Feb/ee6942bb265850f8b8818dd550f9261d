An armed robber snatched a man’s Rolex watch and fired off a gunshot during a stick-up near Rockefeller Plaza on Monday night, according to police. The male suspect first tried to grab a satchel from the victim, a jeweler from New Jersey, but was unable to jerk it free from the man, sources said. He then shot into the ground during the struggle outside 20 West 48th St. before taking off with the victim’s fancy accessory around 6:30 p.m., police said. The bullet didn’t hit anyone, the NYPD said. The suspect fled westbound on foot wearing a red jacket with a fur hood and blue jeans, authorities said. No arrests have been made.
