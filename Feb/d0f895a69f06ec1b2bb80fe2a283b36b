Looks like this infamous armorer wouldn’t cut it as a costume designer, either. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for the weapon fired by Alec Baldwin when he inadvertently gunned down cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of “Rust,” was spotted for the first time in a year outside a home in Arizona — wearing a T-shirt with a skeleton on it. The tasteless choice of apparel featured the symbol of death lounging in a hammock in the dessert, under the phrase “Made in the Shade.” Gutierrez-Reed, 25, paired it with jeans, a black shoulder bag, and black sunglasses as she returned from a shopping trip Friday, took out trash and grabbed mail outside her home in Bullhead City, Ariz., according to snaps exclusively obtained by The Post. Hutchins was fatally shot on the set of “Rust” at Bonanza Creek Ranch in Sante Fe in October 2021, after Baldwin’s prop gun fired a live round, hitting her in the chest. She was 42. Gutierrez-Reed and Baldwin were both charged with involuntary manslaughter and could each face a five-year prison sentence. Gutierrez-Reed, whose dad is prominent Hollywood armorer Thell Reed, turned tail and fled as she was asked about the case outside a local grocery store, according to video provided by the photo agency Backgrid. A man who was with her refused to answer questions, saying only that Gutierrez-Reed was “not doing good because of this s–t.” The armorer, who appears to have fresh tattoos on her right arm, now lives in a $114,000 two-bed, two-bath property with views of the Colorado River — not far from her well-known dad.
