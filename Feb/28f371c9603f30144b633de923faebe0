A woman has caught the attention of social media after sharing videos of her fridge online. Eve, who goes by @gardenof_eve on TikTok, recently took to the social media platform to share the inside of her fridge. Inside, she includes flowers such as hydrangeas, roses and baby’s breath, as well as a photo of her cat among her groceries. She even themed one version of her fridge for Valentine’s Day, including a large heart shaped box and red veggies such as tomatoes and capsicums. Eve’s fridge features veggies in clear tubular containers, neatly lined up drinks, her vitamins in tiny vials and her eggs placed in a beautiful presentation. But, the reaction from social media has been mixed with some praising the extravagant fridge layout. One person commented on the video series: “Decorating your fridge with FLOWERS. I’M ALL IN.” “The flowers and pictures in your fridge?!? Girl I can’t even get leftovers in mine lol,” another said on the clips. One added: “Now why do I want flowers in my fridge and a cat pic.” Another social media user added: “Why are so many of you such haters?? This is awesome! I wish I were that healthy and had a fridge this clean!” “The rich ppl are getting too rich, they’re starting to decorate their fridges to waste their money now,” another commented on the video. One added: “And I thought it was crazy enough that people take juice out of its container to place into another jar.” Eve defended her choice to beautify the inside of her fridge, saying she was single and without children and it brought her joy. Many social media users questioned whether the flowers went bad while inside of the fridge. ‘Also – florists put their flowers in the fridge, people just think it’s insane because not everyone does it,’ she explained about the floral arrangements.
