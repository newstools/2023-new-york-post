Facetune has a nice ring to it. One woman on TikTok revealed that she just wanted to share the happy news of her engagement with her coworkers, but it ended up taking an embarrassing turn. Tali, who goes by the username @tawlss on the social media app, shared more about the mortifying moment in a video that has now reached over 4.5 million views. In the 4-second clip, Tali showed the photo of her and her fiancé celebrating their engagement on a boat. She had sent the photo to her work’s Slack channel, only to realize that the file name still read, “Facetune.” “My teeth are yellow ok,” she wrote in the caption of the post. The Post has reached out to Tali for comment. Facetune is a photo editing application that people can use to fix their appearances in a photo–for example, you can make your teeth look whiter, as Tali did, make your skin appear smoother, and even change the color of your hair. In the comments section of the video, users went wild over her mistake, with some admitting that they’ve done the exact same thing before. “Girl, no judgements we’ve all done it before,” one user typed. Another agreed, writing, “Omfg I’ve had this happen before. Why does facetune need to rename the image like that and expose us .” “This happened at my work but it was a pic of her newborn baby ,” one person shared. “I’ve done this too for my corporate headshot ,” someone else seconded. The viral video even promoted Facetune’s official TikTok account to leave her a comment congratulating her on the proposal. “Congrats on the engagement ,” they commented. However, this is not the first time someone has had to work around an engagement fail — last November, TikToker Sadie Elizabeth went viral after her engagement ring didn’t fit, so her best friend had to wear it on her finger for photos. “When your ring doesn’t fit but your bestie comes in clutch,” the text on the video read.
