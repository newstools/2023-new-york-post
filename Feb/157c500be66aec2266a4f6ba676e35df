Attention spans are getting shorter than ever, but as a favor to us, we’re going to ask you to think back all the way to December of last year. Before the Valentine’s Day rush, before the NFL Playoffs, before New Year’s Eve parties and even Christmas, back to the season finale of “White Lotus” Season 2. Hold it in your mind, just for a second. You’ve probably moved on, TV-wise. Maybe you’re into “The Last of Us,” or maybe you’re stuck on J-Lo’s “Shotgun Wedding.” But a few short months ago, Sicily was all the rage. And if we know anything about Sicily, it’ll be back in fashion, sooner or later. It’s well known that Italians do it better, so why wouldn’t their espresso be top notch? If you don’t already own a Nespresso machine, as they say in Italy: there’s no better time than the present. For a limited time, Amazon is offering 25% off both the Nespresso Vertuo Next Coffee and Espresso Machine, and a model with an added milk frother.
