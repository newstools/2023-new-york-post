After making predications on where his former teammate would play next season, Rob Gronkowski wished Tom Brady well following the legendary QB’s retirement announcement on Wednesday morning. He couldn’t help having at little fun with it, however. Speaking from experience, the former NFL tight end took to Twitter to welcome the seven-time Super Bowl Champion to the “2x retired club.” He added, “You’re a legend and you always will be, my friend.” Gronkowski, 33, played with Brady and the Patriots for eight years. He retired in 2019 with a myriad of awards including three Super Bowl rings, four All-Pro selections and five Pro Bowls made, only to come out of retirement to play with Brady again in Tampa Bay in 2020 and 2021. The pair added another Super Bowl win with the Buccaneers, beating the Kansas City Chiefs in 2021. In gaining another ring and putting together a successful 2021 campaign with the Bucs, Brady seemed ready to retire. Yet, the feeling only lasted 40 days until the eve of NFL free agency and he made the decision to play another season in Tampa. Gronkowski did not do the same. A year later, Brady has called it quits “for good” this time, leaving on his only losing season (8-9) after losing in the wild-card round of the playoffs to the Cowboys. Brady ends his career with seven Super Bowls wins, five Super Bowl MVPs, 15 Pro Bowl appearances, and as the NFL’s all-time leader in regular-season completions (7,753), passing yards (89,214) and touchdowns (649), to go with a record 251 victories. At the end of his emotional announcement video, Brady said, “I wouldn’t change a thing. I love you all.” In the next chapter, Brady will take on the sports television industry as an NFL analyst with a 10-year $375 million contract with Fox Sports.
