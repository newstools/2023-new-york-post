TAMPA — The Yankees rolled out a new $360 million first baseman on Tuesday — if only for a day on a back field. Aaron Judge did his best Anthony Rizzo impression during a workout at the Yankees’ player development complex, stepping in at first base to field throws from second baseman DJ LeMahieu and shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and even taking some grounders himself after the group took batting practice. The 6-foot-7 Judge, wearing a first baseman’s mitt, provided a big target for LeMahieu and Kiner-Falefa as they got in their work ahead of the Yankees’ first full-squad workout next Monday. Yankees’ pitchers and catchers are set to report on Wednesday with their first workout on Thursday. Judge is coming off his historic 2022 season in which he broke the franchise and American League record by hitting 62 home runs en route to winning the AL MVP. He slashed .311/.425/.686 with 131 RBIs, 111 walks, 133 runs and 16 steals. The 30-year-old flirted with other teams in free agency but re-signed on a nine-year contract with the Yankees, who then named Judge the 16th captain in franchise history.
