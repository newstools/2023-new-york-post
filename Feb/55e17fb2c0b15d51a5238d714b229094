John Cena has a brand new look that has fans raising their eyebrows. The former WWE star, 45, was spotted in Melbourne, Australia, recently filming his upcoming flick “Ricky Stanicky” — and rocking some traditionally feminine-looking garments. Cena sported a black T-shirt; a short, black-and-white plaid skirt; thigh-high stockings and lace-up black leather heels. “Ricky Stanicky” is a comedy, directed by Peter Farrelly, that follows three friends who play a prank by burning down a house. The teens then create a fake character on whom to blame for their actions. Over the next two decades, the trio used the lie to get out of sticky situations — until one day they have to hire an actor to portray Stanicky. Zac Efron and William H. Macy help round out the cast. A release date has yet to be set. Cena tweeted his enthusiasm about the flick on Feb. 1. “Beyond excited to help bring these characters to life (both on- and off-screen) with an incredible cast, our director and producers and partners at @AmazonStudios @primevideo,” the “Peacemaker” star wrote. “#RickyStanicky is a best friend to all — can’t wait for you to meet him!” he gushed. “The Suicide Squad” actor opened up to British GQ last year about switching up careers from wrestling to acting. “The term Hollywood has such a mystique and luster around it. If you’re skilled at doing one thing, and then you transition into doing another — really, it sounds the same, but it’s a completely different thing,” he said. “If you have any chance of success, you have to really, really prepare as much as you can.” For the Massachusetts native, his drive comes from “just trying to work as hard as I can to catch up to everybody else,” he said. “If you feel you don’t have a head start, you’ve just got to put rubber to the road and work your ass off,” Cena added. “So that’s kind of where I’m at, dipping my toes back into the screen side of entertainment rather than live events.”
