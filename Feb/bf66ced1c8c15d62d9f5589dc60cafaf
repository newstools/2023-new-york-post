A man was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a luxury condo building in Midtown — and his wife told cops he was stressed about a “work incident,” police and sources said. Steven Lord, 58, was found “unconscious and unresponsive” at 310 E. 53rd St. at 11:07 a.m. Sunday, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. “The wife was on scene and told us he had expressed stress over some sort of a work incident,” a police source said. Investigators do not suspect any criminality, cops said. The Office of the City Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death. The 29-floor glass tower is located in Manhattan’s tiny Turtle Bay neighborhood and has 88 units with hardwood floors, high ceilings and oversize windows, according to the property’s website. Two-bedroom units start at around $2 million and run as high as $2.8 million, listings on StreetEasy.com show. In May 2022, a French financier jumped to his death from a luxury high-rise while taking a tour of a unit with a real estate agent in the same neighborhood, police sources said at the time. Charles-Henry Kurzen, 43, plummeted from a 32th-floor balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza and landed on a third-floor patio, police aid.
