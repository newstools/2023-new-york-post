Pancreatic cancer is rising in the US, but rates are rising faster in young women — particularly black women. A report published in the peer-reviewed journal Gastroenterology found that rates of pancreatic cancer in women age 55 and younger have risen by 2.4% in comparison to men the same age, with scientists calling for more research into the alarming trend. “There’s a need to understand these trends, and to make changes today so this doesn’t affect women disproportionately in the future,” senior author of the study Dr. Srinivas Gaddam said in the press release. The figures were even more concerning for black women, with the rates 2.23% higher than in young black men. “While we’re reporting improving survival in pancreatic cancer each year, that improvement is largely among men,” Gaddam said. “The mortality rate among women is not improving.” Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers in the US and accounts for 3% of all cancer deaths in the country. It’s more common among men than women. Researchers used data from the National Program of Cancer Registries database, which represents approximately 64.5% of the US population, examining the data from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2001 and 2018. Gaddam added the data showed a small increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer and will hopefully encourage people to make healthier choices to reduce the risk of cancer. “Awareness might refocus people on the need to stop smoking, reduce alcohol use, eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly and manage their weight,” he said. “These lifestyle changes all help decrease the risk of pancreatic cancer.”
