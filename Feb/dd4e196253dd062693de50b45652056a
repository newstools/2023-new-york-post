Super Bowl Sunday got off to a memorable start for Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti. The 26-year-old Allegretti and his wife, Christina, welcomed twin girls ahead of Super Bowl 2023, according to The Associated Press, which reported that Christina gave birth at home in Chicago early Sunday morning. Allegretti, a 2019 seventh-round pick out of Illinois, is said to have kept tabs on the events via FaceTime from the lobby of the Chiefs’ hotel. Christina, who wed Allegretti in June 2021, was in attendance for Kansas City’s AFC Championship win over the Cincinnati Bengals last month at Arrowhead Stadium. “Super Bowl Bound!” she exclaimed on Instagram at the time. Christina was in attendance for Allegretti’s first Super Bowl win in February 2020, when the Chiefs defeated the 49ers at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. “Permanent smiles,” she posted on social media following Kansas City’s 31-20 victory. In addition to Allegretti, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman is also on baby watch, tweeting Sunday morning that girlfriend Chariah Gordon‘s “water broke.” Gordon later took to her Instagram Stories, where she appeared to post from the back of an ambulance. “Thanks for jinxing me everyone,” she captioned the video. On the opposite side of the field, Eagles center Jason Kelce and his wife, Kylie, are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their third child. In fact, Kylie is planning to bring her ob-gyn to the Super Bowl, Kelce recently revealed on an episode of his “New Heights” podcast with his brother, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. “That could be a super Kelce Bowl,” Kelce said at the time. “If she has a baby in the stadium, it’s officially scripted.” Elsewhere, the wife of Kelce’s teammate, Eagles wide receiver and return specialist Britain Covey, is also expecting. The Coveys are due in March. The Chiefs and Eagles kick off from Glendale, Arizona, in Super Bowl 2023 at 6:30 p.m. ET.
