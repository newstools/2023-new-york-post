Claw and order. Multiple people were rushed to a hospital in India on Wednesday after a bloodthirsty leopard went on the attack inside a courthouse. Eyewitnesses at the Ghaziabad District Court in Uttar Pradesh State say the spotted predator appeared “out of nowhere” before it began mauling those inside the building. Several lawyers, a police officer and a boot polisher were clawed by the creature, according to Jam Press. “The leopard was first seen under the stairs in the court building,” one witness told local media. “On seeing the people, the leopard ran from there. It pounced on the people and started running.” The boot polisher was reported to have sustained the most severe injuries, with his condition described as “serious.” The wild cat also mauled at least four lawyers, with one ravaged by the beast while trying to fend it off with a shovel and a stick. The shocking incident was caught on camera, with the frightening footage showing the leopard with blood around its mouth as it snarls. Ambulance crews quickly arrived on the scene, as did a 12-person team from the local forest department who were tasked with capturing the creature. The leopard was eventually detained, according to The Independent. The publication reports that the animal sustained several injuries “which the forest department veterinarians are treating with antibiotics and multivitamins.” According to officials, the leopard will be released away from human settlements once it fully recovers. Wednesday’s incident is not the first shocking leopard attack to be caught on camera in India. Last December, a wild leopard went on an unprovoked rampage through the northeastern town of Jorhat, injuring 15 people. Several required medical treatment after being bitten or clawed by the animal, which subsequently ran off into the wild.
