A gunman armed with a handgun and a machine gun ambushed a Queens bodega worker on Wednesday in a horrifying caught-on-camera shooting. Surveillance footage obtained by The Post shows the 47-year-old employee at Rockaway Express Deli in South Ozone Park assisting a customer from behind the counter when the suspect runs in around 2:30 p.m. and shoots him with a handgun at point-blank range. The gunman, dressed in all black with a face mask and beanie, aims for the employee’s face and fires at least three shots as the man grabs his head and falls to the ground behind the counter, yelling, according to the video. The suspect exits the store as the victim bleeds from his head, but returns seconds later with a massive machine gun, the footage shows. The shooter tilts the machine gun over the counter at the employee still crouched in the corner and fires at him several more times before leaving the store. Police said the 47-year-old employee was shot in the eye and a second, 27-year-old man suffered a wrist injury — possibly from a bullet fragment or shell casing. Both victims were treated at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. Police identified the alleged shooter as 35-year-old Donnie Hudson who lives in an apartment about the Rockaway Boulevard deli. Hudson reportedly got into a dispute with the store workers before he came back with a gun. Officers arrested him later that evening and charged him with attempted murder, criminal possession of a machine gun, criminal possession of loaded firearm, criminal possession of ammo clip, criminal possession of large capacity ammo-feeding device and unlawful possession of ammo-feeding device, police said.
