LeBron James is quickly approaching NBA history and it will cost fans a pretty penny to catch it. In Thursday night’s comeback win against the Pacers, James scored 26 points, putting him 63 points away from dethroning Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the league’s all-time leading scorer. James averages 30.1 points and faces the Pelicans in New Orleans on Saturday and then heads home Tuesday to play the Thunder. Barring load management or any injuries, this puts him on pace to have a legitimate shot at breaking the record against the Thunder. Fans who are looking to see this legendary achievement in person are going to be taking a chunk out of their wallet. While Vivid Seats has numerous seats listed in the $300 range, getting courtside seats for the action will set folks back as much as $200,000. There are much more reasonable $92,000 options available, too. Two corner seats on the court are going for $200,000 — and that’s not including the service fee of nearly $50,000. Other courtside seats are close to $100,000, and could increase depending on his performance against the Pelicans. According to ESPN’s record-breaking tracker, the projected date for him to pass Abdul-Jabbar is Feb. 9 when the Lakers host the Bucks. Lakers-Thunder ticket buyers better hope James has a good showing against the Pelicans because there’s no refunds or exchanges once tickets are purchased.
