Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany Matthews might be nursing a hangover after the Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade festivities on Wednesday. The proud wife took her 1 million-plus Instagram followers along for the ride, sharing videos of boozy celebrations on the parade route, all the way to the after-party at Mosaic nightclub in downtown Kansas City. Mahomes, the two-time Super Bowl MVP, was crushing Coors Lights while Brittany ripped shots with Chiefs WAGs and other gal pals. Earlier in the day, Paige Buechele, the wife of backup quarterback Shane Buechele, told Brittany: “Let’s take another shot.” The KC Current co-owner was fired up, and yelled, “Hey, I like that Paige!” The pair paled around on the roof of one of the red buses that drove the team and their loved ones through the streets of Kansas City, where fans lined the parade route and were cheering from building balconies. After a rally at Union Station, where Mahomes got the crowd riled up on the mic, everyone headed to Mosaic for the private after-party. The Chiefs enjoyed VIP bottle service inside the club, which displayed their Kansas City logo on screens throughout the venue. The team’s red and gold colors flashed from the overhead lights as club stuff held a lit-up sign that read: “MVP PAT X KILLA TRAV.” Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce was not seen in Brittany’s videos, although it is believed he was present at the after-party. The Chiefs defeated the Eagles, 38-35, at State Farm Stadium in Super Bowl 2023 on Sunday, winning their third world championship in franchise history. The 27-year-old Mahomes is now a two-time Super Bowl winner and MVP of the big game. The quarterback also won his second NFL MVP this season.
