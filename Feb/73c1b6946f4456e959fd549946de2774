These little horses kicked off the Big Game. In honor of the Super Bowl, Illinois nonprofit Mane in Heaven hosted its own Mini Bowl last week, in which its miniature therapy horses played football. The all-volunteer organization, which provides animal-assisted therapy, posted a YouTube video of the sporty creatures pushing an inflatable football. The competition took place in their barn in Barrington Hills, while volunteers cheered them on from the sidelines. Fans were able to virtually view the event, a spin on the Puppy Bowl, and even vote for its MVP. Mane in Heaven’s animals visits hospitals, nursing and retirement homes, veteran facilities, and schools. “When our horses are not doing therapy work they love to play and have fun,” said Mane in Heaven’s president, Dina Morgan. “How can you not smile watching these adorable minis play?” This is the event’s second year. The group hopes to make it an annual tradition.
