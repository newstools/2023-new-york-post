You’re not welcome here! A UK-based delivery driver claims she was banned from a McDonald’s location after a TikTok video she posted went viral. The TikToker, under the moniker of @atlantadelivers, posted a clip of her alleged 25-minute wait before she gave up and walked out of the store, criticizing the worker’s speed The clip has been viewed 2.7 million times. “‘I’ve just been banned from my McDonalds,” Atlanta said. “I walked in…[an employee] looked at me for a second, then she was like, ‘we can’t serve you. You’re not allowed in here.’” Initial footage showed Atlanta seemingly joining a horde of people waiting for their order before she abruptly walked out of the store. “I give up with that order, there getting nun (nothing) ready, there’s no one doing deliveries, it’s now 2:59 p.m., so I’ve been there for 25 minutes. Absolutely nothing,” she said in the video that now has around 2.7 million views on TikTok. After she storms out the door, she canceled the McDonald’s delivery trip and proceeded to make her next delivery stop at Starbucks. When she returns for another order at the same spot, she encountered a frustrated employee who delivered the message. “We’re not allowed to give you orders anymore,” the worker said. The deliverer, unfazed by the rejection, walked out of McDonald’s. Commenters on TikTok stormed the comment section of the videos, in which some even recognized the McDonald’s location in West Sussex and shared their McDonald’s delivery experiences. “As a driver myself, I know as soon as I get a McDonald’s order I’m gonna be waiting. The McDonald’s delivery system SERIOUSLY needs revising,” a user named Princess Alice Manor commented. “McDonald’s delivery was the worst thing to ever happen… just an absolute nightmare for everyone involved,” a user replied under the video.
