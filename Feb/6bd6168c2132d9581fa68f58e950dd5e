Davis Webb has landed his first NFL coaching job. And his first task will be helping Russell Wilson overcome a career-worst season. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Thursday that Webb has been hired as the quarterbacks coach for Sean Payton’s staff with the Broncos. Webb, just 28 years old, started the final game of the Giants’ 2022 regular season — his only NFL start — and was the team’s third-round pick in 2017. He also spent time with the Jets and Bills before returning the Giants, after head coach Brian Daboll was hired away from Buffalo, in February 2022. Schefter previously reported that Webb wanted to get into coaching after this season, noting in January that the Bills had offered him their quarterbacks coach job last year — vacant after promoting Ken Dorsey to offensive coordinator when Daboll left for the Giants. Instead, Webb became the Giants’ No. 3 quarterback behind Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor, and he earned his first, and only, start in the season-finale against the Eagles after a late pivot. Webb finished 23-for-40 with 178 yards and one touchdown, while adding a rushing touchdown, and kept the Giants within one possession at the end of the game. His first coaching stop will come on Payton’s new staff in Denver. The former Saints head coach was hired when the Broncos finalized a package of picks to send to New Orleans, and the 59-year-old will face the challenge of reversing Wilson’s concerning trend last season — when he threw a career-worst 16 touchdowns along with 11 interceptions, leading to a 5-12 record that forced the team to fire first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett during the season. At the same time, Webb was a part of the Giants’ restart that featured a 9-7-1 record and their first postseason berth since 2016. And now, Webb will become a part of Denver’s restart, too. This time, he’ll be in a coaching role.
