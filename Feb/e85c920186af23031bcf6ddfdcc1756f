Here are some nuggets from Metsâ€™ spring training on Friday: Brett Baty had hits in his two at-bats of an intrasquad scrimmage Friday at Clover Park, singling over shortstop leading off and doubling into the left-center gap. The Mets had seven of nine players who could be in the Opening Day lineup stacked on one side of the intrasquad. Brandon Nimmo and Starling Marte were both on the bench. Eduardo Escobar lunged to his right for a diving grab at third base on a line drive in the second inning. The Mets begin the Grapefruit League with split-squads, facing the Astros (in West Palm Beach) and Marlins (in Port St. Lucie).
