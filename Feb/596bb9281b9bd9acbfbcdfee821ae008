A 29-year old man was shot to death in the lobby of his Bronx building — and a man and woman were both wounded by gunfire on a Queens street in two separate bursts of violence on Saturday night and early Sunday, cops said. Two men were also stabbed in a separate incident in Brooklyn and one of them was struggling to survive, police said. The victim who died was shot in the chest and head during a dispute in the lobby of a building on Sheridan Avenue near Grand Concourse around 11 p.m., according to police. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital but couldn’t be saved. His name was not released, pending family notification. The shooter fled in a dark sedan, cops said. The motive wasn’t immediately known. The bullets flew on Beach 100th Street in Rockaway Beach around 4 a.m. leaving the 22-year-old woman shot in the right foot and the 35-year-old man shot in the left leg. The gunfire followed a fight inside a residence that spilled out into the street, according to police. It was unclear what the fight was about. They were both rushed to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition. Four shell casings were found on the scene. Two men were stabbed in a separate fight at Parade Place and Canton Avenue in Brooklyn around 12:30 a.m. A man in his 30s was in critical condition after he was knifed in the torso, cops said. He was taken to Maimonides Hospital. A 35-year-old man was also stabbed in the torso but he was in stable condition at Kings County Hospital. The suspect was described as a man wearing a white and black jacket and a white face mask. He fled on foot.
