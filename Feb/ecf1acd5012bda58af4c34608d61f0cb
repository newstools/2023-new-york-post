Don’t let Rip know you’re staying at the Dutton Ranch, but if you’d like to tempt the foreman, now you can. The ranch featured on the third season of the popular television series is now listed for rent on Vrbo, allowing you to live out your wild western fantasies in real life, as opposed to watching them unfold on Paramount+ or Peacock. Located in Oakley, Utah, the Twilight Moon Ranch is available to rent, going for $2,895 per night, on average, with a four night minimum stay. The property is sprawling, so if the price seems steep, round up a gang of fellow cowboys to split your stay, as the home sleeps 22 people, with 17 beds and 7 full baths. This is just the Ranch House, so should your honky tonk involve more people, you can also inquire about renting the adjoining Barn House that will bring the total number of guests up to 32. The 8,500 square-foot property is more than just beds and baths. Guests can enjoy an outdoor fire pit, a game room with foosball, air hockey and video game consoles, a hot tub that fits 12 and sprawling land for games and outdoor activities. Not only is the house perfect for fans of the hit show, but also for other luxury travelers, as the property and the host have rave reviews. “This property is breathtaking, and photos truly don’t do it justice,” reads one review from November. “The home is very well appointed with all the things you need for your stay. Jenny, the host, is also wonderful — she’s extremely communicative and willing to go the extra mile to help and make sure you have the best experience.” Want to book your stay before all dates are booked up?
