A 17-year-old boy was busted for subway surfing in Queens on Wednesday — just two days after another teenager was killed pulling the same stunt on the Williamsburg Bridge. The teen, whose name is being withheld because of his age, was charged with reckless endangerment shortly after 10:15 p.m. at Queensboro Plaza after passengers on the northbound No. 7 train notified authorities, police said. Police said he was riding atop the last car of the train. He does not have any prior arrests, law enforcement sources said. The arrest is the latest example of the dangerous trend that has left daredevil Big Apple teens dead or injured — including 15-year-old Zackery Nazario, who was fatally injured as he rode atop a northbound J train on Monday. Sources said Nazario’s girlfriend began to climb on top of the train behind him as it sped over the bridge, and, when he turned back to look at her, his head struck a metal beam. He was thrown from the train and fell under it, cops said. “The family is hurt,” his devastated mom, Norma Nazario, said outside her Alphabet City apartment Tuesday, describing her son as a “very, very nice kid.” One mom whose son was seriously injured in January — also while riding a train over the Williamsburg Bridge — urged city teens to stop the risky stunt. “I am lucky, although I don’t know if my son will ever get completely better,” the mom, who asked not to be identified, told The Post on Wednesday. “When it happened [to Nazario] the other day, I had survivor’s guilt,” she said. “I wish there was something I could have done to prevent another mother and family from going through what I’m going through.” She added: “One of the first steps we should take is to stop giving it this cool name. “This is nothing like riding a wave in the ocean,” she said. “There is nothing cool about getting your brains knocked out.”
