Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has reportedly been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The subpoena was issued to Meadows by special counsel Jack Smith’s office in January, according to multiple outlets, and seeks documents and testimony related to the Capitol riot. Last week, it was reported that former Vice President Mike Pence had been issued a subpoena by Smith’s team in relation to the same investigation into the 76-year-old former president. The demand for Meadows’ testimony and records predates the subpoena issued to Pence, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meadows resisted efforts to compel him to testify in a special grand jury investigation in Georgia probing Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden in the Peach State. The former White House chief of staff cited executive privilege in an unsuccessful attempt to block him from having to appear before the grand jury. Pence, who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is also expected to resist his subpoena by arguing that during his time as vice president he was covered by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate clause as president of the Senate, according to reports. The clause protects members of Congress from being questioned in court about legislative acts. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) unsuccessfully used that tactic in Georgia in an attempt to dodge a subpoena. Smith, a veteran prosecutor, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November to oversee multiple investigations into Trump, one related to Jan. 6 and one into his mishandling of classified material.
