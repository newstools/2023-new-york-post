Trevor Noah took his role as host of the 2023 Grammy Awards as an opportunity to poke some jaw-dropping fun at Prince Harry. Noah, 38, referenced a revealing part of the Duke of Sussex’s memoir “Spare” while introducing James Corden, 44, as a presenter. “James Corden is a 12-time Emmy winner and host of ‘The Late Late Show,’ ” the comedian said, while sitting next to Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck — who looked “miserable” during the ceremony. “He’s also living proof that a man can move from London to LA and not tell everyone about his frostbitten penis,” the comedian continued. Harry, 38, wrote in his book that he suffered a frostbitten “todger” during a 2011 North Pole trip. “Upon arriving home I’d been horrified to discover that my nether regions were frost nipped,” the royal wrote. He also recalled applying Elizabeth Arden cream to soothe the freezer-burned phallus that was “oscillating between extremely sensitive and borderline traumatized.” After a friend recommended the ointment as a home remedy, the royal remembered that Princess Diana had used the same cream for her lips. “I found the tube and the minute that I opened it, the smell transported me through time,” he says in the book. “It felt as if my mother was right there in the room, and I took a smidge and applied it down there.” While Harry was not in attendance at the Grammys, it is possible he could be there as a nominee next year if his audiobook gets nominated for the Best Audio Book, Narration and Storytelling Recording category.
