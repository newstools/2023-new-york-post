The sports comedy “80 for Brady” scored a touchdown at the box office Friday, with $5.45 million in sales on its opening night, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. The flick, which The Post called “a fumble” follows four friends — played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sally Field and Rita Moreno — who travel to the 2017 Super Bowl to witness their hero Tom Brady play football. Landing in second was the thriller “Knock at the Cabin,” with a $5.4 million take. The Post called the film “[director] M. Night Shyamalan’s latest sledgehammer.” “Avatar: The Way of Water” which held the top spot last Friday, seven weeks after its release, plunged to third place with $2.35 million in sales. The theatrical release of the crowdfunded series about Jesus Christ, “The Chosen” Season 3: Episode 1 & 2, came in fourth, taking home $2.27 million. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which was in second place last Friday, crawled its way down to fifth, earning $1.69 million.
