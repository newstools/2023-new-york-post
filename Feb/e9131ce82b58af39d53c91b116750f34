The phrase “a rolling stone gathers no moss” is well known, but what about its kitchen-themed counterpart, “a dull knife dices no onions”? You don’t hear the latter phrase quite so often, despite the fact that we see a lot more knives in our day-to-day lives than we do stones, especially rolling ones. Typically, you’ll want to stay clear of those, to avoid head injuries, and the like. But chefs at every level, from Michelin-Star-rated artisans to Kraft mac n’ cheese-caliber-cooks know that there’s nothing more frustrating in the kitchen than a dull knife. It’ll stop your recipe in its tracks. Exactly what you don’t want if you’re planning on cooking an elaborate Valentine’s Day dinner for your partner. Luckily, as almost always, Amazon has a solution.
