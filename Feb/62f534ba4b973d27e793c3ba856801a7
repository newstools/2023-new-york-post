Reese Witherspoon will not bend (or snap) this rule. Witherspoon revealed Thursday that the third installment of “Legally Blonde” will not happen without Jennifer Coolidge, reports Entertainment Tonight. “There is no ‘Legally Blonde 3’ without Jennifer Coolidge,” said the “Big Little Lies” actress before saying she was “beyond myself” with pride for her co-star. “She deserves every one of those flowers she is receiving right now,” continued the 46-year-old. “And she’s just one of those people who is so naturally gifted and funny, and that you can just tell people love her ’cause she gets up there and everybody’s like, ‘I love her.'” “But she’s just done a lot of good work in our business for so long that it’s really nice to see her getting this incredible moment.” In October of 2022, Coolidge revealed that she was still waiting to hear from the film’s writers Mindy Kaling and Dan Goor about her return as Paulette Bonafonté — Elle Wood’s manicurist and friend  — in the series’ third movie. “I know nothing. I mean, I don’t know if they wanted to surprise me or something, ’cause I hear about it a lot,” Coolidge said to Entertainment Tonight. “I heard that Mindy has this amazing version of our next round, but I haven’t seen it. I don’t have the call yet.” Kaling recently said that Coolidge would “1,000 percent” be in the film — which has been in production since 2018 and has been delayed several times due to COVID-19 and several rewrites to the script. “We’re not afraid of the character in this world, and we don’t feel we have to apologize for her,” Kaling said. “As a fan, I didn’t want to watch her be canceled or become a Karen. That’s what’s been interesting and challenging — and why it’s taking us such a long time to write.” As of Sunday, there is no official date for everyone’s favorite Gemini vegetarian and her best friend who just wants to eat a hot dog really bad to return to the big screen.
