Olivia Dunne tells it like it is. The LSU gymnast and social media influencer recently shut down a troll on TikTok who made a lewd comment about her physical appearance, per OutKick. Dunne, 20, posted a video with some of her teammates on Sunday that featured them dancing in their purple and gold leotards inside the Tigers’ locker room. In response to someone who wrote “cannonless” in the comments, Dunne replied: “I’m an athlete. I’m not perfect but I’m happy with how I look. I am blessed enough to have a healthy body that’s capable of doing amazing things:).” The response came after Dunne hit back at another TikTok critic over the weekend. In a now-deleted video reply, Dunne reportedly denounced a “Mommy” comment someone dropped on her page. “No, I’m not going to crush your skull with my thighs. Also, I’m not your mommy,” she said in the video, per The Sun. Dunne, who shared stunning photos of herself on Valentine’s Day last week, is focused on her gymnastics career — regardless of the outside noise. “How do you stay motivated to get up and do gymnastics everyday?” a fan asked in the comments of Dunne’s latest TikTok video. “I want to make the little gymnast I once was proud,” she replied. The New Jersey native is in her junior year of a four-year athletic scholarship at LSU, all the while balancing her career as a social media influencer. She has over 10 million followers across Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Dunne has become one of the top NIL earners after the NCAA announced in June 2021 that athletes can profit off of their name, image, and likeness. In October, she topped the On3 Sports list of female NIL moneymakers, which estimated her value at $2.3 million. Dunne has multiple brand deals and NIL partnerships, including Vuori clothing, College GameDay, GrubHub and American Eagle. The No. 8 Tigers defeated No. 2 Florida in Baton Rouge on Friday. LSU visits Alabama on Feb. 24.
