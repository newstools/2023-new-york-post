Grand-dame old-world apartment buildings like the Dakota, the San Remo, the El Dorado and the Beresford line Central Park West. Private homes along the well-heeled strip, however, are quite rare. Now, a Central Park West rowhouse has hit the market for $7.99 million — down from its $10.5 million price last July under a different brokerage. The 20-foot-wide limestone Neo-Renaissance residence, at 354 Central Park West, is 5,000 square feet. Built in 1892, it was designed by G.A. Schellenger and developed by Edward Kilpatrick. This was also one of five rowhouses built between 95th and 96th streets. Only two of the original remain these days, and just one is for sale. What’s more, listing broker Frances Katzen of Douglas Elliman says this is the only townhouse for sale along Central Park West. While currently divided into five free-market apartments, the property can be delivered vacant. A buyer would get a total of nine bedrooms and five bathrooms, as well as hardwood floors and Central Park views out of east-facing arched windows. The home comes with glam renderings by CSK Architects showing how a single-family residence could look — with features such as a large chef’s kitchen, a sweeping staircase and fireplaces in the living room and primary bedroom. As it stands, the property also includes a private roof deck and a finished basement. The building is also zoned mixed-use, meaning potential for a medical office downstairs with residential space above.
