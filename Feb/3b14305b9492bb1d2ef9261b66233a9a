JuJu Smith Schuster turned heads when he arrived to Super Bowl 2023. The Chiefs wide receiver rocked a light green kilt as he strolled into State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. on Sunday. Smith-Schuster, who’s known for his eye-popping fashion choices, paired the knee-length skirt with a white collared shirt with long sleeves and black boots. He accessorized with a black hat and sunglasses and carried a black bag. “This sh-t not for everybody,” the 26-year-old wideout wrote on his Instagram Story, including a photo of his pregame look. He added a graphic that said, “Paris.” The Chiefs captioned their post: “JuJu on that Super Bowl beat .” Meanwhile, Smith-Schuster’s quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, looked dapper in a patterned suit and mirrored Oakley sunglasses. The two-time NFL MVP joins Tom Brady as the only quarterback all-time to start three Super Bowls in their first six seasons. Smith-Schuster made a fashionable entrance to play in the first Super Bowl of his career. The receiver, who signed a one-year $10.75 million max deal with the Chiefs this past offseason, will earn an extra $1 million if Kansas City defeats the Eagles in Super Bowl 2023 and he plays 50 percent of the snaps. Smith-Schuster finished his first season with the Chiefs with 933 yards and three touchdowns. The former Steelers receiver, who’s set to become a free agent in the offseason, told NFL Network’s Mike Giardi on Saturday that he’s hoping to remain in Kansas City. “Yeah, I want to come back,” Smith-Schuster said. “Of course, man. Look where I’m at? I want to come back to this.”
