Alec Baldwin pleaded not guilty Thursday for his part in the on-set shooting death of “Rust” cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor will not be allowed to drink alcohol, own a gun or talk to potential witnesses besides discussing the continuation of filming the movie, court documents obtained by Page Six show. Baldwin will no longer need to appear in court Friday for his scheduled arraignment. The “30 Rock” alum was officially charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter in January for allegedly pulling the trigger on the prop gun on the New Mexico set in October 2021. The live round allegedly hit Hutchinson in the chest, killing her. The Western film’s director, Joel Souza, was also injured, but New Mexico prosecutors previously stated that no charges would be filed in relation to his wounds. Prosecutors also charged “Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who oversaw the weapons on the movie set, with the crime. Baldwin’s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday but previously told Page Six that the charge against his client was “a terrible miscarriage” of justice. Baldwin has long denied responsibility for his involvement in the tragedy. He denied accusations that he ever pulled the trigger on the prop gun, but prosecutors argued that “photos and videos clearly show Baldwin, multiple times, with his finger inside the trigger guard and on the trigger,” ahead of the deadly shooting. If convicted, Baldwin could face 18 months in prison. Despite the charges, Baldwin will continue filming the rest of the “Rust” movie.
