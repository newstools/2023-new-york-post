She wants a happier ending for her bank account. Author Teri Woods claims Amazon, Audible and other audio-book streaming companies have cheated her of $2 million in royalties by offering her tomes for free to their subscribers. Woods, who got her start selling her first big hit, “True to the Game,” out of her car trunk, has gotten a measly $8,059.63 in royalties while digital versions of her books sold millions, she charges in a Brooklyn Federal Court lawsuit. The audio books normally sell for $15 to $25, but “few readers wanted to pay $15 or more for a single audiobook when the [companies] were essentially giving them away for free to members of their streaming services,” according to court papers. Woods sold 11,058,073 books in the first half of 2021 — 11,051,733 of which were digital streams, she noted in the legal filing. “At the same time all of Teri Woods Publishing’s other revenue channels dried up,” she said in the litigation. “True to the Game,” which spawned two sequels, became a 2018 movie starring Vivica Fox.
