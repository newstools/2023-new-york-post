Hip-hop Christmas is coming early this year. From March 3-5, the annual Rolling Loud Festival is dropping into Inglewood, CA’s The Lot at Hollywood Park for three huge, rap-packed days featuring some of the genre’s biggest names like Playboi Carti, Travis Scott and Future. They’ll be joined by fellow headliners like Kodak Black, Trippie Redd, Lil Uzi Vert, 2 Chainz and Lil Baby who are all set to spit over the course of the weekend as well. That’s not all though. Legends like Lil Wayne AND Soulja Boy will be there, too. To be honest, we’re just getting started — over 100 major acts are booked over the course of the three-day extravaganza. We haven’t even mentioned City Girls, Tyga, Don Toliver, Ski Mask The Slump God and Fivio Foreign are also on the bill. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Make sure to act fast though. Last-minute tickets are available but just for a short time. While we couldn’t find single-day passes, three-day passes can still be scooped up for $285 before fees on Vivid Seats. All prices were found at the time of publication and are subject to fluctuation.  As mentioned earlier, over 100 hip-hop acts are set to perform over the course of the long weekend.
