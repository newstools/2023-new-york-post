Two Texas sisters are facing decades in prison after they threatened to shoot their neighbors dead for having loud sex. Alexis Davis, 25, and Treasure Bibbs, 21, of Houston, allegedly both pulled guns on a couple in a neighboring apartment on Feb. 13 over concerns they were making “too much noise during sex,” according to the Smoking Gun. The killjoy siblings were busted for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years behind bars, according to the outlet. The incident wasn’t the first time Davis and Bibbs had threatened to kill lovebirds Kevin Frank, 30, Kiara McPherson, 29, and their children in connection with their lusty liaisons at The Worthington development, across the highway from the George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the report said. The sisters had previously left notes on the family’s door expressing their wishes to kill them over their “too noisy” relations, the article said. Davis had previously been accused of trying to steal a 2008 Buick from a used car lot after the $8,000 vehicle was repossessed following her failure to make any payments on it, according to the report. She allegedly had broken into the car lot in the middle of the night and driven off in the car, but officials reportedly found it in front of her home after she neglected to remove its GPS tracking device. Davis was being held on $200,000 bond as she awaited a trial in connection with the grand theft auto case. Bibbs was freed on $15,000 bond.
