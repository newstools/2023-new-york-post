It’s getting heated on the Chiefs’ sideline. Star pass rusher Chris Jones was caught on camera animatedly yelling at his teammates on the Kansas City side of the field late in the first half of Super Bowl 2023, after the Chiefs’ defense gave up its third touchdown to the Eagles. Philadelphia’s quarterback, Jalen Hurts, ran in his second score of the half to make it 20-14 after the Eagles chewed up 7:19 of the play clock with the 71-yard drive — which featured a neutral zone infraction on Kansas City tackle Derrick Nnadi.

Jake Elliott tacked on the extra point and then added a field goal before the end of the half to give Philadelphia a 24-14 lead. It was a rough first half for the Chiefs’ defense, which gave up 270 total yards — 183 through the air — to Hurts and the Eagles, while racking up three penalties. Kansas City, which ranked second to their Super Bowl 2023 counterparts in total sacks on the season (70 to 55), gave up multiple plays of over 20 yards, including a 45-yards touchdown pass to wide receiver A.J. Brown. With two quarters left to go in the game, here’s hoping Jones’ teammates got his message.
