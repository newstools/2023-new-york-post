Fashion maven and “Queer Eye” star Tan France is slamming a “disturbing” beauty trend in a new documentary, where he’s also joined by Kelly Rowland. Called “Beauty and the Bleach,” the documentary follows France’s “personal mission” to take down the global trend of “skin lightening.” “Lighter means beautiful. Darker means unattractive. I was ashamed of my ethnicity, I was ashamed of my color,” France, 39, who is of Pakistani descent, says in the trailer. France grew up in England and now lives in Utah with his Mormon cowboy husband in between filming seasons of the Netflix hit “Queer Eye,” where he helps people spruce up their wardrobes. He’s also hosted other shows such as “Next in Fashion.” France’s work on “Queer Eye” shows a positive side of the beauty industry, but now he’s turning to a more negative side. The practice of “skin bleaching” has been around for a long time and is said to have side effects that are detrimental to health. In “Beauty and the Bleach,” France is also joined by former Destiny’s Child pop star Rowland, 42, who reveals in the trailer that an ex-boyfriend’s grandmother once compared her skin tone to “a paper bag, and said that I was too dark chocolate for him.” The doc follows France as he journeys from Los Angeles to his own native England, going back to his roots and interviewing people along the way who have felt the need to use the trend of skin bleach. He even talks to a man who peeled his own skin. “My hope is to teach people how to love themselves,” France says. “Beauty and the Bleach” premieres Wednesday, March 1, on Fuse and Fuse+ at 9 p.m. EST.
