Tom Brady kept his retirement under wraps for a week. Brady’s father, Tom Brady Sr., told the Boston Globe that his son revealed to him about a week ago that he was retiring from the NFL for a second time before he announced it Wednesday morning. “We’re not shocked by any means,” Brady Sr. told the outlet on Wednesday. “He has played football for 32 years out of his 45, living his dream for three-fourths of his life. It’s been a wonderful ride. He’s very secure in his decision. It’s about time.” Brady Sr. and his wife Galynn were on the field after what wound up being their son’s final game, a 31-14 first-round playoff loss to the Cowboys. Brady kissed his parents as he exited the field and entered the tunnel. It was a trying season for Brady. While the Bucs won the NFC South, their 8-9 record marked the first losing season in Brady’s 23-year NFL career. Brady also finalized a divorce with his wife, model Gisele Bündchen, with the two confirming the news in October after it had been rumored for months. The in-season split was “traumatizing” for Brady, according to ESPN NFL insider Jeff Darlington. Brady announced his retirement on Wednesday morning with a succinct message on social media. “Hey guys I’ll get to the point right away. I’m retiring. For good,” Brady said in an un-produced video that he filmed himself on the beach. “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first.”
