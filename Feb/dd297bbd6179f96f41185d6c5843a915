Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Wednesday: Giancarlo Stanton had one of the loudest hits of the day during live batting practice, drilling a bullet to left-center field against Carlos Rodon for what likely would have been a double in a real game. Rodon and DJ LeMahieu were each docked for violations of the pitch clock during live BP — Rodon for not starting his delivery on time and LeMahieu for not being ready to hit with eight seconds left on the timer. Gerrit Cole didn’t have any issues with the pitch clock, but noted one example when he was ready to pitch and still had eight seconds left, so he let it run down to two seconds before starting his windup. Asked if there might be some strategy to using extra time on the clock, Cole grinned and said, “There could be. Could be.” Nestor Cortes will be among those throwing live batting practice as the Yankees hold another workout in preparation for their Grapefruit League opener on Saturday.
