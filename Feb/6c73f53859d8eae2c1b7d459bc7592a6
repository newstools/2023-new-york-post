Artist Zoë Buckman, the British-born ex-wife of “Friends” actor David Schwimmer — the two of whom share a daughter named Cleo — is listing her Brooklyn loft. The fourth-floor Dumbo condo, at 185 Plymouth St., is on the market for $5.49 million, down from its $5.75 million ask last April. A keyed private elevator opens directly into the unit, which has been featured in shelter magazines including Architectural Digest. The 3,293-square-foot spread comes with three bedrooms (“easily convertible” to four or five) and 3½ baths. It features original wood beams and exposed brick walls, along with a modern glass window wall, oak floors, a living room — and an open chef’s kitchen that leads to a private deck with East River and city skyline views. The building was formerly a turn-of-the-century Brillo factory that converted to a luxury 10-unit condo in 2014. Amenities include a gym, a bike room, a package room and a virtual doorman. “The loft will forever hold a special place in my heart, as it’s where I made my best work to date,” Buckman told Gimme Shelter, adding that she is selling because she “needed separation between where I lived and where I worked.” Buckman now lives in “a beautiful home in Bed-Stuy,” adding, “I doubt I’ll ever have a studio again with as much abundant natural light as I had in Dumbo.” She is currently working on her first New York City solo show since 2019, which will be held at contemporary gallery Lyles & King in September. Buckman and Schwimmer married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. That year, Buckman bought the Dumbo condo for $4.57 million. Schwimmer still owns an East Village townhouse at 331 E. Sixth St., which he bought for $3.9 million in 2010, according to property records. But he didn’t make any friends in the ‘hood when he razed the 1852 property just as it was on track for landmark status. The listing brokers are Callie Katt and Eric Sidman of Compass.
