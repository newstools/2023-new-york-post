Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis slammed calls for a ban on gas stoves as an example of government overreach on Thursday while proposing a state tax exemption for the appliances. The Republican governor — and likely GOP frontrunner for president if he elects to run in 2024 — backed an abolishment on sales tax for gas stove purchases within the state as he weighed in on the red-hot issue. “They want to control every single aspect of your life,” DeSantis said during during a press conference for his proposed “Framework for Freedom” budget. “They want to be able to determine what type of energy you’re allowed to use, how much energy you’re allowed to use.” “This is all part of a larger scheme. In the state of Florida, we’re saying ‘don’t tread on us’ on this. We’re going to stand for people’s freedoms,” DeSantis added. The use of gas stoves sparked a firestorm last month after Consumer Product Safety Commission boss Richard Trumka Jr. told Bloomberg that the feds were mulling a nationwide ban on the appliances. He cited safety concerns related to harmful emissions linked to the stoves that can cause health problems. Trumka’s comments led to an outcry from critics who slammed the potential move as federal meddling. After facing fierce pushback, Trumka backed off the claim and said any regulation would only “apply to new products.” As The Post reported, Trumka’s remarks also drew a response from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which noted that gas stoves were “more affordable” and touted the need to preserve “consumer choice.” DeSantis expanded on his reason for joining the debate in a video from his budget presentation posted on his Twitter account. “It’s just the principle of, this is ridiculous. And they do want to go after it. They got blowback so they kind of had to back off. They want to go after the gas stoves and so we’re saying we want you to be able to buy those free of charges from the state of Florida,” DeSantis said.
