Rep. George Santos continues to spin his web of lies. George Santos, 34, allegedly once told investors of his 2021 congressional campaign that he invested in the infamous Broadway production of “Spider-man: Turn off the Dark” which became one of the most expensive flops in Broadway history, reports Bloomberg. If true, Santos — who has been caught in numerous lies over the past few weeks including ones regarding his education, work history, and the claim his mother died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks — would have been the youngest Broadway producer in history at the age of 21 or 22. The title of “youngest producer” is held by Amanda Lipitz, who produced the 2005 original production of “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” at the age of 24. “Of all the tribulations the producers of ‘Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark’ had to endure,” said show spokesperson Rick Miramontez to Entertainment Weekly. “We are very pleased, proud and relieved to report working with George Santos was not one of them.” The troubled New York representative’s name also does not show up on the show’s playbill or on the Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) profile. One of the show’s actual producers, Michael Cohl, also confirmed to Bloomberg that Santos had nothing to do with the show. “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” slung its way onto Broadway in 2011 featuring music and lyrics from Bono and was delayed several times and holds the record for the longest number of preview performances (almost 180). The show ran for nearly three years and injured six actors before closing in January 2014.
