If you’re like half of Americans, you may struggle with cooking homemade meals. Maybe it’s because you don’t have the time or knowledge to get started, but it could also be that you don’t have the proper tools. Buying cheap knives could be dangerous or a waste of money, and quality knives aren’t always expensive. The Seido Japanese Master Chef’s Knife Set comes with five high-carbon steel knives. This set is selling at the price drop of $99.99, originally $249, as part of this Presidents’ Day sale. These knives are affordable and designed to be some of the highest-quality kitchen knives on the market. They are noticeably sharper than Western-style knives, with an edge angle of only 15 degrees versus the usual 25 degrees. Sharp blades are actually safer to use than dull knives because it takes less force to make the cuts. This may make the experience of learning to cook safer, easier, and overall a more enjoyable experience. Seido’s knives were made to encourage home cooks to prepare better meals and are built to last. You will receive all the essential sizes: an 8” chef’s knife, that is a great everyday knife, a 7” cleaver that acts like a butcher knife, and a 3.5” paring knife. You may use them for anything from hacking up bones to crushing garlic to peeling an apple. Imagine all of the beautiful meals you could cook for yourself, family, and friends. If you need a gift for anyone, these knives may be the perfect choice. You could be giving something practical that would be used every day, likely for years to come. The set comes in a gift box, so you wouldn’t even have to worry about wrapping it. Be sure to grab one before this sale runs out! Treat yourself to the Seido Japanese Master Chef’s five piece knife set for $100 (reg. $249), now through February 20. Prices subject to change.
