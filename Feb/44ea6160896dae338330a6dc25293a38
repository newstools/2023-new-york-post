Ben Affleck runs on Dunkin’. Dunkin’s first-ever Super Bowl commercial stars its biggest supporter, along with a cameo from his wife, Jennifer Lopez, 53. The coffee company first teased the commercial with the 50-year-old actor on Instagram last week, with a video that says, “Something’s Ben Brewing.” In January, Affleck filmed at a Dunkin’ location in Medford, Mass., where he was working at the drive-thru window, serving coffee and donuts to customers who were caught off guard by his appearance. In the commercial, Affleck sported an employee uniform with a black visor and shirt that said “America runs on Dunkin’.” He’s seen in the ad wearing a headset and taking orders, struggling to work the company’s ordering system. Of course, many of the unexpected customers immediately recognized the star — though one admitted Affleck didn’t look familiar to him. One customer happens to be Affleck’s wife, Lopez, who questions, “What are you doing here? Is this what you do when you say you’re going to work all day?” Affleck, who just got caught, then declares to his off-camera co-workers that he has to go. But before he can leave, Lopez quips, “Grab me a glazed.” At the time, a customer said that the “Argo” star handed them back their money and gave out orders for free. Another told NBC 10 Boston that he was “quick-witted and funny” as a Dunkin’ employee. As expected, fans were loving the commercial just as much as Affleck loves his Dunkin’ coffee. “Ben Affleck’s Dunkin’ Donuts commercial was both wholly predictable and inevitable and… everything I wanted it to be,” one person said. “The Ben Affleck Dunkin’ Donuts commercial is the greatest thing ever filmed!!!!!!” another wrote. Affleck is well-known as a Dunkin’ lover ever, especially after a 2020 photo of him dropping an order of coffee went viral and became a meme. He recently became a meme after the 2023 Grammys for looking miserable — with many people joking he needed a Dunkin’ coffee to keep him alert.
