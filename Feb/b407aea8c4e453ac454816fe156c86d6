President Biden’s former press secretary Jen Psaki will host a weekly Sunday show on MSNBC, the network announced on Tuesday. “Inside with Jen Psaki” will debut at noon on Sunday, March 19 — more than 10 months after Biden’s first mouthpiece left the White House. “We have been working on some fun and different features … and can’t wait to dig into all of the news,” Psaki tweeted. “See you soon.” Psaki served as Biden’s press secretary for 16 months, where she was known for her sassy — and often condescending — quips and showmanship that’s been lacking in the briefing room since her departure. The new show will “leverage Psaki’s wide-ranging expertise to tackle the biggest issues of the week, featuring one-on-one interviews with newsmakers,” MSNBC said in a statement. Each Sunday, she “will break down and make sense of the most complex public policy discussions happening in the Nation’s Capital from the debt ceiling to the political campaign trail to the war in Ukraine and more,” the left-leaning network said. Psaki will also appear on election-night programming and remain a contributor to NBC’s “Today” and “Meet the Press.” Psaki stirred controversy after it was revealed that she had taken a job with MSNBC while still acting as Biden’s press secretary, as many felt it was a conflict of interest as she answered questions from future network rivals. Karine Jean-Pierre, a former MSNBC political analyst, replaced Psaki at the White House.
