“Cocaine Bear” snorted its way to the top of the box office on Friday. On its opening night, it raked in $8.65 million, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. The comedy, which is directed by Elizabeth Banks, whom The Post said, “keeps the powder gags fresh throughout,” is loosely based on a true story of a black bear in Georgia that ate millions of dollars worth of lost cocaine. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” which was in first place last week, creeped to second with an $8.3 million-dollar take. The plummet in sales for the superhero flick, which cost around $200 million to make, marks the worst-ever second-week drop for a Marvel film, according to Deadline. Remaining in third was “Avatar: The Way of Water” with $1.1 million in sales. With the success of the film, a sequel to the 2009’s “Avatar,” director James Cameron now only has to surpass Steven Spielberg to become the highest-grossing director of all time,  Screenrant reported. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” the final chapter of the Channing Tatum-led stripping trilogy, came in fourth, taking home $905,000. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which was in fourth place last Friday, hissed its way down to fifth this week, earning $890,000.
