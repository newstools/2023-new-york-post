He’s the king of blocking out the haters. King Charles III ignored protesters with “Not My King” signs during a royal engagement Thursday in southeast England. The 74-year-old monarch went to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire to mark its new status as a city, but when he arrived at the Church of Christ the Cornerstone, he was met with some unfriendly faces. The bright yellow “Not My King” signs didn’t seem to bother King Charles as he shook hands and greeted other members of the public. Around 20 protesters showed up at the venue, according to Daily Express correspondent Richard Palmer. The protests — which were reportedly organized by the group Republic, which also has plans to protest Charles’ coronation — were drowned out by chants of “God Save the King,” as seen in a video from Heart News East. This wasn’t the first time Charles paid no mind to his detractors. On multiple occasions, the king has been pelted with eggs by critics. In November 2022, Charles and Queen Consort Camilla arrived in York, England, for an official visit, when a protester lobbed several eggs at him, barely missing. But Charles seemed unbothered and continued to greet the public as the eggs were hurled toward him, landing on the ground near his foot. He barely acknowledged the incident — just briefly pausing to look at the cracked shells. In another incident in December 2022, the king had an egg hurled at him during a walkabout in Luton, England. Charles didn’t crack after that egging incident either and shook hands with the public after being moved to a different location.
