When the Rangers acquired All-Star forward Vladimir Tarasenko from the Blues in a blockbuster trade earlier this month, the winger’s wife, Yana Tarasenko, celebrated his new chapter on Broadway. Taking to Instagram at the time, the model — who has been married to Taransenko since 2015 — shared a handful of photos of their family sporting his No. 91 Rangers jersey outside Madison Square Garden. “New York here we come,” Yana gushed. With Taransenko now calling New York home, get to know the winger’s biggest supporter as the Rangers’ push toward the postseason continues. Tarasenko’s love story with Yana began in 2014. Although the pair had “socialized among mutual friends,” in Novosibirsk, Russia, according to ESPN, Tarasenko knew he had to take matters into his own hands. “We met at a karaoke bar,” Tarasenko recalled to the outlet. “Nobody sang. I was too shy to talk to her, so needed to relax a little, so we go there.” The couple tied the knot a year later. Tarasenko is a father of three. Not only is the 31-year-old a proud stepfather to Yana’s son Mark, but he and his wife share sons Aleksandr and Artem, the latter of whom they welcomed in June 2019, the same year Tarasenko and the Blues won the Stanley Cup. Both Tarasenko and Yana shared photos of their newborn son in the Cup on Instagram following his birth. Last February, Tarasenko’s youngest children playfully crashed his postgame press conference, with the athlete calling them his “support team” for the Q&A. A model who has appeared on international covers for Maxim and Grazia, among others, Yana frequently shares images from her photo shoots on Instagram, where she boasts nearly 70,000 followers. Her page, which also features family-centric pics, is dedicated to “health, beauty, and sport,” per her bio.
