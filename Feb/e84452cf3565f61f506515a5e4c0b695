FBI agents arrived at former Vice President Mike Pence’s Indiana home Friday to search for additional classified documents, more than three weeks after Pence turned over two boxes of records marked as sensitive to the bureau. A police car blocked off the driveway leading to Pence’s home in Carmel, a northern suburb of Indianapolis, as reporters swarmed around the front gate. Investigators took possession of the two boxes of records Jan. 19, when Pence was in Washington for the annual March for Life. A day earlier, Pence attorney Greg Jacob had informed the National Archives that the documents were located Jan. 16. On Jan. 27, in his first public comments about the discovery, Pence told an audience at Florida International University in Miami: “While I was not aware that the classified documents were in our personal residence, let me be clear, those classified documents should not have been in my personal residence. Mistakes were made and I take full responsibility.” Pence, a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has tried to draw a contrast between his handling of the records and the Biden administration, which took more than two months to inform the public that classified documents had been discovered Nov. 2 at the president’s former think tank office in Washington. Since then, more secret documents dating to President Biden’s time as a senator and Barack Obama’s vice president have been found at his residence in Wilmington, Del. The FBI search of Pence’s home came hours after he was reportedly subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating former President Donald Trump’s own handling of classified documents following his presidency, as well as the 76-year-old’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot.
