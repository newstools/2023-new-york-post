Sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell will contest her conviction after winning a $1 million divorce deal, a report said. The convicted predator is setting her sights on freedom after papers were filed with a US judge awarding her the hefty settlement in her soon-to-be-finalized divorce from husband Scott Borgerson, a source told The Sun. “Ghislaine has long been waiting for her appeal and she believes she has a technically strong case,” the insider told the outlet. “However, even if her appeal is successful she wouldn’t have enough cash to fund a retrial.” Maxwell, an associate and former girlfriend of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, has been behind bars since December 2021 for her role in his perverted scheme. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Her bid for freedom may come at a $10 million cost, another insider told the Daily Mail. Last month, Maxwell hired Harvey Weinstein’s appeals lawyer to fight the battle. The disgraced socialite, 61, claimed in 2020 that she and tech CEO Borgerson were only getting divorced in order to “protect” him from “being associated with her.” Though Borgerson lobbied for her bail release ahead of the trial, he reportedly refused to release funds to pay for her appeal or her legal bills. Borgerson has been in charge of his estranged wife’s finances for the last several years and has been since selling off millions worth of property. Now, their divorce settlement will leave Maxwell just $1 million out of her estimated $20 million net worth. “The papers for the divorce have been filed but it’s come at a price,” The Sun source said. ‘Ghislaine used to live a life of unimaginable luxury of private jets and luxury yachts. But now, between her legal bills and the divorce, she is broke.”
