Look ma, no hands! A TikToker, who goes by @fat..girl98, joined the boob lift challenge and recently showed off her skills by hoisting a table and two chairs — with just her breasts. Her video capturing the feat has raked in more than 13.8 million views. “[A]lright thats enough!! Tit•tok got a hold on me. Got me picking up everything around the house,” she captioned the viral clip from Feb. 10. Inspired by another TikToker, the woman first started with a table — in a clip that hit 2 million views — before progressing to the table with two chairs after realizing the strength of her melons. Towards the end of her viral video, the Tiktoker spread out her arms to show viewers what she’s working with. The woman decided to participate in the challenge after seeing another boob lifter, Joss, known as @joss_maura on TikTok, lift a plastic storage container. Another Tiktoker, Keyona, who goes by @keyonat@3 on the social media site, stunned viewers by lifting a 45-pound barbell. That clip garnered 54.8 million views. The originator of the challenge is Vanessa, known as @chill_kids21 on TikTok, who started the trend in October last year. Ahead of getting a breast reduction, she started testing the strength of her boobs. She began posting a series of videos — from a 10-pound table to a 22-pound laundry basket. The TikToker even placed a Shark vacuum cleaner underneath her knockers and raised one leg from the ground. As she removes the vacuum from her chest and says, “that one hurt.”
