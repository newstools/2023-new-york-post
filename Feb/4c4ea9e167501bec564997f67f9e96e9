She was shooting her shot. Channing Tatum had an interesting encounter when he went for a dentist appointment that left him a little perplexed. During his visit to the dentist, Tatum, 42, was asked to strip off all his clothes. “Not my actual dentist, but the woman that is the dentist’s assistant — the tech lady — I come in, and she’s like, ‘I’ll take your jacket,’” the “Magic Mike” star said in an interview with On Demand Entertainment. He continued, “I take off my jacket, give it to her. And she said, ‘You can take the rest of it off.’ I was like, what? Am I supposed to get in like a gown or something like that? It’s a dentist. You’re doing my teeth, right?” Tatum didn’t know what to do or how to respond, so he just laughed until the dental assistant broke the silence. “She thankfully broke the moment, and was like, ‘ha ha ha, but you can take it off if you wanted,’” he shared. “Then, she left the room. Now I know that I’m going to be literally laying on this table, and she’s going to be in my mouth.” The enthusiastic dental assistant wasn’t going to get any stripping from Tatum in the dentist’s office, but could catch a glimpse of what she was looking for by seeing “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” which hits theaters this Friday. In the third and final installment of the “Magic Mike” franchise directed by Steven Soderbergh, Tatum’s Mike Lane is left bartending in Florida after a failed business deal. He hooks up with a wealthy socialite (Salma Hayek) who takes him to London with an offer to headline a dance show.
