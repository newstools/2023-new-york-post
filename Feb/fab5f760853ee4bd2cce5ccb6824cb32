Dallas fans have another opportunity to watch Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving in action when the Mavericks host the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night. bet365 Sportsbook favors Dallas by 6.5 points at home and that seems reasonable even though the Mavericks haven’t been playing their best basketball as of late. Dallas has lost four of its last five games, the worst being Sunday’s home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in which the Mavericks allowed the Lakers to pull off a 27-point comeback. Still, their recent defeats came to decent teams (SAC, MIN, DEN, LAL), and a lesser Indiana team presents an opportunity to get back on track. The Pacers aren’t terrible with players like Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton, but they probably don’t have the firepower to keep up with Doncic and Irving powering the Mavericks. Dallas should bring its best effort to keep pace in the Western Conference and get back in the win column, so back the Mavericks on bet365 Sportsbook with bonus code NYP365.
