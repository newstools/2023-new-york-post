Former Mets great Carlos Beltran is getting another chance with the club. Sources tell The Post the Mets are hiring their former star center fielder to join their front office, where he will work under GM Billy Eppler. It isn’t clear what Beltran’s duties will be yet, but he is a well-regarded baseball mind as well as a former superstar player. Beltran’s hiring comes three years after he was hired as Mets manager then fired after he was linked to the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal. Mets manager Buck Showalter considered Beltran for his coaching staff a year ago and this offseason as assistant hitting coach. Beltran recently informed YES Network that he was leaving his broadcast job with them. Andrew Marchand reported in The Post there were plans to move Beltran from broadcasting games into the studio to do pre- and post-game duties. The Mets couldn’t be reached for comment.
