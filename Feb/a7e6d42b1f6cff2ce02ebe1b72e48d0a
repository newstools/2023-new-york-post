Big money on the Big Game is starting to roll in. One bettor put down $1 million on the Eagles to win Super Bowl 2023 at BetMGM Sportsbook, according to Action Network’s Darren Rovell, via BetMGM spokesperson Elisa Richardson. It is the first reported seven-figure bet on this year’s Super Bowl, per ESPN’s David Purdum. At a -125 moneyline, the bet will pay $800,000 if Philadelphia pulls off the win. If the Chiefs take home the Lombardi Trophy, the bettor leaves with nothing. The Eagles and Chiefs will meet in Super Bowl 2023 on Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Kansas City opened as two-point favorites but have moved to one-and-a-half-point underdogs as of this writing.
