Social media sleuths have been sent into a frenzy after a mystery body part washed up on an idyllic tourist beach. Beachgoer Tammy Threlfall posted a picture of what appeared to be a bloody and severed human finger on Monday afternoon, after she had been sent the image by a friend who was at Port Douglas’ Four Mile Beach in Far North Queensland, Australia. After posting the image on Facebook’s buy/sell portal Marketplace – for the price of $764– users suggested Ms. Threlfall report the disembodied digit to local police so it could be forensically tested. However, a trip to the beach with her friend to locate the finger again confirmed what some had suspected — the “finger” was nothing more than a rubber novelty. “My friend saw it on the beach and took a picture so I posted it,” said Ms. Threlfall. “We went and looked at it again and it was rubber.” “At the end of the day it was just a bit of fun,” she said.
