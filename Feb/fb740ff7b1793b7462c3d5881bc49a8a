Adrian Peterson believes Damar Hamlin’s Super Bowl wardrobe was blasphemous. Hamlin sat next to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell at Super Bowl 2023, and wore a Takashi Murakami “Travis Jesus” jacket that said, “Without the end or beginning there is no day and there is no night.” The jacket also had a graphic picture of a crucifix on the back. Peterson thought that Hamlin, the Bills safety who survived a very public cardiac arrest incident on the field when the Bills took on the Bengals in Week 17, was disrespecting God with the jacket. “You should be thanking God son!” Peterson wrote a caption on Instagram. “This is Blasphemy!! We all fall short but cmon man! I find this disrespectful!! #grateful #goddid” Peterson played running back in the NFL from 2007-21 and is the league’s fifth all-time leading rusher. Fred Taylor, the former Pro Bowl running back, thought that Peterson should have handled this matter privately. “You should DM him bro,” Taylor wrote in the comments. “I’m sure he’d listen to your opinion. Posting it doesn’t help anyone. He’s young, young ppl don’t always think before they wear things just like people who wear skulls and other things that doesn’t align with Christian beliefs. Try to reach him.” About six weeks after his cardiac arrest incident, Hamlin said that he still hopes to play football again in the future. “Eventually. That’s always the goal, like I said, as a competitor, you know, I’m trying to do things to keep advancing my situation,” Hamlin said Sunday night. “But I’m allowing that to be in God’s hands. I’m just thankful he gave me a second chance.” Doctors, however, have been primarily concerned with Hamlin living a normal life, and have not as of yet prioritized football. “It’s a tough situation,” Hamlin continued. “They can’t really tell, because it’s like — it’s an up-to-me thing I guess or, you know, it’s just — it’s a long road. They’re just worried about trying to get me back to normal as much as they can.”
