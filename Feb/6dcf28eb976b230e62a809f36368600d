If you’re looking for a deal to charge you up in more ways than one, we have just the product for you. It may be a little early in the season to think about a camping trip, but as campers know (because they regularly see wildlife, and because camping doesn’t always lend itself to the best night’s sleep) the early bird gets the worm. Similarly, the early bear catches the salmon, the early bee gets the best pollen, the early squirrel gets the best nut, and so on and so forth. The above is just a sampling of the animals you might see on your next camping trip, made complete by your brand new Portable Power Station from Jackery, now on sale for 31% off on Amazon. The Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 300 is a super-fast, super-safe way to stay connected, even when you’re off the grid. Whether it’s a camping trip, a power outage, or a weather emergency, make sure you always have access to power, and save, with the Explorer 300, now $90 off on Amazon. With the Explorer 300, you can charge up to six devices, including laptops, phones, and more, at the same time as the Explorer itself.
