The horrifying 911 call from a fatal and freak alligator attack on a woman has been released. According to TMZ, a distressed onlooker dialed the emergency hotline as the 10-foot alligator caught the 85-year-old in its jaws. “There’s a woman in the lake. The alligator’s got her!” said the terrified caller, who phoned while watching Gloria Serge fight for her life. “He pulled her into the lake,” the caller continued as the gator dragged its victim into the water. According to previous reports, the Florida woman was walking her dog at the Fort Pierce retirement community, Spanish Lakes Fairways, on Monday when the vicious reptile struck. Apparently the alligator, which is estimated to weigh between 600 and 700 pounds, attempted to chomp down on the unsuspecting pooch and Serge stepped in to save her fur baby. But the woman was not as lucky as her pet, which survived the attack. When the 911 dispatcher asked if the alligator had pulled the woman under the water, the anonymous caller answered, “Yes.” “I think she’s gone, oh my God,” the onlooker added after a few minutes of watching the tragedy unfold, and then witnessed Serge’s lifeless body come to the surface. Alligator wrangler Robert Lilly, who was called to the scene to catch the gator, said that “it was definitely a fight.” “[We] snagged him on the bottom. He never surfaced. He stayed down the whole time,” Lilly previously told Florida’s WPTV, adding that they were eventually able to “get him up.”
