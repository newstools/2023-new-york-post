Every couple knows you can spend months planning a wedding down to the last little detail and things can still go awry. Thankfully an Aussie bride saw the funny side when things went horribly wrong with her wedding cake. “I got married last week and it was perfect it all went great, except for this one thing,” Taylor Hunt shared in her viral TikTok video. “This is the cake we ordered, she’s gorg. The (bakers) were like ‘yep, easy’.” Taylor and her groom opted for a simple buttercream frosted cake decorated with the word “amore” across the side. However, when it got to the big day, Taylor had no idea they had ended up with something very different. “So no one actually checked the cake before it was cake time, and we didn’t have an official cake-cutting moment…thank God! Because this is the cake we got,” Taylor explained through giggles. “Like, what is that?” Instead, the couple ended up with a slightly lop-sided naked cake with the words ‘my darling’ on a chocolate disc, that had broken off in one corner. “The funniest part is that my mum was in charge of the cake and she got on the phone right away and text the baker a picture and was like, ‘did we get the wrong cake?’” People were horrified by the cake Taylor ended up with – even more so when she revealed the baker’s response. Not only did the baker not give them a refund, instead giving a discount, they told Taylor: “It was the right cake, they just ‘missed some details’.” “Missed every single detail more like, I mean technically it is cake but that’s about it,” one person joked. “That literally makes no sense whatsoever…in what realm is that even remotely close? They definitely didn’t finish it, that has to be what happened,” another responded. “Did mom accidentally attach the wrong reference picture?” questioned another. “A discount?! As a bakery business owner that’d be a full refund and sobbing apology,” said one person. Another added: “I know you’re laughing but oh my god. That would ruin my day.”
