Once the priciest home in Houston, a sprawling French-style chateau is set to relist late Thursday,  The Post can exclusively reveal. The incredible property, located at 100 Carnarvon Drive in the city’s swanky Bayou Woods subdivision, made headlines back in 2014 when it hit the market for $43 million. At the time, it was the highest-ever asking price for a private residence in the city, but it failed to find a buyer and the sum was subsequently slashed to $30 million. Now, a little over a year since the listing was last removed from the market, the opulent estate is back and asking an epic $36 million. Clocking in at more than 26,000 square feet, the property’s interior was designed by the late David Easton and combines modern neoclassical and impressionistic French styles. “Inspired by Europe’s palatial estates, 100 Carnarvon Drive is an unparalleled Houston residence,” Douglas Elliman agent Gigi Huang, who holds the 2.33-acre listing, told The Post of the compound. Exceptional details include “a Parisian styled pool, hand painted domed tall ceiling, floral chandelier and French details throughout.” There’s also an array of salons, galleries, gardens and artisan European craftsmanship to be enjoyed. The home features eight bedrooms, with the master suite coming complete with a private terrace and a sumptuous “spa” bathroom. The seller, Quantlab Financial co-founder Wilbur “Ed” Bosarge, Jr., purchased the property through a trust in 2010, but construction on the home was not completed until two years later, the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Bosarge, a billionaire known for wearing a beret, is famed for throwing decadent parties. He hit headlines in 2020 after his divorce from wife of 22 years, Marie Bosarge, turned messy.
