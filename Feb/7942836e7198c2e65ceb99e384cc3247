Is LinkedIn the new Tinder? Apparently, for some people it is, as one woman on TikTok revealed that a man slid into her DMs, asking her on a date via LinkedIn, the popular business and employment social media platform. User Hannah Harmelin shared more about the incident in a viral video that has more than 741,000 views. It sparked a debate between commenters over whether or not it was an acceptable modern-day dating practice. “Hey Hannah–skipping the line on a dating app and coming straight to you,” the man’s message read, as seen in her video. “Aggressive move, ikik.” The message continued: “Life’s too short not to go for what I am highly interested in. Happy to connect regardless of your openness to meet.” To top it all off, the mystery man signed his note, “Kindest regards.” “This mans really came to my LINKEDIN,” she wrote in blue text over the 5-second clip, which also featured Harmelin sliding a pair of black sunglasses onto her face. The Post has reached out to Harmelin for a statement. In the comments section of her video, many users called out the man for his bold inquiry, with one even labeling it as “honestly a red flag,” with another agreeing, writing, “Sir I use this to further my career not find a hookup.” “I’m unsure about this, prefer to keep it professional on LinkedIn,” someone else admitted. “I would still find it weird because LinkedIn is not a dating app,” one person typed. Others, however, praised him for it — and, further, urged Harmelin to give the guy a chance. A user suggested, “Maybe I’m just toxic but I’m obsessed with this and you should definitely give him a chance lol.” One TikToker commented, “The way i would immediately fall for him.” Another was tickled by his sign-off. “Kindest regards, who says romance is dead 🥹,” they wrote. Someone else even revealed that they had done the same thing before, recalling, “LOL, did it once. The girl accepted my invitation, read the message, and then removed me! We need to know what happened next and ur feedback!!” This isn’t the first time someone has used an unconventional method to try to online date–one couple found love on the language-learning app Duolingo and ended up tying the knot last month. Others are turning to Venmo, a mobile payment app, to try to shoot their shot. In one instance, someone paid a woman $5 in order to try to get her phone number.
