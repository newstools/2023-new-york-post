Just as we love it when a restaurant replaces a bank in a retail location, we love it when an actual store replaces a storefront office. Canadian fashion designer Tanya Taylor is launching her first brick-and-mortar boutique at 980 Madison Ave. in a space previously occupied by Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The shop will have about 2,800 square feet on two levels. The RFR-owned building opposite the Carlyle Hotel between East 76th and 77th streets is home to the Gagosian Gallery and restaurant Kappo Masa. Leasing firm MONA, which was founded by RFR, represented the landlord. Newmark repped Tanya Taylor. The asking rent was $775 per square foot. Also at 980 Madison, women’s contemporary line Veronica Beard is doubling its space by adding 1,237 square feet on the ground and 814 sf in the lower level. The Third Avenue doldrums haven’t affected Blackrock and L&L Holding Company’s 600 Third Ave. between East 39th and East 40th streets. The tower is 94% leased and in a further sign of vitality, law firm Polsinelli PIC is upping it presence there. Polsinelli extended its lease by 10 years through 2036. It also expanded by 13,129 square feet, raising its total to 56,516 sf — the tower’s largest tenant. L&L, which bought the property in 2004, upgraded the lobby and building systems and redesigned its public plaza and park space. Polsinelli was repped by a CBRE team. L&L’s David Berkey acted for the landlord in-house.
