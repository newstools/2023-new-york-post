There’s a chance Super Bowl 2023 is Andy Reid’s last game. Fox Sports’ Jay Glazer said during the Fox pregame show that the Chiefs head coach didn’t say no when asked if Sunday’s contest could be his last game. “I’m not getting any younger,” Reid told Glazer. “I still have a young quarterback. I have a decision I have to make after this game.” Seldom do coaches get as lucky as Reid — who will turn 65 next month — with Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback. Mahomes, 27, won his second NFL MVP and led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl in five years as the starter this season. The Kansas City head coaching job would be among the most coveted in the league and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy would perhaps be a top candidate. Glazer later added that Reid said he was “just trying to enjoy every moment this week, which [he] really didn’t do in the past.” “Just got off the phone with Andy and he said, ‘Well, look, the biggest difference between this Super Bowl for me and in years past, I’m trying to enjoy these,” Glazer said. “In the past, I’d just go business, business and I really wouldn’t look at certain things to enjoy. All the way back to the AFC Championship game, I stayed up until 5:30 in the morning returning all these texts to everybody who are just congratulating me’ until his wife Tammy said hey, he had to get to bed, you’re too old to stay up to 5:30 in the morning.” Reid has already cemented himself as a Hall of Famer as he is set to coach his fourth Super Bowl and third with the Chiefs. He can add a second Super Bowl ring with a win, and become just the 14th coach ever to do it. Reid is in his 10th season with Kansas City, after previously spending 14 seasons as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. Reid is fifth in NFL history in games coached (386) and wins (247).
