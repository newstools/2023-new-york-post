The Post’s experts predict Sunday’s Super Bowl battle between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs: Eagles 33, Chiefs 30: The two best teams in the NFL made it to the big game, and it should be a classic. It is always scary to pick against Patrick Mahomes, but the Eagles are better at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and that is where they will win this game. Chiefs 24, Eagles 21: The Eagles have the more talented team, top-to-bottom. The Chiefs have the coach unafraid to inject a crazy call into the game and the quarterback who invents new tricks in the moment. A fake kick or no-look pass makes the difference. Chiefs 31, Eagles 27: The Eagles are a damn good team, and Jalen Hurts is a damn good quarterback. But Patrick Mahomes is the best player in the sport, and his Super Bowl experience will help him here. Mahomes to Kelce will be the difference. Eagles 31, Chiefs 23: The Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes, which means they always have a chance. The Eagles have the advantage in most other areas, though — especially up front — and it will take a meltdown from young QB Jalen Hurts to derail the Birds. Eagles 30, Chiefs 27: Patrick Mahomes is as close to 100 percent as his high ankle sprain will allow him to be, but he’ll be working his jaw-dropping magic against a better defense than the one Jalen Hurts will begoing against. Hurts will be a dual threat. Mahomes cannot be. Chiefs 27, Eagles 21: The Eagles have barely broken a sweat in two playoff victories. But Patrick Mahomes is on the doorstep of adding a second ring to his legacy. That’s the trump card.
