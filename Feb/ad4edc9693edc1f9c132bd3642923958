J.J. Watt announced his retirement in December but its seems as if he still has some paperwork to finish. The former All-Pro defensive end shared a text he received from an NFL representative Tuesday morning about being selected for a drug test. “This is Dillon on behalf of the NFL,” the message read. “You have been selected for a high dry blood spot test, please give me a call or shoot me a text when you can. Thank you.” Watt opted to poke fun at the situation. “I don’t know what happens when you click ‘Report Junk’,” Watt tweeted. “but I think I’m about to find out…” Brian Peters, Watt’s former teammate and now fellow retired NFL player commented “Respond ‘Unsubscribe'” under the tweet. He might have some experience with receiving unwanted texts from the NFL after retirement as well. It’s not all that surprising since the former Cardinals and Texans star has yet to fill out his retirement paperwork. Earlier this month he tweeted he was surprised it even existed in response to the news that Tom Brady had submitted his papers to the league. “I was unaware there was paperwork…” Watt tweeted on Feb, 10. “Definitely not gonna fill that out, but definitely retired.” Of course, taking a drug test would have been old hat for the 33-year-old, a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and a five-time first-team All-Pro. Watt previously shared a screengrab of a December text message — also from Dillon — telling him he’d been selected for a urine test following a three-sack, three-tackle outing against the Broncos. “I think I’ve been ‘randomly selected’ after every 3 sack game of my career,” he wrote, adding crying-laughing and face-palm emoji. The NFL most likely won’t make Watt take any tests as he enters a new chapter of his life with wife Kealia Ohai and their four-month-old son Koa James, but filling out those retirement papers may be on top of his list now.
