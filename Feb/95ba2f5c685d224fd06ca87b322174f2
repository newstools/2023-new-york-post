Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Monday: Ian Hamilton, a 27-year-old righty, was dominant during a perfect sixth inning in which he threw eight pitches — all strikes — in the Yankees’ 8-5 win over the Tigers at Steinbrenner Field on Monday night. Hamilton struck out two Detroit hitters, who swung at six pitches and whiffed four times. Oswaldo Cabrera, playing third base, was charged with an error after letting a bouncing ball from Spencer Torkelson get by him on a tough hop. The super utilityman bounced back, though, robbing Eric Haase of extra bases with a diving catch to his right. Tayler Aguilar, a 22-year-old up from minor league camp, made a strong throw from right field to nail Detroit’s Colt Keith at the plate. Gleyber Torres, Jose Trevino and Oswald Peraza will be among the Yankees making the trip to Orlando for a game against the Rays at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports.
