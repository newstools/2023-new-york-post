Things are a whole lot easier for the Arizona Cardinals if they want to trade DeAndre Hopkins. Due to his six-game suspension for using PEDs in 2022, the no-trade clause in his contract is ineffective, according to CBS Sports’ Joel Corry, a former sports agent. With the Cardinals on the cusp of rebuilding as they head into 2023 with a new head coach and an injured quarterback, the possibility of dealing Hopkins in a trade is increasingly likely. If the Cardinals are indeed tearing it down, trading Hopkins would likely bring back draft picks and give Arizona some breathing room in clearing out around $20 million of cap space. Numerous teams have been linked with Hopkins — a five-time Pro Bowler and three-time first-time All-Pro — especially in an offseason with a shallow free-agent wide receiver class. The Patriots have been a popular name surrounding a Hopkins trade mostly because they lack wide receiver talent and have no true WR1, even if they were to hang on to pending free agent Jakobi Meyers. Landing someone like Hopkins would — most likely — elevate the play of Mac Jones, who struggled in his second NFL season. Depending on how the contract situation unfolds with Lamar Jackson, the Ravens are another team in desperate need of a star receiver. Pairing Hopkins with star tight end Mark Andrews, to go with the elusiveness and toughness of the Ravens rushing attack, would make for a fearsome offense. Another team that has been linked with Hopkins is the Bears, who will have a league-high $111.6 million to play with this offseason. With Justin Fields having a breakout season on the ground and looking to be on the brink of stardom heading into this third NFL year, a weapon like Hopkins could help bring his game full circle. Other teams who have been mentioned are the Chargers and Jaguars who have young, talented quarterbacks and budding offenses. Bringing in a stud veteran wide-out could help them compete with AFC leaders Chiefs, Bengals, and Bills.
