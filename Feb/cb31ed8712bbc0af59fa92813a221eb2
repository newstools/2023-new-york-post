As long as humanity has existed, so has the urge to blend. Liquifying your breakfast is a primal urge, and it’s often easier to eat at 8:00AM, especially if you’re on-the-go. But if you were stuck living 300 years ago, or even 75, there weren’t many avenues for you. Luckily, as history marched forward, so too did blending technology. There may be some things you’re unhappy with in the world right now, but you’d be lying if you ever said we aren’t currently living in a golden age of blenders. Whether you’re looking to step up your morning protein shake game, or you’re planning an elaborate blended meal for Valentine’s Day (note: we do not advise this), Amazon has you covered, with this great deal on the Nurtri Ninja BL641 Countertop Blender. At 36% off, and with available Prime shipping, you could own your very own Ninja Blender two days sooner, and $90 less, than you can find it anywhere else. The Nutri Ninja BL642 comes with built-in Auto IQ technology, designed to find the perfect blend everytime, and take the guesswork out of blending. Mix your smoothie in the powerful 72oz blender, and distribute it into your small, regular, and jumbo serving cups to take on the go, wherever you like to drink your smoothie. This deal won’t be around for long, so we suggest you act fast. Blending may be forever, but Ninjas, historically, are fleeting. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
