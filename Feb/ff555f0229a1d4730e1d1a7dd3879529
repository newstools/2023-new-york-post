Things appear to feel a little bit different for Tom Brady watching Super Bowl 2023. The seven-time Super Bowl champion will be tuning in to watch the big game between the Eagles and Chiefs in Arizona on Sunday for the first time as an official retiree. Brady, 45, announced he was done with the game for good this time on Feb. 1, and no longer has a chance to add a ring to his record collection. Just before kickoff, Brady tweeted a gif of Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby from the movie “Talladega Nights” motioning and saying, “I’m not sure what to do with my hands.” After that, Brady did take a moment to send well wishes to Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes – who many believe has the best chance to challenge the former Patriots and Buccaneers star’s seven rings. “Two of the best tonight in Pat and Jalen,” wrote Brady, who last won a Super Bowl two years ago with Tampa Bay. “Good luck to KC and Philly, can’t wait to watch.” One thing Brady could do during the broadcast is to listen closely to the Fox team of Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen. The five-time Super Bowl MVP has a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox to join their broadcast team. Brady recently said that won’t happen until 2024 at the earliest, when Fox once again has the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl. That would likely mean Olsen would be out if he remains with Fox. Brady had the first losing campaign of his career at 8-9 with the Buccaneers this past season, despite the team winning the NFC South and losing in the opening round of the playoffs to the Dallas Cowboys. He threw for 4,694 yards, 25 touchdowns to nine interceptions this past season. Now Brady will have to get used to watching NFL games either from his couch or maybe, eventually, a Fox booth.
