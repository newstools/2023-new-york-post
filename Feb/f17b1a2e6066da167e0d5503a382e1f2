Brandon Marshall likely won’t let Patrick Mahomes live this one down. When taking part in a media session on Wednesday ahead of Super Bowl 2023 between the Chiefs and Eagles, Kansas City’s superstar quarterback took a question from Marshall, a former NFL receiver, who offered up a Rihanna-centric question before the singer’s highly anticipated halftime show on Sunday. “Rihanna came out and said that you are the greatest quarterback ever, hearing that, how does that make you feel?” Marshall asked. A clearly elated Mahomes responded, “It makes me feel great, she’s going to crush it at halftime. I have family members that I think are more excited about the halftime show than they are about the game, and so, whatever Rihanna says is like the gospel, so, I’m glad she went with me for that honor.” Unfortunately for the 27-year-old quarterback, the remark from Rihanna never transpired. “She didn’t, she didn’t,” Marshall told Mahomes before erupting with laughter. “You’ve got me up here smiling and smirking,” the five-time Pro Bowler said of Marshall. The “I AM ATHLETE” podcaster, 38, then turned the conversation to Mahomes’ legacy, asking the quarterback what “he’s chasing” ahead of his third Super Bowl appearance. “I don’t want to have any regrets when I step off this football field. I understand how lucky I am to be in this organization, I understand how lucky I am to play with guys that are going to be Hall of Famers,” he said. “When I get done with my career, I want to make sure that I know that I gave everything I have on that football field.” Mahomes began his career with the Chiefs in 2017, when the organization selected him 10th overall. He won his first Super Bowl in February 2020, when Kansas City defeated the San Francisco 49ers, 31-20.
