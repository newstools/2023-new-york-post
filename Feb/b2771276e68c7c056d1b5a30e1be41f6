James Dolan late Tuesday pushed out two of the top executives in charge of running his over-budget music venue slated to open in Las Vegas this fall, The Post has learned. The Knicks and Rangers owner plans to personally oversee the completion of the $2.2 billion MSG Sphere, a source told The Post. Dolan paid for a pricey Super Bowl ad during Sunday’s game promoting the new venue and its first act, U2. The high-tech MSG Sphere, which has been saddled cost overruns, is now slated to open in September. To get to the finish line, Dolan dumped MSG Sphere President Lucas Watson and MSG Sphere Senior Manager of Business Operations Jenna Wolfenson, according to an internal memo reviewed by The Post. Dolan said he is streamlining the organization so it can do a more efficient job with brand strategy and partnerships by leveraging its expertise across its family of companies, the memo said. He believed there were some weak links, a source close to the situation said. MSG declined comment. Dolan, who described The Sphere as the most technologically advanced entertainment venue in the world, announced in the memo he is adding Guy Barnett to head brand strategy and creative development. Dolan also plans to enlist David Hopkinson, the president of MSG Sports, which controls the Knicks and Rangers, to help guide the Sphere, according to the memo. The Sphere is part of Dolan’s Madison Square Garden Entertainment, which includes the Tao restaurants and venues like Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall. Watson was brought in last March to lead the strategy and execution of all business aspects of the arena. He previously had been general manager for self-driving company Cruise.
