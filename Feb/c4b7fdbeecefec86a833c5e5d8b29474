Megyn Kelly said she was “uncomfortable” watching first lady Jill Biden kiss second gentleman Doug Emhoff on the lips during Tuesday night’s State of the Union address — and called the smooch “gross.” “People should not be mouth-kissing ever if it’s not your husband or your spouse,” Kelly said during Wednesday’s broadcast of her SiriusXM podcast “The Megyn Kelly Show.” “Kamala’s husband and Joe Biden’s wife kissing on the mouth [at Tuesday night’s State of the Union] is, I’m sorry, secondhand uncomfortable…” The image of Biden and Emhoff smooching before President Biden’s speech went viral on Wednesday. The first lady planted the kiss on Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband as she made her way through the crowded chambers. Kelly said she can’t stomach the thought of another man who is not her spouse kissing her on her lips. “Not ever,” Kelly said Wednesday. “Don’t kiss me on my mouth. Don’t do it.” “In fact, don’t kiss me, and probably don’t hug me either.” Kelly said she would happily make do with “the wave or a pat.” “I’ll take that,” she said. “Definitely no mouth-kissing. Gross.” Kelly added: “I don’t know where your mouth has been, and I don’t want to know.” Even after the kiss, the first lady and Emhoff grabbed hands and shared a quick smile before swiftly embracing. No one in the immediate vicinity seemed fazed by the kiss between the president’s wife and vice president’s husband. The group continued to clap through the peculiar pecking order.
