It’s been a long time since Black Friday, and even if you scored a great deal on AirPods during the holiday season, there’s a lot of things that could’ve happened to them since then. Maybe you accidentally put them through the wash (we’re guilty of this). Maybe you went out one night with the full set (two AirPods Pro, one case), and woke up without your left AirPod. Or your right AirPod. You could’ve dropped them between the train and the platform, or gotten them mixed up with a friend’s (who proceeded to lose them), or maybe your case was sitting out in a rainstorm and your AirPods got struck by lightning. Hey, it could happen. The fact of the matter is: in life, things regularly happen that are beyond our control. Today, however, you can resist the long, all-encompassing arm of fate by capitalizing on Amazon’s huge sale on 2nd Generation AirPods Pro. At just $199, these Apple AirPods Pros are at their lowest price since Black Friday. We’re not sure how long this deal will be around for, so we’d recommend you act fast, and secure the best deal we’ve seen on these top-of-the-line wireless earbuds that we’ve seen all year. Save 20%, and experience Apple’s best audio quality yet with the 2nd Generation Apple AirPods Pro. Shut the world out with AirPods Pro’s noise-cancelling feature, or let some of it in, with Adaptive Transparency mode. With more features, customization, and improved audio-quality, these new generation AirPods are a steal at any price, but especially at $199.
