If you think global recognition gets to everyone’s heads, think again. Actor James Martin casually resumed his day job at Starbucks despite starring in an Oscar-nominated film titled “An Irish Goodbye.” The Northern Irish star’s name has crept up in more and more conversations among the Hollywood elite as his most recent on-screen venture scooped up an Oscar nod for “Best Short Film” on Jan. 24. Despite the fact that his project could potentially pick up a gong at next month’s Academy Awards, Martin thrust himself right back into work serving up coffees with a smile in his city of Belfast. “It’s nice,” the 30-year-old actor told the Daily Mail of his job at the coffee company. The actor, who lives with Down syndrome, also worked as a chef in the nearby Italian restaurant Scalini’s. “I can make garlic bread, meatballs, salads, and mussels, chips, and stuff like that,” he told the outlet. And when quizzed on whether his condition affects his onscreen abilities, Martin was quick to point out that “anybody can act.” “It doesn’t matter if you have Down syndrome,” Martin added. “I always say to people never judge a book by its cover.” Martin’s short film “An Irish Goodbye” also stars “Game of Thrones” actress Michelle Fairley. Set in rural Northern Ireland, the film follows a pair of estranged brothers who reunite following their mother’s sudden death, according to IMDB. The film is up against “The Red Suitcase,” “Night Ride,” “Ivalu,” and “Night Ride” in the “Best Short Film” category. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony takes place on March 13.
