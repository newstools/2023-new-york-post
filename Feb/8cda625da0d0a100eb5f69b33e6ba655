This doctor has lost his patience with the US healthcare system. One doctor has gone viral on TikTok after revealing the ugly truth that most health insurance companies allegedly want you to “die as quickly as possible.” The TikTok was posted Thursday and had racked up nearly one million views. “Healthcare companies don’t care about you,” said Dr. Glaucomflecken grimly. “They don’t care.” Glaucomflecken lists off several insurance companies including United Healthcare, Aetna, Cigna and Blue cross as the main guilty ones. “They want to extract as much money as possible from your healthy body,” continued the doctor. “Then when you’re no longer healthy, they want you to die as quickly as possible, to make room for other money-producing bodies so…have a great day.” Dr. Glaucomflecken’s comments come as health insurance companies raked in a massive profit during the COVID-19 pandemic which cause policy prices to soar drastically. In addition, Federal law requires hospitals and insurance companies to provide patients with the details of how much they are being charged. “Insurers want to make sure they are negotiating the best deals they can for their members, to make sure their products have competitive premiums, said chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans Matt Eyles to the New York Times. The Post reached out to Dr. Glaucomflecken for comment. Several of the doc’s commenters agreed with him. “I work in oncology. you 100% correct,” said one user. “As someone who works in health insurance verification—yes,” said another. “The longer I’m in medicine the more apparent this truth is,” a third person said.
