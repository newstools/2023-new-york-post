Looks like Liam Neeson will not be returning as a guest on “The View.” The Irish actor, 70, described his appearance on the ABC talk show last week as “embarrassing,” telling Rolling Stone the entire segment left him feeling “uncomfortable.” During his appearance on the show, co-host Joy Behar couldn’t help but air out her longtime crush on the “Taken” actor. In fact, the segment included a montage of clips that showed Behar making bizarre on-air comments such as, “I would just like to have my ashes sprinkled over Liam Neeson.” As the actor promoted his new film “Marlowe” — which marks his 100th film — one of the panelists on the show remarked, “Joy wants to get taken by you.” “I was in the dressing room drinking a cup of tea, turned the TV up, and I thought, oh, this will be great,” Neeson told the magazine. “They’re talking about gun violence in America, and I agree that it’s an American problem. I go onstage and join the ladies during the break, and I was congratulating them on this discussion.” “And then our segment starts, and it’s just all this BS with Joy and Liam Neeson and having a crush, and I’ve known Whoopi for years and Joy a little bit, but I just wasn’t impressed,” he went on, adding, “I’m uncomfortable in those situations, you know?” The actor said he later had a “good, intelligent conversation” with co-host Sunny Hostin following the on-air segment. “But then the segment’s all about this thirteen, fourteen-year-old crush. It’s just a bit embarrassing,” he added. The actor has had somewhat of an outspoken streak in recent weeks, most notably when he sensationally called UFC star Conor McGregor a “little leprechaun.” “That little leprechaun Conor McGregor, he gives Ireland a bad name,” Neeson told Men’s Health earlier this month. “I know he’s fit, and I admire him for that. But I can’t take it.” Neeson also said he “can’t stand” the UFC as he likened it to a “bar fight.”
