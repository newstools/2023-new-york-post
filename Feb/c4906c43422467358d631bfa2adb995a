Wrong administration. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre mistakenly referred to President Biden as “President Obama” off the top of her Thursday briefing. Jean-Pierre’s slip came as she announced that the president had nominated former MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank. “So today, as you all saw just an hour or so ago, President Obama announced that — um, pardon me, President Biden!” Kean-Pierre quickly corrected herself amid gasps and laughter from the White House press corps. “Whoa! Ahem, that is news,” she said. “I know, I know. We’re going back, not forwards. We got to go forward.” Jean-Pierre, who was named to replace Jen Psaki as press secretary in May 2022, is a longtime adviser to Biden dating back to his time as Obama’s vice president. Biden, 80, who is also famously known for flubs, has repeatedly called Vice President Kamala Harris the president, including as recently as last month. The president was making remarks on immigration at the White House in January when he singled out Harris. “President Harris led this effort — led this effort to make things better in the countries from which they are leaving,” Biden said. The commander-in-chief made similar blunders in October, calling Harris a “great president,” and last January, when he referred to his second-in-command as “President Harris.” The flubs date back to December 2020, shortly after the Biden-Harris ticket won the presidential election when Biden called his running mate “President-elect Harris.”
