Smooch of the Union. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff greeted each other with a kiss on the lips before the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday. Footage captured Biden shaking hands as she made her way through the crowded chambers toward Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband. The two grabbed hands and shared a quick smile before swiftly embracing in what appeared to be a well-rehearsed kiss, video shows. The pair continued to hold hands in the moments after the cozy display as Biden positioned herself on the other side of Emhoff. No one in the immediate vicinity seemed fazed by the kiss between the President’s wife and Vice President’s husband. The group continued to clap through the peculiar pecking.
