Two NYPD patrol cars were found scrawled with graffiti in Lower Manhattan over the weekend, cops said Monday. The police vehicles were parked on Varick Street between Ericson Place and North Moore Street when they were discovered with the words “Jesus is King” written on the back of them in black ink around 6:39 p.m. Sunday. Police said they have video of a female vandal in a yellow baseball cap fleeing afterward.
