One sibling has been left scratching their head at their younger brother’s Year 5 math exam. The question, shared to Reddit, asks students to figure out how many pages are in a book. “Klein read 30 pages of a book on Monday and one eighth of the book on Tuesday,” the question read. “He completed the remaining quarter of the book on Wednesday. How many pages are there in the book?”’ Some social media users were immediately stumped by the question. One person commented: “And now we can all see why Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? worked as a game show.” “Today I learned I would fail fifth grade math,” another said on the thread. One passionate person said: “I always think to my self; ‘Ugh. People should really be tested with basic skills before they’re allowed to go out into society’. “And then I see this and realize I shouldn’t go out into society LOL!” Not everyone agreed the question was difficult. “Not to be rude, but what is interesting about this,” one said. “It looks just like any other math problem that I’ve done in 5th grade.” Someone with a PhD in engineering, with a focus on applied mathematics, said it wasn’t difficult to work out but it came with the assumption that Klein started the book on Monday. Once you have that, you divide 30 pages by five to see how much one eighth is worth, with the answer being six. Math lovers then just do the simple multiplication of eight times six, with the answer being 48, and the equation is solved.
