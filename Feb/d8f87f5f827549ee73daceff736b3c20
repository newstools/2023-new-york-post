Even Catwoman couldn’t land on her feet. Halle Berry took a hard tumble as she went onstage to present the 2023 Soaring Spirit Award for the Looking Beyond LA Luncheon at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles on Feb. 8. “If I see this on the internet, Van’s coming for you,” Berry said pointing towards her boyfriend Van Hunt. The “Die Another Day” star laughed off the embarrassing moment on her Instagram account. “Sometime you bust your a—,” Berry said. “What happened was…” “My dear friend @shillahekmatpiano invited me to speak at her charity event celebrating a wonderful organization called @lookingbeyondla that raises money for children with special needs… then that happened!!! I face-planted,” the rest of the post said. In the video, the “Bruised” director walked onto the stage when her foot didn’t quite make it over the step and she ends up falling hard, face first onto the carpet stage. “Yep, that’s me you’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation,” a voiceover says in the Instagram video. A compilation of different angles of the fall plays, all the while Boney M.’s “Rasputin” serves as the video’s soundtrack. Berry, covering her face while laughing, finally got herself to the podium after the luncheon co-chairs Shilla Hekmat and Yas Baravarian helped her back to her feet. Finally composed, Berry presented the Spirit Award to honoree Jacob Smith, a 16-year-old visually impaired skier from North Dakota. Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumor eight years ago, which left him with severe vision problems. Looking Beyond is a nonprofit dedicated to promoting awareness and enriching the lives of children and young adults with special needs. Berry is in two upcoming Netflix projects, the sci-fi movie “The Mothership” and the spy-thriller “Our Man from Jersey,” starring alongside Mark Wahlberg.
