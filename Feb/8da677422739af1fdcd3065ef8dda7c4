Say goodbye to your crappy ex this Valentine’s Day. Feb. 14 is not full of roses and love for everyone — some people are happily single and are fine with ignoring the holiday. Others might be recently single or experiencing heartbreak, and are reminded of the raw memories thanks to the day that’s full of romantic cliches, pink and red color schemes, roses and candy hearts. Toilet paper company Who Gives a Crap wants to help people forget their exes and find a way to enjoy Valentine’s Day. The company is giving people the opportunity to flush their ex down the toilet. You read that right — all your paper-based memories can be upcycled into toilet paper that can wipe away the pain. Love letters, cards and notes from your ex can all be made into toilet paper. It helps the company “repurpose something that would otherwise sit gathering dust in old cupboards and drawers,” while you get to “eradicate any memory [that your ex] ever happened out of existence.” People eager to send their ex down the drain will have to wait until Feb. 8 to send in all their unwanted memories to Who Gives a Crap. The company will provide more details on how to do this on its website, which will go live on the same day. The cost of the new product hasn’t been announced yet, but the company currently sells boxes of 48 rolls of toilet paper for $66. Another way to get a cathartic feeling after the end of a relationship is to name a cockroach after an ex and feed it to an animal — a service the San Antonio Zoo in Texas is more than happy to provide. The zoo’s Cry Me a Cockroach fund-raiser allows you to name a cockroach, rodent or veggie after the person who you wish to forget and feed the effigy to an animal.
