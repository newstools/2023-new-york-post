Customers came for coffee, but left with some piping hot tea instead. Patrons at a Pret a Manger franchise in London got more than they bargained for when a fight over a skinny latte turned physical. Two grown men were seen arguing over the low-fat beverage at the counter of the coffee shop before taking their disagreement outside. The incident was captured by one eyewitness who uploaded the altercation to TikTok, where it quickly went viral, clocking up more than 1.9 million views. The clip now appears to have been deleted but the fight allegedly began after the pair “argued over who the ready skinny latte was for.” Once outdoors, one of the men seemingly agreed to a truce, walking off on his own. However, the other subsequently hurled a drink in his direction prompting him to turn around and engage in a scuffle. Despite the physical aspect of the incident, some viewers were humored by the viral TikTok clip, according to the Daily Mail. “Respectfully at least they threw it [the drink] outside,'” one wrote. “The staff don’t need to worry about the mess.” Another claimed that it appeared it was the skinny latte that was hurled during the squabble, meaning both of the men ended up without the drink. “Now nobody has a skinny latte,” the viewer opined. However, another chimed in, stating: “The fight gave them a better morning boost than the coffee itself.” The skinny latter lovers aren’t the only people to be caught on camera fighting over foamy drinks in recent months. In August last year, a grown man was seen attacking a teenager outside a coffee shop in Valencia, California. Cops were called to the scene after the teen was pinned to the ground by the irate adult.
