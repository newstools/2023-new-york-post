A 41-year-old woman was shot in the head in front of her children during a dispute with a neighbor in a public housing building in Harlem Wednesday, cops said. Jemina Garay was rushed to Harlem Hospital in critical condition after she was shot just before 8:30 a.m. in the 6th floor hallway of NYCHA’s Lincoln Houses on East 135th Street, police said. Her husband, Eric Garay, 42, identified the victim during a brief phone call with The Post. “Nobody’s thinking about the fact that my children are going to see this,” he said, while sobbing. “And they’re going to have to relive this over and over again,” “Her name was J-E-M-I-N-A G-A-R-A-Y and she was the f–king best,” he added of his wife. “That’s all I’m giving everybody. She was the f–king best.” She was rushed to Harlem Hospital in critical condition. The shooter was described as wearing a red jacket with black writing on it. He fled on foot toward Harlem River Drive, cops said. The NYPD’s Aviation Unit had helicopters in the air searching for him.
