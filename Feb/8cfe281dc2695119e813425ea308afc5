The biggest day for football may be behind us, but it’s not too early to start planning for next year or your other favorite sports. Good drinks are a major part of any good tailgate, and now you can transform cans into cups with the New Draft Top® 3.0. This handheld gadget puts a new spin on the name can opener. Pop the top off almost any aluminum drink for quick beverage customization and reusable cups. Usually, one of these can openers would cost $32, but you can get one for $19.99. Whether you like a lime with your beer, want to save money on party supplies, or are trying to cut down on your post-party trash, the New Draft Top® could help you out. Just fit the Draft Top over your can and give it a few good twists. The four rotational blades split and fold the lid as it turns. The rim you’re left with should be totally smooth and feel just like a regular cup. Plus, aluminum is a lot more recyclable than plastic or glass. Some manufacturers even call it infinitely recyclable. Cleanup might also be easier when you can just throw all the cups into the recycling bin. Want to add some spice to your beverage? Pop the top. That’s what one verified buyer did: “Great product, very easy to use! I enjoy opening a fresh sparkling water and just adding my favorite adult beverage right into the can.” Use your Draft Top on almost any eight and 16-ounce aluminum beverage cans. It even works with some 19-ounce cans. The football off-season might be easier to get through if you’re already stocking up for your next tailgate.
