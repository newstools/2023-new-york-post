A simple truth: You can’t spell “high-quality, wireless audio experience” without AirPods. You could try, but if you do you’ll end up with something basically illegible. And we think that illustrates our point nicely enough. No AirPods: no high quality wireless audio experience, at least not in any true sense. It’s as simple as that. Needless to say, since the advent of Apple AirPods, they’ve flown off the shelves every time they’re on sale (and even when they’re not). Ready to detangle your commute? How about your workout, or dishwashing, or laundry-doing, or just simple hanging-around? For under $100 on Amazon this week, take the AirPods plunge, if you haven’t already, with the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation), now 38% off.  Or, if you’re interested in taking it up a notch, you can grab these 1st Generation Apple AirPods Pro for 22% off, while supplies last. Whether you have a pair and want to upgrade, you lost one of your Pods down the grate on the subway, or you’ve never dabbled and you’re looking to splurge, there’s never been a better time to invest in AirPods. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. These sturdy, reliable 2nd Generation standard AirPods are marked down to under $100 this week. Looking to see if AirPods are right for you?
