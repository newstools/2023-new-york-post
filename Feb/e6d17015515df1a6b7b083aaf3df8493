UNLV defensive lineman Ryan Keeler died in Las Vegas on Monday, the university said in a statement. He was 20 years old. “We are devastated to have lost a member of our Rebel family,” first-year UNLV football head coach Barry Odom said in a statement. “While I had the honor of knowing Ryan for only a couple of months, he already stood out to our coaching staff as an incredible person, student and teammate. Our condolences and prayers go out to Ryan’s family as we grieve along with them over this tremendous loss.” A cause of death was not announced. Keeler had just completed his redshirt freshman season and played in seven games, recording eight tackles. The Chicago native transferred to UNLV from Rutgers University last season, and was majoring in pre-business. Keeler was also an Academic All-Mountain West honoree and held a 3.80 GPA. “Long Live Ryan Keeler gone way too soon I’m lost for words right now love you forever brother,” fellow UNLV defensive lineman Adam Plant Jr. wrote on Twitter with a black heart and dove emoji. Keeler played high school football at Nazareth Academy in Illinois, and was a highly recruited player with dozens of scholarship offers. “We love you, Ryan,” Rutgers football said on Twitter. “There are no words. Our hearts are heavy. God bless the Keeler family. We love you Ryan,” the Nazareth Academy football wrote on Twitter. “The UNLV family is in mourning today over the sudden loss of one of our own,” UNLV athletics director Erick Harper said. “Our hearts go out to all of Ryan’s family and friends along with his Rebel teammates.” UNLV president Keith E. Whitfield said in a statement: “Words are hard to come by this evening as we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of UNLV student-athlete Ryan Keeler. My sincere condolences are with Ryan’s family, friends, loved ones, and teammates during this very difficult time.”
