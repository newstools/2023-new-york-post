An 8-year-old boy missing from Washington for over half a year was safely located in Missouri earlier this month, officials said. Breadson John, of Vancouver, was found in Jasper, Missouri, on Feb. 17, the FBI’s Seattle division confirmed on Tuesday. Breadson, who also goes by the nickname Brxsan, was first listed as missing on June 17, 2022, when Vancouver police were unable to locate the boy during a welfare check after family members became concerned. At the time of his disappearance, authorities said Breadson might have traveled to Hawaii, where he was born — otherwise Arizona or the Pacific island nation of the Federated States of Micronesia. Investigators learned that the boy was possibly in Missouri in August, and subsequently recovered him with the help of local police, according to KGW8. As of Wednesday, authorities had not released more details about who had taken Breadson or how long he had been away from home. Breadson is in the custody of the Missouri Department of Social Services, and will be escorted back to his home state by Washington Child Protective Services, KGW8 reported. “Breadson’s recovery would not have been possible without the combined efforts of the Vancouver Police Department, FBI Kansas City, and the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office,” Richard A. Collodi, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Seattle field office, told the outlet. “We are relieved at this outcome and how quickly we were able to resolve it.”
