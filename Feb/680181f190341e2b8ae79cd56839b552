Four people were injured when a decorative helicopter figurine came crashing down into a pool full of children inside New Jersey’s American Dream mall Sunday. One person was rushed to the hospital and three others were treated on the scene after the large display came crashing down from the ceiling of the DreamWorks Water Park inside the East Rutherford mall around 3 p.m., officials said. The water park was evacuated and police are investigating the terrifying incident. None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries. Authorities have not released the ages of the injured, but the park-goers said the helicopter was hung from a wire above a kiddy pool area. The section of the water park where the display fell is called “The Penguins Frozen Fun Zone” and is designed for toddlers, according to the American Dream website. Visitors enjoying the water park said they heard a crash and then screams from both parents and kids as people began panicking. “A large helicopter display fell on to a kiddy pool and slide area! Chaos soon after,” Angel Sanchez tweeted alongside photos of the downed copter. “The sound was scary then the screaming from parents and kids.” Mall officials closed the park for the rest of the day and said it would remain closed Monday. “The safety of our guests is our highest priority. We will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident to ensure the park meets all safety regulations as required,” American Dream officials said in a statement to NJ.com. With Post wires.
