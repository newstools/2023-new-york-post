It was an ant invasion. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” crawled its way to the top of the box office on its opening night Friday. The Marvel creation, which The Post called “a pile of dirt,” took home a staggering $63.5 million, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. It scored as the third-highest opening day in February after “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” as per Deadline. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” the final installment of the Channing Tatum stripper series, undressed its way to second place, with a $1.66 million-dollar take. Released on Feb. 9, the comedy-drama is “so long and repetitive that you would gladly tip the guys to stop and put some pants on,” said The Post. “Avatar: The Way of Water” remained in third, earning close to $1.36 million. Its director, James Cameron has already shot the third ‘Avatar” film and started on the fourth. In an interview with Time, he said he plans to spend at least eight more years on the series … if he ends it with a fifth film. “But there will come a point where I’ll have to pass the baton, just physiologically,” he told the outlet. “Mortality is going to come knocking on the door at some point.” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,’ which was in fifth place last Friday, moved up to fourth, taking home $1.21 million. M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Knock at the Cabin,” which was in fourth last week, moved down to fifth, with just over $1 million in sales.
