Several cop cars just had their tires slashed in Forest Hills — only the latest in about 20 attacks on police vehicles in the city since the beginning of the year, law-enforcement sources said Friday. At least one vandal slashed tires on up to seven NYPD cars near the 112 precinct station house in Queens, sources said. The precinct covers the Forest Hills and Rego Park neighborhoods.No arrests were immediately reported. Earlier this week, a vandal scrawled graffiti on two cop cars in Lower Manhattan, on Varick Street between Ericson Place and N. Moore Street, authorities said. The female vandal wrote “Jesus is King” on the cruisers with a black marker. No arrests have been made in that case, authorities said. The other incidents of police car vandalism also occurred near precinct station houses, where NYPD cars are parked while not in use, sources said.
