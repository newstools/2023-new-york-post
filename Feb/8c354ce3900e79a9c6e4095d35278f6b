One of the best parts about owning a phone is being able to use it. For that you need a charger, and when you’re on the go, a portable charger, preferably one that’s on sale. If you phone isn’t charged, it’s basically useless, at least based on our findings. You aren’t able to call or text. You aren’t able to use your maps to find where your friends are, or even your way back home. Ditto for music, games, notes, and voice recordings. It can be a real shock to the system for phone users. The screen goes black and there’s not much to do with it, besides maybe play catch, but we wouldn’t recommend that. What we do recommend? This deal on an Anker 621 Magnetic Wireless Portable Charger, marked down $25 this week on Amazon. Consider for a moment, the charger you have at home: is it portable? Is it magnetic?
