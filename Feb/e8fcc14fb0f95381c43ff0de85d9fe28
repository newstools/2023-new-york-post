Oreo lovers slam-dunked the maker of the cheap sweet treat for peddling a limited-edition, NBA-themed version of the cookie for $40 per box. The promotion by Oreo-maker Mondelez offers packs of 12 NBA-themed cookies that feature the team logos and colors of all 30 franchises. It is timed to coincide with next week’s NBA All-Star weekend in Salt Lake City. But fans were in for some sticker shock when they noticed the price of these Oreo packs are $39.95 — not including delivery. A regular box of Oreos at the supermarket costs around $4. “For 40 dollars do the cookies reappear after I eat them,” one Twitter user quipped. Many others on social media said Mondelez can go double-stuff itself. “Yes of course I want these NBA logo Oreos. But at $40 a pack? 0% chance,” wrote one Twitter user. Another commented: “Those are some pricey cookies, especially since they’re like $4/bag at Safeway.” Another Twitter user replied: “You keep the box.” He added a hysterically laughing emoji. The Post has sought comment from Oreo’s parent company, Mondelez International, and the NBA. In March 2021, the NBA and Mondelez signed a multi-year marketing and licensing agreement that included the initial launch of limited edition “NBA Dynasty” Oreo packs, featuring the logos of some franchises on the cookies. Oreo recently unveiled its OREOiD technology where customers can customize their own cookies to include messages and even photos of themselves. The new, colorful designs feature the team logos in the white, creamy middle between the chocolate covers. Mondelez is the maker of snack treats including Chips Ahoy!, Nutter Butter, Sour Patch Kids, and Ritz Crackers. The Chicago-based confectionary conglomerate announced last year that it would hike prices of its products by 7%.
