Joy Behar revealed she was “happy” to be fired from “The View” in 2013 — because she lost all her friends on the show. The hosts of the daytime talk show were discussing workplace friendships on Wednesday when show guest Behar, 80, got emotional about the time she was ousted from the show, saying she was glad because her friends had already left. “I always have friends where I work, and if I don’t have friends at the job, I will not keep the job,” Behar said. “So, when I was fired last time from this show, people say to me, ‘Were you okay with that?’ and my answer is, I was happy, because all my friends had left already. So, there was no reason to stay anymore. I mean it.” Behar was one of the original “View” co-hosts who helped launch the show with the late Barbara Walters in 1997. But not everyone on the panel was so thrilled with Behar’s appreciation for leaving. Whoopi Goldberg was already a permanent member of “The View” panel by the time Behar left, and she shed a fake tear over the revelation. “Really? All your friends left?” Goldberg, 67, questioned. She then faked a cry with a quivering lip, joking, “It’s OK, I’m cool.” “You had just come on, and my backstage friends had left. And I don’t like to work when I don’t have friends,” Behar quickly clarified. Goldberg said that she was only “teasing” and that they had “been friends for a long time.” The “Sister Act” star joined the view in 2007 and sat on the panel with Behar long before her exit in August 2013. Behar returned to the show in 2015 while also fronting two solo talk shows: “The Joy Behar Show” and “Joy Behar: Say Anything!” But Behar promised she’s not going anywhere this time, likening herself to Joe Biden. “Joe Biden and I are the same age. Would you say I could not do my job for the next four years? Of course I can,” Behar said. “And the haters can go stick their heads in something, because I’m not moving out of this seat.”
