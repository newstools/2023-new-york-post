He’s getting another shot. An Irish pub has officially lifted its quarter-century ban on Oscar-nominated actor Colin Farrell — just in time for next month’s awards show. He was barred from MacCarthy’s Bar in Cork in 1997 for his “outrageous” antics when he was just entering his 20s. Adrienne MacCarthy revealed she threw the actor, now 46, out of the pub, saying she had “grown sick” of his behavior over three months. “He was new out of acting school,” she told Jam Press, recalling his 12-week stint in Cork. “He had wild times, and at 19, we’re all wild and misbehave.” “He was outrageous, so I had enough and said, ‘That’s it, you’re out!'” she added. The Post reached out to a Farrell rep for comment. Farrell reportedly returned to the establishment when he was filming the 2009 movie “Ondine” and ran into MacCarthy, who was convinced to reconsider the ban. “He wanted to see if the bar was the same, and if the pugs are still here,” she said. “Colin said he couldn’t quite remember being barred, but we had a laugh about it.” In fact, the pair became pals — MacCarthy said they “understand each other now.” “He’s just normal and down-to-earth,” she gushed of the actor, who was a “wild child” in his heyday. “Nowadays he’s more interested in pilates, yoga and healthy living.” “We’re proud of him no matter what,” she added. Farrell is up for an Academy Award, nominated for Best Actor for his role in “The Banshees of Inisherin.” In fact, it’s his first Oscar nomination — and the golden statue would join his two Golden Globes. His role in the film also earned him a Desert Palm Achievement Award. Last year, the acclaimed star appeared in “Thirteen Lives” and “The Batman,” in the latter film playing the role of the villain, which he will reprise in the upcoming HBO Max series “The Penguin.” The project begins production this month, but a premiere date has not been announced.
