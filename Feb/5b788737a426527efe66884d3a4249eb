Some are saying it’s bean done better. A Tribeca sculpture by famed artist Anish Kapoor that resembles the iconic “Bean” in Chicago was lampooned by observers in the Second City. The Big Apple’s version is crammed underneath a luxury building’s canopy, unlike its Chicago sibling. Officially named “Cloud Gate,” the free-standing sculpture in Millennium Park has become an iconic symbol of Illinois’ largest city, the Chicago Tribune noted. “It needs to be out in the open. And to have it stuffed underneath a building in New York, it’s a little strange,” Chicago Sun-Times architecture critic Lee Bey told WBBM. “Interesting approach, but I couldn’t help coming away thinking ours is still better.” The New York version of the artwork is wedged beneath 56 Leonard Street, known locally as “the Jenga Building,” since its structure is formed like the block game — where Kapoor purchased a $13.5 million apartment in 2016. The as-yet-unnamed sculpture at the corner of Church Street was officially unveiled Friday. Originally commissioned in 2008, the project was put on hold due to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The tower was built in 2017, and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. For years, the sculpture stood partially finished and bound by scaffolding, and as a result, was given the moniker “Half Bean.” The large round and reflective creation, which stands 19-feet tall at its highest point, cost between $8 and $10 million.
