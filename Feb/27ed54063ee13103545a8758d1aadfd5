Brittany Matthews is giving fans a behind-the-scenes look at her game-day prep. In the hours leading up to Super Bowl 2023 on Sunday, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted a series of videos on her Instagram, where she showed off her glamorous look for the big game. “I went with this outfit for game day, cute and simple, and comfy,” the 27-year-old Matthews said of her fiery red ensemble. Although Matthews had most of her outfit ready, she had a slight hiccup with her footwear. “My shoes are actually still en route to me because I’m a horrible last-minute person,” she added. Fortunately for Matthews, her white heels arrived right on time. “See y’all soon,” the KC Current co-owner captioned a separate post of the finished look, which also included hair and makeup styling by Laurabeth Cabott and Alexis Oakley, respectively. Matthews is gearing up for her third Super Bowl experience with Mahomes, her high-school sweetheart. The mother of two supported the league’s newly crowned MVP at Super Bowl 2020, when the Chiefs defeated the 49ers, and the year after, when Kansas City fell to Tampa Bay. Leading up to Super Bowl 2023, Matthews posted a heartfelt tribute to Mahomes, 27, on Instagram. “Riding with you always,” she gushed in January. It’s been a wild 12 months for Matthews and Mahomes, who tied the knot in Hawaii in March 2022. The couple expanded their family this past November with the birth of their second child, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III. Baby Bronze joins big sister Sterling Skye, who will celebrate her second birthday later this month. Super Bowl 2023 between the Chiefs and Eagles kicks off at 6:30 p.m. from State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
