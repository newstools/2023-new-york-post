A woman who had gone away for five days only to find a bizarre black “dust” over her shower has been left stumped at the issue. The mother, from New South Wales, Australia took to a popular Facebook group after stumbling upon the mess after a break. Photos showed black “dust” sat on the mantle of the tiles of the shower as well as the rim of the bathtub. She said she had noticed a few spots before she had left for her trip, but surface sprayed it. But that didn’t work, so she turned to the online community for help. Many speculated that it could have been an ant infestation. Charlotte Bosanquet, the founder of Care Cleaning Services Sydney, told news.com.au that it did look like the speculation about the pest infestation was correct. “I definitely think by the sounds of it it’s some sort of infestation,” she said after reviewing the images. “Alternatively it may be black mold which can be common in wet environments. “Either way, I would highly recommend staying on the safe side and hiring pest control and a professional cleaning service to ensure that this is prevented in the future!” Care Cleaning Services Sydney was established less than a year ago after Charlotte lost her commercial cleaning job due to being stranded in Fiji for a month because of Covid-19 border closures, but has quickly developed into a well-known brand. Back on the social media post, the woman posted an update after getting the advice of social media users. “My husband investigated further – and he found a tiny hole in the bottom corner of the architrave around the window,” she said, according to Daily Mail Australia. “He watched some tiny black ants come in and out – we have bought some Ant Rid bait strips from the supermarket and have placed them near the tiny hole! Fingers crossed it works!”
