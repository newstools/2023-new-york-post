Tom Brady is really making the most of his newfound time off. Taking to his Instagram Stories on Monday, less than a week after announcing his NFL retirement, the seven-time Super Bowl champion stripped down to his briefs following a previous wager. “Deals a deal @bradybrand,” Brady captioned the post, calling out his men’s apparel line. “Did I do it right? @edelman11 @gronk,” the 45-year-old asked his former teammates turned pals, Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski. Back in June, Brady — who called it a career “for good” following 23 seasons in the league — said he’d recreate promotional photos from a Brady brand marketing campaign that highlighted the line’s underwear collection if a certain social media milestone was reached. “40k likes and I’ll recreate these photos,” Brady tweeted at the time. Although much has happened between now and then, the Twitter account for the Brady Brand kindly reminded the former Buccaneers and Patriots quarterback about his wager on Monday morning. “Hey @TomBrady we haven’t forgotten about this,” the message read. Brady’s social media posts have gotten extra attention in recent days following his retirement announcement, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, joining those celebrating the quarterback’s prolific career. “Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life,” the 42-year-old supermodel wrote to Brady on Instagram last Wednesday. The couple finalized their divorce in October after 13 years of marriage. They share son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10. Brady also co-parents son Jack, 15, with his ex, Bridget Moynahan.
