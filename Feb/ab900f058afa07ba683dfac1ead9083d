A day after demanding that the Nets trade him, Kyrie Irving will sit out Saturday night’s game against the Wizards in Brooklyn. The Nets said Irving is out due to right calf soreness. The news comes after the embattled All-Star requested that the team trade him by the Feb. 9 deadline, or he will leave in free agency this summer. Irving has been looking for a four-year, $198 million extension. ESPN reported that to this point no teams have expressed a willingness to make that kind of investment in the 30-year-old, who has been embroiled in multiple controversies for much of his career. The Lakers and Mavericks have reportedly expressed interest in trading for Irving before the deadline, though Dallas apparently has some concerns over how Irving’s personality would mesh alongside its own star, Luka Doncic. Lakers great Magic Johnson, meanwhile, said he’d “love” to see Irving in the purple and gold alongside LeBron James. The Heat and Suns are also among teams reportedly interested in Irving and there remains a bevy of options on how the Nets could proceed with their disgruntled guard.
