Are you a home chef? If so, what are you cooking dinner for yourself, and your loved ones in? If it’s not a cast iron, you’re missing out on an easy metaphor to charm and impress your bae as you chop, mince, and sauté. There are more days in the year to cook a romantic meal for two than just Valentine’s Day, you know. Try this one on for size: “Babe, now that I’m cooking in this cast iron, I’m actually reminded of my love for you.” “Hmm?” your bae wonders from the other side of the kitchen, glass of red wine in hand, intrigued. “Well,” you might continue, “like a cast iron, our love only gets better with age. With each passing meal, more oil seeps into the surface of the pan, making for an easier cook, and richer flavors. In much the same way, with each passing day, my love for you takes on new dimensions, hues, and depth, improving steadily over time as we spend our lives together.” That’s a freebie, on us. You can take it to the bank. And while you’re there, make sure to take out enough cash to nab this great deal on the Cast Iron Always Pan from Our Place, currently 25% off on Sizzle Sale.
