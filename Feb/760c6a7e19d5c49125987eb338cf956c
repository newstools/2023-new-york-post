An amorous couple have angered beachgoers by getting hot and heavy in the sand. A bizarre video shows the frisky couple canoodling on Henley Beach in Adelaide, Australia. They were eventually confronted by a local who was upset at their risque display taking place near children. When approached by the bystander, the man apologized. “Yeah, 100 percent sorry for doing that in front of kids,” the man on camera. Footage of the pair on top of each other as beachgoers walked by made its way to social media, with many slamming them for having no shame. “It’s actually disgusting that people find this funny. Kids were literally there,” one user commented. “Keep it for the bedroom…nobody wants to go to the beach to see that,” another said.
