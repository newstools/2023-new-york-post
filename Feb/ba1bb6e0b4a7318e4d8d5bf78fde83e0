Rumor has it Adele stormed out of the Grammys on Sunday night after Harry Styles scooped up Album of the Year. But now, new footage filmed by Lizzo has poured cold water on those hot claims. A video, posted to the 34-year-old “Good as Hell” crooner’s TikTok account on Tuesday, shows that Adele, 34, stayed the course throughout Style’s acceptance speech — and even cheered for the former One Direction heartthrob, 29, as he was announced as the winner. Both Adele and Lizzo were also nominated in the Album of the Year category, but there were widespread reports that the pair were peeved that fellow nominee Beyoncé, 41, didn’t nab the award for her record “Renaissance.” One pundit on Twitter even posted footage that appeared to show Adele walking out, with Lizzo laughing as the “Hello” singer stepped in front of her, seemingly leaving. “Adele leaving during Harry Styles’ little speech and Lizzo understanding why has me weak,” they wrote in a tweet that was viewed more than 1 million times. However, the very short video was misleading, with Adele reportedly moving a table out of the way as Harry spoke onstage. And while Adele is a noted Beyoncé super fan, she has also been friends with Styles for several years and was overjoyed for his big win. Lizzo’s TikTok video also shows her overjoyed at Style’s win, hugging him before he heads up onstage. One fan commented beneath the clip: “Insider’s view. I love how they’re all friends.” Another cooed: “This is so wholesome.” Meanwhile, further footage shared on Twitter also helped put to bed the wild walkout rumor. “Fans saying Adele walked out of Harry Styles speech, this part of the live broadcast shows that’s fake. Please,” the Twitter user wrote beneath a video showing the songstress smiling in the crowd while Styles spoke onstage.
