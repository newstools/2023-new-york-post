These grannies are shining bright like diamonds. A group of peppy seniors from a Kentucky assisted-living facility went viral this week with    a TikTok video recreating part of Rihanna’s performance at the Super Bowl halftime show – with some commenters even suggesting they out-performed the pop legend. Eleven ladies ages 80 to 92 appear in the 12-second video posted Thursday dressed in all white, and pop out of the screen by two’s to reveal 87-year-old Dora Martin dressed in all red, holding a microphone and lip-syncing lyrics from Rihanna’s “Rude Boy.” “I’m just a silly person, and I like to do what other people want me to do,” Martin told The Post about why she decided to participate in the video. Martin, 82-year-old Sue Evans and 86-year-old Pat — who declined to give her last name — said they were happily roped into making the video by two 20-something-year-old employees at Arcadia Senior Living. “It does keep us young,” Martin said. “They do a nice job at trying to change up the atmosphere here…by trying different things – and we enjoy falling for it,” Pat chimed in. The oldtimers — and their grandkids — were in disbelief when the video reached more than 15 million views and 2 million “likes” by Friday. “Maybe they’ll want us next year for the Super Bowl,” Evans said with a laugh.
