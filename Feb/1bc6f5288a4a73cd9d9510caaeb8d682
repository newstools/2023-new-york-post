San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy will not undergo right elbow surgery as planned on Wednesday due to continued swelling, multiple media outlets reported Tuesday night. The determination reportedly was made Tuesday at Arlington, Texas, where Texas Rangers team physician Keith Meister was due to perform the operation the next day. Purdy will meet again with Meister in early March to determine when the surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament will be done, per multiple media reports. Purdy previously said he planned to undergo the type of surgery that would get him back on the field the quickest, which would involve an InternalBrace ligament augmentation. That procedure reportedly would require a six-month recovery period, as opposed to a longer period for a hybrid operation including a partial elbow reconstruction. Six months from early March would be right at the start of the 2023 season, with the opening game scheduled for Sept. 7. Purdy, 23, made a stunning rise from being the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft to leading the 49ers into the NFC Championship Game. After 49ers quarterbacks Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo got injured in the regular season, Purdy took over and led the team to wins in each of the final five games. Purdy and the 49ers then defeated the Seattle Seahawks and the Dallas Cowboys in the playoffs before falling to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC title game when Purdy sustained the elbow injury. After fourth-stringer Josh Johnson went down with a concussion against Philadelphia, Purdy returned to action but was unable to throw the ball more than a few yards downfield. In the regular season, Purdy completed 67.1 percent of his passes for 1,374 yards with 13 scoring passes and four interceptions. In the postseason, he had a 65.1 percent completion rate while throwing for 569 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions.
