Substantial exposure to phthalates — chemicals found in hundreds of products, including soaps, shampoos and nail polishes — is linked to a higher incidence of Type 2 diabetes among white women, a new study found. “Our research found phthalates may contribute to a higher incidence of diabetes in women, especially white women, over a six-year period,” Dr. Sung Kyun Park, a University of Michigan epidemiologist, said in a statement Wednesday. White women exposed to high levels of some phthalates had a 30-63% greater chance of developing diabetes, while Black and Asian women fared much better, according to the study published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. Phthalates make plastic more durable — and they are used in personal care products, children’s toys, as well as packaging for food and beverages, and even in fast food meals. Phthalates are known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) because they mimic estrogen. Studies have shown they can negatively affect hormone balance, fertility and child development. For this research, scientists analyzed the urine of 1,308 women from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation over six years to see if phthalates contributed to a diabetes diagnosis. About 5% of the women developed the condition between 2000 and 2006. While white women exposed to high levels of chemicals had a 30-63% greater diabetes risk, phthalates weren’t linked to diabetes in Black or Asian women. “People are exposed to phthalates daily, increasing their risk of several metabolic diseases,” Park said. “It’s important that we address EDCs now as they are harmful to human health.” The scientists noted more research is needed on phthalates’ effect on metabolic diseases. A 2021 study estimated phthalates may have been associated with 91,000 to 107,000 premature deaths among American adults between 55 and 64 years old.
