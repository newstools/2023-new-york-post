The US military has shot down the Chinese spy balloon that has floated across North America for the past week — with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin slamming the device as an “unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.” Fox News video showed the deflated white balloon dropping down into the Atlantic Ocean, 10 miles below, shortly after the craft cleared the South Carolina coast near Myrtle Beach Saturday afternoon. “I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible without doing damage to anyone on the ground. They decided that the best time to do that was when it got over water,” President Biden told reporters as he stepped off Air Force One in Maryland, en route to Camp David, adding “They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it.” The massive spy balloon was believed to be the size of about three buses. “In accordance with the President’s direction, the Department of Defense developed options to take down the balloon safely over our territorial waters, while closely monitoring its path and intelligence collection activities,”  Austin said in a statement. Anticipation for a takedown of the spy balloon came Saturday afternoon as the Federal Aviation Administration closed the air space in the Carolinas and shut down three regional airports.  Operations at Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Wilmington were paused Saturday afternoon and the facilities were reopened after the spy balloon was destroyed. Earlier Saturday, President Biden had told reporters, “We’re gonna take care of it,” when asked about the spy balloon.
