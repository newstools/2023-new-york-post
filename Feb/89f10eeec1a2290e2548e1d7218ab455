Micah Parsons has a thing for feet. The Cowboys’ star linebacker admitted he had a foot fetish while speaking with CBS’ Bryant McFadden, who asked Parsons what the weirdest thing about him is. McFadden was taken aback by the no-filter answer. Parsons was featured on the segment, answering rapid-fire questions. After revealing Tampa Bay running back Leonard Fournette is the best trash talker in the NFL, his favorite sports movie is “Rudy,” and the most embarrassing song on his playlist is “Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira, Parsons let his guard down even more. Parsons is known to speak his peace when prompted and it showed on CBS on Friday. “I have a foot fetish,” he answered in less than a second. McFadden, a former NFL cornerback, quickly replied, “A foot fetish? You like toes?” “Yeah,” the two-time Pro Bowler said. “Okay,” McFadden concluded with a puzzling face. The Cowboys’ season ended in the divisional playoff round against the San Francisco 49ers on a bizarre final play. Parsons, who was drafted in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, concluded his sophomore season with 13.5 sacks, 42 solo tackles, and three forced fumbles.
