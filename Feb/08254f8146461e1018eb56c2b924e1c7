Jake Paul lost to an actual boxer. It was Tommy Fury who emerged victorious via split-decision, overcoming a dramatic eighth-round knockdown in the process. Two judges ruled in favor of Fury with scores of 76-73, and a third judge ruled 75-74 for Paul in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Paul is now 6-1 in his pro career. “In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.” The fight had a rematch clause if Fury won, which Paul said he’d exercise following the loss. So we’ll likely see these two do it again later this year. “I’ve already won every single way in life,” Paul said. “I made it farther than I ever thought I would, and beyond. This is a humbling experience. I’ll take it on the chin and come back.” In round one, Fury (8-0) confidently jabbed his way to some success, also landing a potentially round-stealing combination in the closing seconds. Paul, whose previous fights included MMA stars Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren, began finding a home for his signature overhand right in rounds two and three, and seemingly found his range as Fury abandoned his jab and reach advantage. Fury asserted himself in round four, responding with more combinations, putting forth his best round of the fight. The referee then became the show, questionably deducting one point each from Paul and Fury in rounds five and six, respectively. Ultimately, an incredibly close fight was not decided by a dramatic Paul knockdown in the final round with a thunderous jab that knocked Fury off balance. Fury boxed well to close the round, and won the fight on the judges’ cards. “All the way through these 2 1/2 years, I had a dream, I had a vision that I would win this fight,” Fury said. “No one believed me. Now I can stand up, and everyone can take note.” — with AP
