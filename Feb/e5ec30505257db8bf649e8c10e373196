Former President Donald Trump pardoned Kodak Black, born Dieuson Octave — and he’s now free to branch into commercial real estate. The rapper, 25, purchased a nearly 1-acre property in Pompano Beach, Florida, for $1.8 million, according to the Real Deal. Located at 1511-1547 Hammondville Road, the property makes up two single-story commercial buildings constructed in the 1950s — spanning nearly 3,800 square feet and 4,900 square feet. Apex Capital Realty’s Danilo Aquino, who represented the seller in the deal, told the outlet the singer is considering renovating one building and tearing down the other to build a new retail building. Meanwhile, Kaila Maman of Beachfront Realty, who represented Kodak Black, added that her client plans on transforming the property into a “luxurious retail space” with a restaurant. The artist-turned-real estate investor grew up in a nearby affordable housing complex, called Golden Acres. “He has a lot of ties to that community,” Aquino said. Pompano Beach has seen an influx in real estate development in the last few years. Meanwhile, Kodak Black has had several run-ins with the law. Charges include robbery, battery, false imprisonment of a child, criminal sexual conduct, possession of a firearm and possession of cannabis. In early 2021, Trump pardoned Kodak Black on his gun possession charges. His sentencing had been set two months down the line, on March 24 that year, with the court considering between 2 and 7 years in prison. Last July, he was arrested again for alleged oxycodone pills possession.
