Pedro Pascal’s star has been on the rise lately, with roles in a slew of big franchises such as “The Mandalorian” and “The Last of Us” – but he’s finding out that a higher profile brings inappropriate fan behavior. Pascal, 47, said on the “Graham Norton Show” that some “Star Wars” fans are asking him to use the voice that he uses on “The Mandalorian” to their kids … and the actor isn’t a fan of this request. “People come up to me and ask me to do the voice for their kids. But I think it sounds inappropriate because it is a breathy, low-register bedroom voice. It is so creepy and doesn’t work in real life,” he said. Season 3 of “The Mandalorian” premieres March 1 on Disney+, and it will follow Grogu, a k a the iconic fan favorite “Baby Yoda,” and Din Djarin (Pascal) as they work with other Mandalorians to reclaim the planet of Mandalore. Meanwhile, Pascal is currently starring on the HBO adaptation of the hit video game “The Last of Us” (Sundays at 9 p.m.), where he plays grizzled survivor Joel, who is shepherding teen girl Ellie (Bella Ramsey) across a dangerous post-apocalyptic version of America. Talking to The Post about “The Last of Us” in January, creator Craig Mazin was full of praise for Pascal. “We wanted to find someone that the audience had a little bit of buy-in with already, who they could kind of latch onto,” he said. “Because he’s going to be pulling you through this complicated landscape with lots of people coming in and out as the story progresses. And Pedro has this incredible combination of old-fashioned masculinity and tough-guy exterior, but this wounded soul and pain and vulnerability in the eyes. “Normally, you send a script to an actor at that level and three months later, they’re like ‘Oh yeah, somebody else read it and said it was good. We should meet.’ For Pedro, we sent it to him, and the next morning I was on a Zoom with him. He read it and was so into it. I was like, ‘This is awesome.’”
