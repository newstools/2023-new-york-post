The Mets are set with their rotation heading into 2023, but an important piece of their future suffered yet another setback. Minor league right-hander Matt Allan underwent elbow surgery in January, the team announced Saturday. Allan, a third-round pick in 2019, underwent Tommy John surgery in 2021, then had ulnar nerve transposition surgery in January 2022. The 21-year-old most recently underwent UCL revision surgery last month, which will almost certainly sideline him for another year. There had been hope Allan, selected out of Seminole High School in Sanford, Florida, would move quickly through the minor leagues, but now — due to the surgeries and the COVID-related cancellation of the 2020 minor league season — he hasn’t thrown a pitch in a game since 2019.
