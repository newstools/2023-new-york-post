Ladies and gentlemen, (it’s almost time to) start your engines. On Feb. 16-19, it is Speedweek at Daytona International Speedway, culminating with the Daytona 500. There will be a lot of star power on the track for the biggest race of the year, which leaves us with just one question: How much is it to catch the Super Bowl of racing? Well, it depends on how many days you’re planning on attending. At the time of publication, we found single-day passes for the Daytona 500 going for $139 before fees on Vivid Seats. If you want to make a weekend out of it, Saturday and Sunday two-day passes, which includes the season-opening race, can be picked up for $600 before fees. Completists who are hoping to watch from Thursday-Sunday can find four-day passes for $788 before fees. All prices are subject to fluctuation.  The races get underway on Thursday, Feb. 16 with a series of events including the ARCA Menards Series practice, NASCAR Truck Series practice and then the all-important, 60-lap NASCAR Cup Series Qualifying Races at 7 and 8:45 p.m. Come Friday, the big races are the 3 p.m. NASCAR Truck Series qualifying and 100-lap, 7:30 p.m. NASCAR Truck Series race. On Daytona 500 eve aka Saturday, Feb. 18, the most important contests are the NASCAR Xfinity Series qualifying at 11:30 a.m., the ARCA Menards Series race at 1:30 p.m. and the 120-lap NASCAR Xfinity Series race at 5 p.m. Finally, the main event, 200-lap Daytona 500 will begin at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 19.  Not making the trip to the International Speedway but want to watch from the comfort of your own home? If that’s the case, you’ll need to turn your dial to Fox Sports. No TV? Try the Fox Sports app. The Daytona 500 will be called by play-by-play announcer Mike Joy, analyst Clint Bowyer and NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Tony Stewart.  The 24-year-old Austin Cindric, the 2022 Daytona 500 winner, won as part of Team Penske. This victory made Cindric the second-youngest Daytona 500 champ in NASCAR history. The year prior, Cindric finished 15th in the race; in 2023, NASCAR projects 18-1 odds that he repeats as this year’s winner.  While it’s hard to find a show that will be quite as high-octane or exciting as the Daytona 500, we did our best and tracked down a few. Here are just five of our favorite, can’t-miss artists that may be coming to a city near you soon. • Metallica • Morgan Wallen • George Strait with Chris Stapleton • Blink 182 • Lynyrd Skynyrd with ZZ Top Want to see what else is out there?
