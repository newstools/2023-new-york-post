Seahawks cornerback Tariq Woolen is not impressed with Russell Wilson’s physique. Woolen roasted the current Denver Broncos quarterback and former Seattle Seahawks play-caller during an appearance on the 2 Up 2 Down Podcast this week. “When you see him in person, it’s, like, weird,” Woolen said. “He’s like a sack of potatoes.” “Literally, when I seen him, I’m like, ‘dang, I didn’t know he was built like that,’” the 23-year-old corner continued. “And he was short. I’m tall anyway but I was like, ‘damn, he’s that short?!’” Even so, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound Woolen was impressed by Wilson’s physicality, despite his 5-11”, 215-pound build. “The crazy thing is he’s athletic,” Woolen said. “He’s athletic and he’s a good player.” Warning: Graphic language Wilson and the Broncos lost to the Seahawks 17-16 on Monday Night Football during Week  1 in Seattle. That game would prove to be just the beginning of a disastrous season for Denver, which finished 5-12 after coming into the campaign with playoff hopes. Woolen, meanwhile, enjoyed a standout rookie season for a surprising Seattle team. The UTSA (University of Texas at San Antonio) product and fifth-round draft pick made the Pro Bowl after helping the 9-8 Seahawks to an NFC playoff berth. The Seahawks traded Wilson to Denver before last season. The quarterback had spent the first 10 seasons of his career in Seattle, reaching two Super Bowls and winning one. In September, Wilson agreed to a five-year contract extension with the Broncos worth $245 million. Last month, the Broncos replaced former head coach Nathaniel Hackett, whom Denver fired with two games remaining this past season after he went 4-11, with longtime New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton.
