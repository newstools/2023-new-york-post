Staten Island Chuck is on a hot streak. New York City’s “weatherhog” did not see his shadow early Thursday during the Staten Island Zoo’s annual Groundhog Day ceremony, signaling that springtime is near.

Mayor Eric Adams did not attend the event like his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, who eventually began to skip the tradition after he infamously dropped Chuck’s 10-month-old stand-in, Charlotte, in 2014. Charlotte fell nearly six feet, and died of acute internal injuries a week later. To play it safe, Adams sent in a pre-recorded message for the crowd taken from the safety of City Hall. In place of Adams, Staten Island District Attorney Michael E. McMahon, Assemblyman Michael Tannousis, Councilman David Carr and Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks were in attendance and responsible for sharing Chuck’s forecast This year’s event was livestreamed by the zoo, as it has since the start of the pandemic, in order to prevent crowd
