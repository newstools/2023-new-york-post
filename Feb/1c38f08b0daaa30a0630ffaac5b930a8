It was a royal smackdown. A clip of the late Joan Rivers resurfaced earlier this month in which the former comedian slams Princess Diana. The clip, which was posted last Monday and has been viewed 884,000 times, shows Rivers at a 2013 event claiming the late Princess of Wales “didn’t know when the good times were with her.” “Watch the gay men get quiet,” Rivers said at the time. “You can never say anything to gay men either about Barbra Streisand being ugly or Princess Diana.” “I hated her,” Rivers, who died in 2014 at the age of 81 after a complication during throat surgery, added. “You know why I didn’t like her? Because she didn’t know when the good times were with her. If you don’t know when the good times are with you guys, then you are stupid.” That wasn’t all the late comedian went for in her Diana roast. “I’m not happy,” Rivers went on. “She was tall, she was thin, she was gorgeous, she was young, she was rich, she had a husband who didn’t want to sleep with her. She had a crown!” Another video posted on the account shows the comedian making fun of Prince William giving Kate Middleton his mother’s engagement ring. “Darling I love you very much,” Rivers said pretending to be Prince William talking to Kate Middleton. “I want you to have my mother’s engagement ring. My mother and father hated each other from the very beginning. Good luck!”
