Drake couldn’t do something for Jake Paul. The Youtuber-turned-boxer joked about falling victim to the famous Drake curse following his defeat to Tommy Fury via a split-decision Sunday. Prior to the bout, the rapper revealed on social media that he placed a $400,000 bet on Paul to win by knockout against Fury. “F–k. This is Drake’s fault,” Paul said in a sarcastic tone after hearing about the bet in the post-fight press conference. “Drake, bro, why did you do this to me?” Paul then went on to apologize for failing the rapper: “It’s my fault. $400,000 is nothing to him. He has won a lot more money betting on me before. He’s probably about even now.” Drake has been known to brutally curse those he’s rooted for – excluding the 2019 NBA Champion Raptors. According to The Daily Mail, the “Honestly, Nevermind” rapper has won just one of his seven Super Bowl bets. Paul’s loss, the first of his pro career, puts him at a 6-1 record. The 23-year-old Fury, meanwhile, continues to build his pro resume as he follows in the footsteps of his older half-brother, legendary heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury. Paul said following the bout the two will face each other again. The fight had a rematch clause if Fury won. “Sorry, Drake,” Paul said. “I’ll get that W in the rematch.”
