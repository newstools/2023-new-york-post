If you think you have a lot of money riding on Super Bowl 2023, imagine betting $1 million on it. We already have seen two bettors stake that much on Sunday’s big game between the Eagles and Chiefs, while several others have placed six-figure bets on side bets, totals and even player props in the two weeks leading up to Super Bowl 57. With more than $1 billion expected to come in on this year’s Super Bowl, it’s enough to make your head spin. We’ve compiled the biggest bets on this year’s Super Bowl as of Saturday evening: So far, the two biggest bets of Super Bowl season have both come on the NFC champions. Last weekend, one bettor made a splash with a $1 million bet on the Eagles moneyline (-125) at BetMGM. Five days later, the book revealed a separate bet of $1.25 million at the same price: Caesars has written two other sizable tickets on Sunday’s favorites: one bettor dropped $164,994 on the Eagles’ moneyline (-125) to win just over $130,000, while another staked $150,000 on Philly to cover the spread (-1.5). While most of the betting handle for this year’s Super Bowl is on the favored Eagles, we’ve seen some big bets come in on the Chiefs in the days before the big game. On Thursday, BetMGM shared a bet slip for a half-million on the Kansas City moneyline (+105), which is the biggest confirmed bet on the AFC champions to this point. The next biggest wager came from a bettor in Arizona, who laid down $314,000 to win $200,000 on the Chiefs +3 (-157) at Caesars. That’s not the only big bet that Caesars has taken on Sunday’s underdogs, as one Kansas bettor placed $150,000 on the Chiefs moneyline (+105). Then, on Saturday, a separate bettor risked $210,000 on Kansas City +2 (-105) at the South Point in Las Vegas – which could hint at more big action coming on the Chiefs in the hours before kickoff. And then there’s Drake, who posted his own unconfirmed bet slips on Thursday. The rapper allegedly threw down $700,000 on the Chiefs to win outright (+110) and placed hundreds of thousands on various props, like Patrick Mahomes to score the game’s first touchdown ($50,000 to win $700,000) and Travis Kelce to win Super Bowl MVP ($25,000 to win $225,000). While most big bets have come on the Eagles or Chiefs to win or cover the spread, we’ve also seen some huge wagers on the total and assorted player props – and not just from Drake. Caesars has been the preferred book for big money on the total: one bettor wagered $270,039.85 on the game to go over 50.5 points, while two other bets of $220,000 each were written on the final score finishing under 51 and under 50.5. We’ve seen some big bets on the final score in a much more specific manner. At BetMGM, we’ve already seen two separate bets on the final score – Chiefs 33-30 ($5,000 to win $1 million) and Chiefs 31-26 ($1,600 to win $400,000) – and a $2,500 bet on a scoreless first half that would pay $625,000. As for the Super Bowl MVP market? We’ve seen some wackiness there, too. One BetMGM customer laid $2,500 to win $312,500 on Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell to win it, while someone wagered $100 at PointsBet on backup quarterback Gardner Minshew to win the award. That bet, if it somehow hits, would pay $25,000.
