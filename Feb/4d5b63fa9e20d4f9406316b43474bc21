On Dec. 29, the Arizona Coyotes put a bow on a three-game winning streak with their second win over the Toronto Maple Leafs this season. Although its 13-16-5 record was nothing exemplary, Arizona was earning credit for punching above its weight in a campaign where the Coyotes felt like a lock to finish at, or near, the bottom of the entire NHL. Those days are long gone. Arizona followed that upset over Toronto with a nine-game losing streak and is 3-12-1 in its last 16 games. It looks like a dire time to back the Coyotes, but the spot in the NHL on Monday seems like an excellent chance to try and catch some magic in the desert. (9 p.m. ET, ESPN+) The Minnesota Wild won their last two games before the All-Star break, but their overall form has not been impressive since the New Year. Minnesota has won just six of its first 12 games in 2023 and has a -1 goal differential to show for it. Perhaps more concerning is that the Wild, who have been one of the best five-on-five teams in the league over the past few seasons, have not done a good job driving play of late. Minnesota has a -5 goal difference at five-on-five over its last 10 games, and there’s nothing in the numbers that suggests that the Wild have been unlucky. The Coyotes are a big underdog for a reason, but considering the schedule spot and Minnesota’s form, it seems like Arizona is worth a shot at a big price on Monday night. Coyotes +202 (FanDuel)
