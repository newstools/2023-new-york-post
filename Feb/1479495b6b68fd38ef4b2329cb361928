Talk about a high score. The upcoming film “Cocaine Bear” released a tandem retro-style 8-bit video game Tuesday, called “Cocaine Bear: The Rise of Pablo Escobear.” “Here’s something to entertain you,” wrote the film’s Twitter account. “Play as me” — the titular Cocaine Bear — “and share your high scores.” Players assume the role of the coked-out bear in a “Pac-Man”-style game in which you must collect the small piles of — you guessed it — cocaine, eat several people and eventually chase down an ambulance. Twitter users have found the game very stimulating, so far. “It’s addictive,” quipped one player. “I’d like to say that the social media engagement to promote this movie has been an absolute joy to watch,” tweeted another fan. “I’m sure the film will be as well, but seeing a Cocaine Bear post is usually the coolest thing I see on this damned internet all day.” “We come here today to celebrate this massive W,” a third viewer praised. “Cocaine Bear” tells the shockingly semi-true story of a bear who had a little too much blow — after it was dropped by smugglers in 1985 — and terrorized the denizens of Blue Ridge, Georgia. Police later found stashes of the drug — estimating their collective value to be $20 million at the time — and the ferocious black bear who appeared to have eaten “several million dollars worth of the cocaine,” according to the Associated Press. Sadly, the bear quickly overdosed and died — so the mayhem seen in the new film is mostly a fictionalization. The film is set to roar into theaters on Feb. 24 and stars Keri Russell, Alden Ehrenreich, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Ice Cube and others.
