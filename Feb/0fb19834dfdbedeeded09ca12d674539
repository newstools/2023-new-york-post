The 15-year-old Manhattan boy who was killed while subway surfing on the Williamsburg Bridge was a “funny” and “nice kid,” his grief-stricken mother told The Post Tuesday. Zackery Nazario’s tragic and sudden death on Monday evening has left his family devastated, heartbroken mom Norma Nazario said outside her Alphabet City apartment. “The family is hurt,” she said, describing her son as a “very, very nice kid.” “He was funny… He was my son,” Nazario said. She shared an old school photo of Zackery which she carried in her purse — and said the family was too distraught to speak further. Police said the teen was riding on the roof of a northbound J train speeding across the bridge around 6:45 p.m. when his head hit part of the structure. Sources said Zackery’s girlfriend began to climb on top of the train behind him, and he turned his head back to look at her when he struck the metal beam. The teen then fell underneath the train and was pronounced dead at the scene, cops said. He was the latest victim of the dangerous daredevil stunt that has left other teens dead, maimed or injured over the past several months. “We cannot stress enough how dangerous it is to ride on the outside of trains,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said in a statement following Zackery’s death. “Our hearts go out to loved ones at yet another tragic time. “We implore other families to speak with their children on the real dangers of what can seem like a thrill but is too often deadly,” Davey said. Incidents of subway surfing spiked by 560% from January through May last year, MTA data shows — with 449 incidents compared to just 68 during the same period in 2021.
