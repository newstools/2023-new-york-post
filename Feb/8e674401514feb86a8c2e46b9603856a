A man who was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment last week was murdered — 50 years after he killed someone himself, authorities said Monday. Donald Wallace, 75, was discovered unconscious and unresponsive inside his West 23rd Street apartment in NYCHA’s Carey Gardens complex in Coney Island after police responded to a 911 call there around 5:20 p.m. Thursday, cops said. He was pronounced dead at the scene by EMS, and officials say it appeared he suffered blunt-force trauma to the head. Wallace served 20 years in state prison for a 1972 murder, state records show. He was also charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and grand larceny at the time. After being released from prison, he headed back behind bars for a two- to four-year stint in 1996 on drug charges, records show.
