She’s feeling the Bries. Alison Brie shocked not only her husband, Dave Franco, but also her social media fans on Thursday when she posted a video on Instagram of herself running naked through the hallways of Los Angeles’ London West Hollywood hotel. “What to do when your husband is feeling anxious about his movie premiere,” the 40-year-old wrote in the caption. In the video, the “GLOW” star is seen running down the hall completely nude before knocking on the couple’s door. “Waiting on Dave to answer … he thinks I’m in the shower,” reads the Insta caption. Moments later, a robe-clad Franco, 37, opens the door and looks away in shock. “Happy premiere night,” the actress yells at a bemused-looking Franco, who asks her to “get out of the hall!” and come inside the room. “I’ve done three laps already,” said the “Lego Movie” star. Franco and Brie were in LA for the premiere of “Somebody I Used to Know,” which was written by the couple, directed by Franco and stars Brie. It’s now available on Amazon Prime. The couple appeared on “The Late Late Show With James Cordon,” where Franco said that it was the least surprising thing that has happened. “As much as it was a shock to my system to open the door, it was also the least surprising thing that’s happened this year to find her naked in the hallway of the London hotel,” joked the “Now You See Me” actor. Several social media users found the video hysterical. “Dude is married to her, so why is he looking away?” said one user. “Imagine you pop out of your room to get ice and Alison Brie runs by naked,” a second person joked. “This is cute,” gushed comedian Chelsea Handler.
