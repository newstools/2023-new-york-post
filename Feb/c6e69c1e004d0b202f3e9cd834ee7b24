Howard Stern does not love the way you lie, Rihanna. The shock jock claimed the pop diva lip-synced for about “85 percent” of her gravity-defying performance during Sunday’s Super Bowl LVII halftime show. “You know, I don’t even know why she bothered showing up,” he said during Monday’s episode of “The Howard Stern Show” on Sirius XM. “I could be wrong, but I — in my opinion, 85 percent of that performance was lip sync.” Stern’s longtime co-host, Robin Quivers, chimed in to say she couldn’t tell for sure whether Rihanna was singing at certain points. “Well, the big giveaway might be when she puts the microphone down by her knees and her lips aren’t moving and the other voices are going,” Stern replied. Rihanna performed “Umbrella,” “Diamonds” and a slew of her other hits — but not “Love the Way You Lie” — while suspended in midair on a floating platform during the 13-minute performance. The singer’s appearance with a noticeable baby bump sparked a firestorm of speculation on social media questioning whether she was pregnant after giving birth to her first child last May. Rihanna’s rep confirmed after the performance that the pop star was indeed pregnant with her second child. Stern made a raunchy reference to Rihanna’s pregnancy during his rant about the show. “I had a theory, Rihanna was not lip-syncing, but she put the microphone near her vagina so the new baby could sing,” Stern said. “The baby was singing backup.” Mediaite earlier reported on Stern’s comments. The halftime show marked something of a comeback for RiRi, who hasn’t released a new album in several years while devoting more time to her booming Savage X Fenty lingerie company and other business pursuits.
