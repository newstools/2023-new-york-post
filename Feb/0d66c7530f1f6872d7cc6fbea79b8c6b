Regé-Jean Page is addressing those James Bond rumors. The dapper “Bridgerton” star, 34, told Vanity Fair, “It’s a conversation people are having, and it’s terribly flattering that they’re having it. I leave them to it.” But when asked if he would play the iconic spy, he said, “I have no idea. It’s not a thing that is fully occupying my thoughts. I’ve got enough on my plate at the moment. I worry about the work I have, not other people’s jobs.” Other A-list actors rumored to be in the mix for Bond after Daniel Craig’s departure include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 32; Richard Madden, 36; Idris Elba, 50; Tom Hardy, 45; and Henry Cavill, 39. Page rose to fame in 2020, playing a dashing duke in the first season of Shonda Rhimes’ steamy Regency-era hit. So he’s the most recently famous of the potential Bond contenders. But he might have an edge above the others, since according to science, he is officially the most handsome man in the world. (He told Vanity Fair about that topic, “Allegedly … No one’s proven it in a court of law.”). “Bridgerton” returned for a second season sans Page, following different lead characters (and featuring less sex, much to viewers’ ire). Although there was a lot of buzz around Page departing the show, he said there was no drama on his end. “I signed up to do a job and I did the job and then I did some other jobs,” Page said. He added, “That’s it. That’s the story. I wish it was more glamorous than that. [After] we finished the story, the temptation would be to roll with the distractions and go, ‘Oh, well, the story went really well so we can kind of change this up and make some other stuff up, I guess.’ That was never what we’d signed up to do.” Since then, Page appeared in the Netflix movie “The Gray Man” with Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, and he’s set to co-star in the 2023 film “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” with Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez and Hugh Grant.
