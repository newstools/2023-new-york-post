Shaun O’Hara will always remember the day that Tom Brady retired for a second time. The former Giants great was on NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football” on Wednesday as Brady shared a beach selfie video that broke the news he was stepping away from the NFL after 23 seasons. “This is a huge moment, not just for Tom Brady, not just for the NFL, but for all of us,” O’Hara marveled. “People remember where they were when JFK was assassinated. They remember where they were for 9/11.” Peter Schrager interjected: “Can I interrupt you real quick? His first start was the week after 9/11. That’s how long he’s been playing!” O’Hara, who made three consecutive Pro Bowls as the Giants’ center from 2008-10, continued to stress the magnitude of the news. “I came out [of college] the same year as him, 2000, and he’s still playing!” O’Hara said. “Twenty-three years. That’s a long time. I’m gonna remember this. I’m gonna remember who I’m with. Kyle [Brandt]’s gonna remember he was in Vegas. You’re gonna remember where you were when Tom Brady announced his official retirement — and it sounds like this one’s for real.” Elsewhere in the program, Schrager revealed that the 45-year-old Brady had actually surreptitiously pre-filmed his retirement video, despite having purported to have woke up and filmed it on Wednesday morning. “That was filmed a while ago,” Schrager informed viewers, as covered by Mass Live. “He was at an L.A. premiere last night, doing the movie premiere [for “80 for Brady”]. The sun is not up in L.A. as you see there. So that is a taping, that means he has known this and has kept this quiet for at least 48 hours.” O’Hara, 45, was part of the Giants team that beat Brady and the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.
