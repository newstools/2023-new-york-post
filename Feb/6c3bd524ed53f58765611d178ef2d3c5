He’s snot your average heartthrob. Mucinex’s mischievous mascot Mr. Mucus has officially become a sex symbol. The animated villain — who seeks to make his sick victims as miserable as possible — has gotten an upgrade and social media users have taken note. Mr. Mucus is no longer a 2-dimensional animated green blob as seen in the Mucinex commercials.  The mascot now has an unverified social media account that introduces a live-action version of the mascot — and that’s apparently a turn-on for some people. The Post reached out to Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Mucinex, for comment. A now-viral video — which was posted to celebrate the new year — shows Mr. Mucus celebrating the start of 2023 by grooving to some tunes. That video now has more than 200,000 views. Another video on his account to celebrate the new year shows him going through his list of resolutions. “In 2023, I’m living my sickest life! Here are my Flu Year’s Resolutions,” reads the video caption. The video reveals that the snotty dude is just like us — he brushes his teeth, he spends time outside and he enjoys reading. Social media users with Mr. Mucus fever couldn’t contain themselves in the comments section of his videos. “I want you,” said one user. “I can help you stretch Mr. Mucus;),” said another. “Is there a Mrs.Mucus,” a third person chimed in. People were equally thirsty for the green blob in a follow-up video of Mr. Mucus dancing around a fire. “That fire isn’t as hot as the thought of having you with me Mr Mucus,” one person said. “I am getting down on one knee, ring in hand, hoping to take your hand in holy matrimony,” proposed another. “Makin’ me blush!” replied the account.
