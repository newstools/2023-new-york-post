His eggcellent plan didn’t hatch quite right. A UK man is facing two years in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to stealing nearly 200,000 Cadbury Creme Eggs worth over $37,000, according to news reports. Joby Pool, 32, was charged with criminal damage and two counts of theft after towing away the trailer full of chocolate Saturday. West Mercia Police dubbed the candy-coated caper an “eggs-travagent theft.” Pool appeared Tuesday in Kidderminster Magistrates Court, where prosecutors argued his Easter-Bunny-in-reverse behavior would have taken “significant planning” to pull off. According to the Guardian, Pool reportedly used a metal grinder to get through the gates of the unit housing the chocolate-stuffed trailer and used a stolen truck with false plates to steal it. Pool was later spotted by police, who claimed he walked toward them with his hands up. They recovered the sweet spoils after easily cracking the case. “This is clearly an organized criminal matter,” prosecutor Owen Beale told the court. “You don’t just happen to learn about a trailer with that kind of value being available.” Pool, from West Yorkshire, was previously convicted of theft, handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified in 2019, the Guardian reports. He’s eggspecting to be sentenced on March 14.
