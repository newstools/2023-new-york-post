Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has revealed that both her sons are MSU students — and ripped how even as “the top law enforcement official in this state,” she is helpless against the plague of mass shootings. “As a parent, there is no greater fear than having your child tell you there is an active shooter at their school,” she said of twins Alex and Zach. “I experienced this terror along with thousands of other MSU families,” Nessel first said in a statement soon after Monday night’s bloodbath. Nessel later told MSNBC that one of her sons “had just left the first location of the shooting just prior” to Anthony Dwayne McRae, 43, bursting in and shooting dead two of his three victims. “I can’t believe that as a parent in the United States of America, you can’t move your child into college without seriously having to wonder whether or not they’re going to make it through the next four years … without being a victim of a mass shooting,” she said. “That was a concern I had when I moved my kids into school a year and a half ago — and I couldn’t even make it through their sophomore year without an incident like this happening. “I’m the top law enforcement official in this state — and I couldn’t prevent a tragedy like this from happening,” she continued. “We have to start loving our kids more than we love our guns.” Nessel said her sons — whom she is raising with wife Alanna Maguire — are “scared.” “They’re shaken up. A lot of their friends are leaving campus right now,” she said, adding she has discussed the same option for the boys, especially given how “classes have been canceled for the foreseeable future.” Despite her powerful position, she said, she “fears” that the federal courts will “significantly diminish the ability of states” to “pass and to have meaningful legislation to prevent gun violence-related crimes.” “And certainly Congress has done us virtually no favors at all. This is a national problem. And we need a national solution,” she said.
