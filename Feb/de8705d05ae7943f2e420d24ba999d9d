Jae Crowderâ€™s time with the Nets will be a footnote. The veteran forward was part of the deal that sent Kevin Durant to the Suns, but the Nets quickly turned around Thursday and shipped Crowder to the Bucks in a three-way trade with the Pacers. The Athletic was the first to report the deal. The Nets are getting back three of the five second-round picks the Bucks are giving away, with the Pacers acquiring two of them and Jordan Nwora. Crowder, 32, had been pushing for a trade out of Phoenix all season after failing to get an extension this offseason. He did not play at all this season for the Suns. Crowder is a 34.6% career 3-point shooter and will add depth for a Bucks team that is currently the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference.
