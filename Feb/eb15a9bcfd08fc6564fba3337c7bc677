A man was critically hurt when he grabbed onto his moving car to try to stop a trio of thieves from driving off with it in Queens late Monday, cops said. The 28-year-old victim was standing outside his vehicle, which he had left running, at Lefferts Boulevard and Liberty Avenue in South Richmond Hill around 10:45 p.m. when three suspects jumped into his ride, police said. The victim grabbed onto the roof rack of his car as the suspects sped down the street in the vehicle, authorities said. The thief behind the wheel soon ended up striking a fire hydrant, flinging the victim off the car and causing the vehicle to flip over, cops said. The car owner remained in critical condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center on Tuesday morning. Two of the suspects were caught by responding cops, and charges are pending against them. The other suspect fled and has not been caught. It was not immediately clear whether the victim knew the men who snatched his ride.
