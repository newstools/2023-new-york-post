Sometimes on a loaded college basketball Saturday, you need to look a little deeper for the best value on the board. That’s the case this Saturday when Massachusetts goes on the road to face La Salle. The line in this game is around pick ’em, but it’s two teams going in opposite directions. La Salle has won three straight and is in its best form of the season right now. Meanwhile, UMass comes in having lost three in a row and seven of 10. I was high on the Minutemen entering Frank Martin’s first season, but after a fast start, UMass has struggled in conference play, particularly away from home. The last time the Minutemen won a true road game was Dec. 2 against in-state rival Harvard. UMass is 0-6 on the road in conference play, losing by an average of 13.6 points. La Salle’s recent success is thanks to an improved offense. Despite ranking 248th in offensive efficiency, the Explorers are averaging 74.6 points in their three wins. Overall, the improved La Salle offense has topped 70 points in five of its last six games. These two teams met in Amherst on Jan. 11 with La Salle getting the 78-77 road win. In that game, the Explorers shot 62.9 percent from two-point range. Look for another efficient offensive performance this time around as the Explorers get the season sweep at home. The play: La Salle, -3.
