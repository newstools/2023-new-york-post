A high-ranking police union official was caught working at a Washington, DC, Whole Foods while on the department’s clock — after someone at the store accused him of sexual misconduct. Medgar Webster, the former vice chair of the Metropolitan Police union, was arrested and charged with felony fraud last weekend after an investigation into allegations of “unwanted sexual contact” by someone at Whole Foods. It is not clear whether the alleged victim was an employee or a customer. MPD paid Webster, 52, $33,845, including overtime and holiday pay, while he was working at the market, according to the arrest affidavit cited by Washington City Paper. In total, Webster raked in nearly $46,000 while working at two Whole Foods locations between January 2021 and April 2022. Police officers in the nation’s capital are allowed to have other jobs, but the second one cannot conflict with department rules and needs to be authorized, which Webster did not do, according to the affidavit. Police Union Chair Greggory Pemberton told DCist that Webster resigned from his union position nearly a year ago to pursue his retirement, and was stripped of his police powers amid the sexual abuse investigation. Webster faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty.
