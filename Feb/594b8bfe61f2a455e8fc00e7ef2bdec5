He has a “Heart of Gold.” Rock star Neil Young made a surprise appearance this weekend at a protest condemning the logging of old-growth trees in Canada. “It’s a precious, sacred thing, these old trees because they show us the power of nature when we are being threatened,” said Young, 77. “They show us the past, and they show us our future.” The longtime environmental activist appeared unannounced and performed for a frenzied crowd for the first time since 2019. “Sometimes you organize a rally and rock legend Neil Young comes and sings at it as a surprise,” tweeted protest organizer Torrance Coste alongside a video of Young’s performance. Young announced in mid-2019 that he was postponing his tour to focus on film projects. “We plan to be back in 2020,” he wrote on his website — only to be postponed again by COVID-19. During the pandemic, the “Comes a Time” singer performed several online concerts and slammed those who performed live, calling concerts “super-spreader events.” “I don’t think it is safe in the pandemic,” Young said on his site. “I miss it very much.” The Post reached out to Young for comment. While Young has no plans for touring at the moment, he is scheduled to appear with Stephen Stills at a charity event for Autism Speaks in April and then at the Hollywood Bowl to celebrate Willie Nelson’s 90th birthday.
