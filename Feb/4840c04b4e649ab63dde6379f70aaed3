Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Wednesday: Tylor Megill, Edwin Diaz, Adam Ottavino and Stephen Nogosek all threw live batting practice Wednesday, with Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor, Luis Guillorme, Tomas Nido and Omar Narvaez taking at-bats. Manager Buck Showalter turned his back to the mound when Diaz entered, saying he didn’t need to watch because he’s “pretty sure” the right-hander will make the team. Guillorme poked a single to right field against Diaz. Joey Cora stood near the third-base coaching box during live batting practice and simulated getting into position as pitches were thrown. Cora has told Showalter that he wants to be ready from the first exhibition game, and it takes time to reacclimate to coaching third base. The Mets will continue full-squad workouts at Clover Park.
