Cody Longo, an actor known for a role on “Days of Our Lives,” has died. He was 34. His wife Stephanie confirmed the news to The Post on Friday. “Cody was our whole world. The kids and I are shattered and beyond devastated,” she said in a statement. “He was the best dad and best father. We will always and forever miss you and love you.” He leaves behind the couple’s three young kids: a 7-year-old daughter, a 5-year-old son and a 1-year-old son. A family member claimed to TMZ that Stephanie asked police to perform a wellness check on him in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday because she allegedly could not reach him. Officials reportedly kicked down the door at home in Austin, Texas, and found Longo dead in bed, according to TMZ, which reported that a family member alleged that Longo had struggled with alcohol abuse for years and went to rehab last summer. In November 2020, Longo was arrested for domestic assault in Tennessee when he reportedly was involved in a drunken fight with his wife. That was also the last year he was listed as having an acting role, according to IMDb. Longo appeared as the character Jess in eight episodes of “Days of Our Lives” in 2011. He also portrayed Eddie Duran in 78 episodes of the 2012 Nick at Nite series “Hollywood Heights.” His other credits include “CSI” NY,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “Medium,” “Bring It On: Fight to The Finish” and “Nashville.”
