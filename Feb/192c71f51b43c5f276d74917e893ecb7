The Nets were forced to trade their two superstars and their future is in complete flux. But they’re committing to their head coach. Jacque Vaughn has signed a multi-year contract extension with Brooklyn, the team announced Tuesday morning. Vaughn has the Nets at 34-24 and in fifth place in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break. The move comes weeks after the Nets moved on from both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Irving requested a trade after failed negotiations on a contract extension, and Durant wanted out after Irving was dealt to the Mavericks. Brooklyn then traded Durant to the Suns. “Jacque has made an immediate and immeasurable impact on our entire organization since assuming the role of head coach earlier this season,” Nets general manager Sean Marks, whose own future is in question after the trades, said in a statement. “On the court, he’s clearly demonstrated his leadership through his ability to connect and communicate at a very high level while displaying tremendous instincts for the game. As a person, they don’t come any better than Jacque. His character is impeccable, and there is not a better representative for our team and our borough.” The 48-year-old was beginning his seventh season as an assistant for the Nets when he took over as interim head coach after Steve Nash was fired seven games into the season. He then became the permanent head coach after Brooklyn briefly explored the idea of hiring former Celtics coach Ime Udoka, who was suspended by Boston for the entire 2022-23 season over an improper consensual relationship with a female staffer. Vaughn was head coach of the Magic for two-plus seasons from 2012-15, losing his job 52 games into the 2014-15 season. He joined the Nets in 2016 after spending one year as a scout for the Spurs. The former guard played 12 seasons in the NBA for the Jazz, Hawks, Magic, Nets and Spurs and was part of the San Antonio team that won a championship in 2007.
