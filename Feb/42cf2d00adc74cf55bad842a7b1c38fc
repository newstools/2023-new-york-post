They’re trans-cending all limits. Singer-songwriters Sam Smith and Kim Petras have made music history as the first ever non-binary and transgender artists to take home Grammys gold in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category. “I’m the first transgender woman to win this award,” said an emotional Petras, 30, clad in crimson. “I want to thank all the incredible transgender legends before me who kicked these doors open.” She went on to thank her mother, her late friend Sophie, LGBTQ+ advocate and pop music icon Madonna, 64. The trendily hot twosome sent tongues wagging in fiery red outfits while accepting the accolade for their chart-topping duet “Unholy” at the awards show Sunday. Smith, 30, came out as non-binary in 2019, and changed their pronouns to they/them in September of that year. Petras, a singer-songwriter from Westphalia, Germany, is transgender. She recently revealed that her cheeky use of religious themes in music is a means of healing from trauma spurred by pious critics. “I just, since a young age, had to be like, ‘I’m going to hell.’ That was my growing up experience,” Petras told the Associated Press. “Had I had the chance to be a part of a religion, I maybe would have. And maybe I would have lived more the way that people who protest my concerts want me to live.” Smith and Petras’ monumental win was preceded by Brazilian singer Liniker, 27, who became the first trans artist to win a Latin Grammy in 2022. And in 1968, Wendy Carlos, 83, became the first openly trans woman to win three Grammy awards for her groundbreaking masterpiece “Switched-On Bach.”
