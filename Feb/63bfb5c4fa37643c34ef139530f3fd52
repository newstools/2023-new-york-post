Jeremy Renner has given another update on his recovery from his snowplow accident. Renner, who was critically injured in an incident in Nevada on New Year’s Day, posted a behind-the-scenes photo from his Disney+ series “Rennervations” to Instagram, saying the program is “coming soon.” “Behind the scenes on #rennervations coming soon on @disneyplus around the world! We are cueing up now @disney and @disneyplus to launch this amazing new show. More info to come,” Renner wrote in the caption. He added: “Thank you for your patience … while I am in the shop now, working on me.” Earlier this month, the 52-year-old actor posted that the show was still coming — even after he was hospitalized after “experiencing a weather-related accident while plowing snow” and suffering “extensive” injuries, breaking over 30 bones, in Lake Tahoe. “As soon as I’m back on my feet, we are coming to YOU, all across the globe… I hope you’re ready !!!” he wrote in a previous post. The show follows Renner around the world as he helps others by “reimagining unique purpose-built vehicles to meet a community’s needs.” “Behind the big screen, Jeremy is a construction aficionado, and he is heavily invested in the highly creative fabricator culture that exists across the globe and hopes to change lives with these skills and inspire others to do the same,” the series’ press release states. Prior to his accident, the “Avengers” actor shared a teaser trailer for the four-part series on Instagram, writing, “There’s no better way to kick off the new year than giving back to those who need it most!” “Rennervations” was initially set to debut in early 2023.
