The Jets painted a big picture for Derek Carr. Gang Green hosted the free agent quarterback on Monday and the visit went “really well from both sides,” according to ESPN’s Dianna Russini. “They were pretty clear with him — they told him he’s a great quarterback, they told him he’s got a legit surrounding cast of players,” Russini said on “NFL Live” on Tuesday. “… they ran top-to-bottom of why Derek Carr can step in here and take this team, not just to the playoffs, but to the Super Bowl.” While the Jets aren’t alone in courting Carr — he visited with the Saints but would not give his permission to be traded by the Raiders before they released him — they did offer a grandiose vision of what the 31-year-old could accomplish in New York. “[The Jets] made it super personal, too,” Russini said. “They said ‘We believe if you come to New York and win, you could be a first-ballot Hall of Famer.’ According to Carr’s brother, David, an NFL Network analyst and former quarterback, Derek “hit if off” with Jets coach Robert Saleh. “He went there to get a feel for how they work from the top down,” David Carr said on “NFL Total Access” on Monday. “Everyone he met, and we knew he would love Robert Saleh. I’ve known Robert for a while. He’s fantastic and they hit it off and they would love to work together.” The good vibes around meeting could prove to be problematic for the Jets as they try to solve one of the biggest organizational issues after Zach Wilson’s second-year face plant. The Post’s Brian Costello reported ahead of the Super Bowl that the Jets engaged in “preliminary discussions” with the Packers regarding Aaron Rodgers, though the mercurial QB has yet to make up his mind regarding his future in Green Bay. Waiting for the 39-year-old to decide could see Carr go off the market and leave the Jets in a costly scenario in terms of trade assets and salary cap hit if they were unable to land a quarterback in free agency.
