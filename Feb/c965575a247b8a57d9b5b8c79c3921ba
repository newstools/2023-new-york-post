Gus Kenworthy would like the booth to review this call. The Olympic silver medalist claimed that his cameo in the film “80 for Brady” — starring screen icons Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sally Field and Rita Moreno — was cut to please Middle America, reports Variety. Kenworthy, 31, said that he was slated to “make out” with his on-screen boyfriend, played by “M3gan” star Brian Jordan Alvarez; however, the scene never made it into the film. “They said they had to cut it for time, but I think they cut it for Middle America,” slammed the “American Horror Story: 1984” actor. The athlete revealed that he and Alvarez, 35, performed several takes of the steamy scene. “They used the script for one take, but then we did it like four or five times where we would just ad-lib insults at each other and then make out,” the world-class freestyle skier. “Some of them got raunchy.” “Release the tapes,” demanded the athlete jokingly. “See if you can get that trending.” The Post reached out to Paramount for comment. The film — which was inspired by a true story — follows four football fans and their pilgrimage to 2017’s Super Bowl LI in hopes of witnessing a Patriots victory. This past weekend, star Moreno, 91, told Entertainment Weekly that her dancing skills had to be toned down, to ensure her technique matched the level of her co-stars. “I was trying to find a way to not dance well,” the “West Side Story” legend bragged. “I was dancing down. Because the first thing I ran into when we realized we had to do this little dance was that everybody, to the woman, said, ‘Oh, my God, but you’re the dancer.’ And they wouldn’t stop with that.” Field, 76, also recently spilled that retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady was “nervous” when he was filming his scenes. “He told me, ‘I’m so nervous.’ He felt like he didn’t know where to put his feet. But he was a natural,” Field gushed.
