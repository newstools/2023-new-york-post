There are many different ways to handicap the Super Bowl matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. One major edge I see for the Eagles is that they own the best offensive line in the NFL. Everyone talks about Philadelphia getting a break in the NFC Championship game because the 49ers literally couldn’t throw a forward pass in the second half. That’s true, but the Chiefs caught a break, too. Kansas City faced a Bengals’ offensive line that was down three starters. The Bills couldn’t expose that weakness in the divisional round, but that game was played on turf in the snow, where pass rushers can be negated. The Chiefs exploited Cincinnati’s depleted line, finishing with five sacks. Now Kansas City will face an offense that averaged more than 148 rushing yards per game in the regular season. Look for the Eagles to come out and try to mash the Chiefs’ defense on the ground. Kansas City’s defense ranks 18th in the NFL in yards per attempt, so expect to see a lot of the Eagles’ three-headed monster at running back. For player props, I like the Over for Kenneth Gainwell’s rushing yards and rushing attempts. He’s averaging 13 carries and 80 yards in two playoff games. The blueprint to beat Patrick Mahomes over the years has been an offense going on long drives that end in touchdowns and a defense able to pressure the quarterback. The Eagles check both boxes. Philadelphia ranks third in scoring touchdowns in the red zone and led the NFL with 70 sacks. Look for them to dominate in the trenches on both sides of the bal.  I’m following the early money and taking the Eagles to win their second Super Bowl in the past six years. Eagles moneyline (-125).
