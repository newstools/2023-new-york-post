A.J. McCarron’s XFL debut is a moment his wife, Katherine Webb, will never forget. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Webb — who has been married to the former NFL quarterback since 2014 — posted a sweet snapshot of McCarron on the field with one of the couple’s three young sons after his St. Louis Battlehawks defeated the San Antonio Brahmas in Sunday’s season opener. “All for them. What a game!” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum, 33, captioned the post. McCarron helped lead the Battlehawks to a thrilling comeback win over the Brahmas, 18-15, after scoring two touchdowns in the final moments of the game, with St. Louis also converting for three points. XFL teams can convert for an extra point on the 2-yard line, two points on the 5-yard line, or three points from the 10-yard line, in accordance with the league’s rulebook. Webb, who rose to notoriety in 2013 when Brent Musburger commented about her looks in the BCS National Championship game, penned a heartfelt message to McCarron, 32, on Instagram following Sunday’s victory. “Not many ppl know how meaningful this win was but you a baddd man,” Webb posted on her Instagram story. McCarron was overcome with emotion in a postgame interview, where he was joined by two of his sons. “It’s awesome,” McCarron said of playing in front of his children. “It means a lot.” A fifth-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, McCarron began his NFL career with the Bengals before bouncing around the league in the years that followed, with his last stop being the Falcons in 2021. He was drafted by the Battlehawks in November. The Battlehawks will visit the Seattle Sea Dragons on Thursday.
