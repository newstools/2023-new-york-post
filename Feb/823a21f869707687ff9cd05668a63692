The football season has come to an end, and now, pitchers and catchers are reporting to spring training. Baseball is here and it’s a beautiful thing. This March will have a different feel as it’s a World Baseball Classic year. Teams are gearing up without some of their stars, who will play for their respective countries. Team USA is led by manager Mark DeRosa, who was the guest this week on “The Show” podcast with Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman.
