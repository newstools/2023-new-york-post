A groovy pop-up is opening its doors on Saturday. Looking for a fresh way to skate through the rest of the winter blues? This 24,000-square-foot venue with a 9,000-square-foot rink at the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn is just the place. From this weekend until June 4, borough native Harry Martin will be hosting wheeled revelers at the latest incarnation of his “traveling pop-up skating experience,” RollerWave, in Prospect Heights. The disco will feature a rotating roster of DJs, food and drink, an arcade, a live podcast space and a VIP section, according to AMNY. In addition to providing a venue for skaters, there will also be various community events — including wellness classes, skating lessons and family programs — at the location, which will be sandwiched between the Old Navy and Party City outlet stores at 625 Atlantic Ave. The roller business, which Martin started in 2016, has previously had pop-ups across the boroughs — as well as in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami. “We are thrilled to welcome such an exciting and nostalgic experience back to the heart of Brooklyn,” said Ehud Kupperman, head of the retail portfolio for Atlantic Terminal’s corporate owner, Madison International Realty, 6sqft reported. Indeed, RollerWave’s newest location is relatively close to Crown Heights’ former Empire Roller Disco, which opened in 1941 and became a landmark establishment in the subsequent decades before closing in 2007, at which point it was the last remaining rink in New York City, according to Brownstoner. Since then, the pastime has had a major resurgence. RollerWave will be open from noon to 10 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays — and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, with all ages welcome until 8 p.m., after which it will be adults only. Tickets — which can be purchased on the company’s website — are priced at $19.50 for adults and $14.50 for children, with a $10 skate rental for full-grown humans and $5 for kids.
