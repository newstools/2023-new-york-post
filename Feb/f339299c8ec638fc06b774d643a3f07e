Call it another smoke signal that Patrick Kane’s days as a Blackhawk could be numbered as the Rangers continue to try and strike a deal for the All-Star winger. Kane is being held out of Chicago’s game Saturday night against the San Jose Sharks as his name continues to circulate in trade rumors ahead of the NHL’s deadline on March 3. The Rangers are among the teams trying to acquire the services of the three-time Stanley Cup winner. Sam Lafferty also did not suit up for Chicago. The Blueshirts again held out Vitali Kravtsov —then traded him to the Canucks — and Jake Leschyshyn, who they waived during their game against the Capitals in Saturday, due to roster management. The moves free up enough cap space and roster spot to allow the Rangers to deal for the Chicago star. Kane, according to reports, has not agreed to waive his no-movement clause yet. “Based on the current status of Patrick’s situation, we collectively felt it was more appropriate to have him not play during this period of reflection,” Kane’s agent Pat Brisson told TSN. Kane, 34, did not practice Friday, getting what the team called a “maintenance day.” Kravtsov had previously requested a trade from the Rangers and had not played since Feb. 10. The Rangers dealt him for Will Lockwood and a 2026 seventh-round pick. Kane, a player who has been linked as a potential Rangers trade target for months, has 16 goals and 29 assists this season. While the Blackhawks have been one of the NHL’s worst teams, Kane has been keeping an eye on what’s happening on Broadway. The Rangers are currently third in the Metropolitan division, six points behind the second-place Devils. “I think the Rangers are a team that you definitely pay attention to and definitely are intrigued by, for obvious reasons,” Kane said in February after the Rangers traded for Vladimir Tarasenko. If the Rangers have their way, the two will be teammates this season.
