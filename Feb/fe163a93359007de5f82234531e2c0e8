Something’s got to change for the Yankees after another promising season was ended at the hands of the eventual World Series champion Astros in the ALCS. What won’t change at least — and for a while — will be Aaron Judge in pinstripes after the right-fielder inked a nine-year, $360 million contract this offseason. Judge smashed an AL record 62 homers in 2022. He was also named team captain for this season. The next biggest splash GM Brian Cashman made was upgrading the starting rotation with prized free agent Carlos Rodon. Who the Yankees shortstop will be remains the biggest mystery with top prospects Oswald Peraza and Anthony Volpe competing with incumbent Isiah Kiner-Falefa. Here is the 2023 Yankees depth chart to start spring training. 1B: Anthony Rizzo, DJ LeMahieu, Oswaldo Cabrera 2B: Gleyber Torres, DJ LeMahieu, Oswaldo Cabrera SS: Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Oswald Peraza, Anthony Volpe 3B: Josh Donaldson, DJ LeMahieu, Isiah Kiner-Falefa LF: Aaron Hicks, Oswaldo Cabrera, Estevan Florial CF: Harrison Bader, Aaron Judge, Aaron Hicks RF: Aaron Judge, Oswaldo Cabrera, Estevan Florial C: Jose Trevino, Kyle Higashioka, Ben Rortvedt DH: Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge, Josh Donaldson SP: RHP Gerrit Cole, LHP Carlos Rodon, LHP Nestor Cortes, RHP Luis Severino, RHP Frankie Montas*, RHP Domingo German, RHP Clarke Schmidt, RHP Jhony Brito, RHP Randy Vasquez, RHP Deivi Garcia RP: RHP Clay Holmes, LHP Wandy Peralta, RHP Jonathan Loaisiga, RHP Michael King, RHP Tommy Kahnle, RHP Ron Marinaccio, RHP Lou Trivino, RHP Albert Abreu, RHP Greg Weissert, RHP Jimmy Cordero *out with injury to start season
