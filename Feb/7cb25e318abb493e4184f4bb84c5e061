A conference game between Mississippi Valley State and Alabama A&M took a wild turn Saturday when a cheerleader was ejected after being involved in an on-court altercation with a player. With about three minutes remaining in the second half, an Alabama A&M player appeared to make contact with a Mississippi Valley State cheerleader during her routine — as she jumped into the air near the baseline, where junior guard/forward Dailin Smith was inbounding the ball. Play continued down at the other end of the court, but the next time play returned in front of the Mississippi Valley State cheerleaders, the same cheerleader walked onto the court after a whistle and proceeded to push Smith. The game then stopped — as the broadcast team recounted what happened — before security was called, and a group of at least seven people walked across the court to the cheerleader, who grabbed a jacket and was escorted off the court. “The Alabama A&M coach, he’s fussing,” Caleb Brunson, one member of the broadcast said. “He’s fussing and cussing.” “Yeah, coach is kinda losing it over here,” Andre Williams, the other member of the broadcast team, added. After a brief pause, Brunson revealed that “they’re gonna put one of the cheerleaders out of the game.” The craziness continued even after the cheerleader ejection, as Alabama State ended up winning, 70-68, on a last-second shot. Junior guard Messiah Thompson dribbled at the top of the key with five seconds remaining, before dribbling right and drilling a last-second shot as he faded away from the basket. The victory improved Alabama A&M’s record to 10-15, with a 6-6 record in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Mississippi State dropped to 3-23, with a 2-10 conference record, and missed out on the opportunity to secure an upset with less than a month until the conference tournament. That was the final meeting between the two teams in the regular season. Alabama A&M defeated Mississippi State, 75-68, on Jan. 4.
