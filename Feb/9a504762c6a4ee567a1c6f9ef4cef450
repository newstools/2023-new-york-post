Both teams are aiming for the play-in line and every game counts at this point, which should make this afternoon’s game between the Wizards and Bulls in Chicago a lot of fun. Washington has hovered around .500 for a good chunk of the season with Bradley Beal, Kristaps Porzingis, and Kyle Kuzma leading the way, while guys like Monte Morris and Corey Kispert have done well in supplemental roles.
