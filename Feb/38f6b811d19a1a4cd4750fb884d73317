How many times a day are you applying moisturizer? If it’s not at least two, (morning and night) you’re in trouble, especially during the harsh winter months. There’s nothing worse than turning up to work, or a first date, or Valentine’s Day dinner, or the Post Office (really anywhere) with a patch of dry skin on your face. It’s unseemly. Plus, dry skin leads to breakouts and dermatologists, along with the FDA, recommend that you apply some form of SPF every day, to reduce the risk of skin cancer, and related diseases. Luckily, there’s a solution. And even luckier, that solution is on sale. This week, Amazon is offering their #1 bestselling facial moisturizer, CeraVe’s AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion, for a sweet 27% off. That’s on top of an Amazon sale on another CeraVe bestseller, their Eye Repair Cream, that we reported on last week. Apparently, it’s CeraVe season. CeraVe’s AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion offers broad spectrum SPF 30, and is designed to spread easily, absorb quickly, and leave a non-greasy finish. Plus, did we mention it’s $5 off on Amazon? Order now, and have it delivered tomorrow with Prime One-Day Shipping, or set up a recurring delivery, and save 15% after your third delivery.
