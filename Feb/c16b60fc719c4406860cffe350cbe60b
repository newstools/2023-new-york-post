The man behind the meme lives quite well. Seth Phillips, the content creator better known for being the face of the 8 million follower-strong Dude With Sign Instagram account, has offered up an inside look at his New York home. From Caleb Simpson — the influencer who brought the internet a guy who lives in an ambulance, a former laundromat now in use as a one-bedroom home, a tour of a $3,000-a-month unit that a woman shares with her pet possum and a look inside a “Shark Tank” investor’s penthouse — now comes a peek into the residence of the man who regularly goes viral for holding up clever cardboard messages. “I feel like I’m being ganged up on,” says Phillips at the beginning of the video, ironically holding a sign that says “Stop letting vloggers into your home,” as Simpson and seemingly random members of the public wonder how much he pays for rent. Simpson then takes a visit to Phillips’ sunny apartment, which he admits to paying just under $6,000 a month for. The location is not disclosed. Detail highlights include a basketball in use as a planter, an NBA Jam arcade game that Phillips notes he finds “perfect for, like, in between calls or something,” a pre-set chess board and a closet full of his buzzy cardboard signs. “This closet has, like, a billion likes,” Simpson says of the viral content storage space. Indeed, since Phillips and Jerry Media’s Elliot Tebele (of @f***jerry fame) first began the cardboard sign shtick in October 2019, the concept has taken off online and on street corners. Other standout tour moments include Simpson calling out Phillips for the amount of empty shelves in one wall unit (“You literally have nothing on the shelves up there. That’s where you think, right?”), Phillips admitting he doesn’t “cook at all,” and Simpson rating his bed 9 out of 10 in terms of comfort level. “Your apartment kind of feels like the movie ‘Big,’” Simpson summed up at the end regarding the apartment’s general vibe.
