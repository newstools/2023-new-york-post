Jackson Mahomes has not stopped celebrating the Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory over the Eagles on Sunday. This time, it was with two unexpected guests — a mechanical bull and a half-clothed woman. On Thursday night, the 22-year-old younger brother of two-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted a TikTok video of him riding a mechanical bull with a woman dressed in cowboy boots and bottom-less jeans. The TikTok star captioned the video, “about last nightttt” with the “Excuse me bruh” sound from the movie “Zoolander.” The cringe-worthy social moments only continue from Mahomes and many made that known in the comments. “Give it a break bruh,” one user said. “Extremely rare Jackson w,” another said. The younger Mahomes has had his share of social media controversies in the past. In 2021, he was accused of having a sense of entitlement when trying to get a table for a large party at a local Kansas City cocktail bar. He was also criticized for busting a few dance moves on the field during the Washington Commanders’ ceremony to honor late safety Sean Taylor in 2021. As his brother Patrick Mahomes has grown significantly in popularity inside and outside of the NFL, Jackson has amassed 1.1 million TikTok followers. He attended the Super Bowl and the title parade on Wednesday. He posted bathroom mirror selfies in a suite at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona during the big game and celebrated with his family at the parade, posting a multitude of photos and TikTok videos. Even though it’s almost a week out from the Super Bowl, it seems Jackson’s content will not slow down. He has posted 12 TikTok videos and five Instagram posts surrounding the eventful week.
