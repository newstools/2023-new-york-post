Hackers broke into the online broadcast of the Iranian president’s speech Saturday as he warned the country’s “deceived youth” — many of whom have been protesting the country’s hardline ways for months — to repent. President Ebrahim Raisi, who was marking the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, claimed Iran’s younger generation would be pardoned by Iran’s supreme leader if they showed remorse. But during the online broadcast of the live address from Tehran’s Azadi Square, the logo of an anti-Iranian government group called “Edalat Ali” appeared and a voice called out: “Death to the Islamic Republic.” Protests have erupted across Iran since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September after she was taken into custody by the country’s morality police. The government has also cracked down hard on the protesters. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty, covering many prisoners including some arrested in recent anti-government protests. On the eve of the anniversary Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations. People chanted “Allahu Akbar!’ or “God is Greatest!” But many could also be heard shouting “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the Islamic Republic” on videos posted on social media. “People have realized that the enemy’s problem is not woman, life, or freedom,” Raisi said in his speech, referring to the protesters’ signature slogan. “Rather, they want to take our independence,” he said.
