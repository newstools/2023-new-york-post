Four young kids and two adults were struck when an e-bike rider fired a gel blaster gun in Brooklyn late Sunday, authorities said. The children – 2, 6, 7 and 9 – were with their mom and another adult outside the Gateway Center mall in East New York around 10 p.m. when two people rolled by an e-bike, cops and police sources said. The passenger opened fire, striking all six victims with gel pellets, police said. None of the victims were seriously hurt and no one was hospitalized. It’s unclear if they were targeted. No arrests had been made by Monday morning.
