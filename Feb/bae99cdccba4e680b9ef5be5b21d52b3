For all The Squad’s noise about defunding the police, most of its members use private security and even call the cops when their own safety feels threatened. But only Rep. Cori Bush actually hired her boyfriend (her “partner” since before she took office, per her own staff) as security. Actually, he’s now her husband, which only compounds the ethical questions about paying him with campaign funds. (House ethics rules say “Campaign funds are not to be used to enhance a Member’s lifestyle, or to pay a Member’s personal obligations.”) Then again, Rep. Ilhan Omar’s campaign basically funded her hubby’s political-consulting business with nearly $3 million in payments, while now-Rep. Jamaal Bowman paid himself almost $30k in salary from campaign funds while running for office — but let’s stick to the security issue. With Bush leading the pack ($500k over two years), Squad members (including Omar, Bowman, Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) collectively love to use a lot of private security. We wouldn’t begrudge that — high-profile politicians regularly get death threats. But what about their constituents who have security needs? What about the small business that faces constant shoplifting because of soft-on-crime policies? What about the grandmother living in a bad neighborhood, who Bush believes shouldn’t call the cops if there’s a drug deal on her porch? These lockstep lefties all insist that every dollar removed from any police budget is a win for social justice. In other words, the only people who deserve to be safe are those with access to the funds to pay for it. And apparently if you can direct the payment to a friend or loved one, it’s even more progressive? This Democratic Socialism stuff isn’t as easy as it looks.
