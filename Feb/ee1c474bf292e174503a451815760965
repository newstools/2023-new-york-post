Not Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts, or Justin Herbert. The seventh receiver on the New York Giants depth chart received a bet to win the 2023 NFL MVP award. The modest wager that came in on Caesars Sportsbook is a mere $2 and would net $2,000 if Kenny Golladay were to win the award this upcoming season. Golladay will likely be a cap casualty for the Giants as he is the NFL’s highest-paid, non-injured reserve player, having played only 261 total snaps in 2022 and with just six catches. He is entering the third year of a four-year, $72 million deal that former Giants general manager Dave Gettleman dished out in 2021. His contract is non-guaranteed in the last year (2024) and only partially guaranteed in 2023. The Giants stand to save $6.7 million against the salary cap by cutting him loose this offseason. From there, Golladay would have the opportunity to resurrect his career on a new team. Perhaps a fresh start would be precisely what he needs to get his career back on track – though one imagines it would take a lot more than that to contend for the MVP. At the start of the season, Golladay infamously questioned first-year head coach Brian Daboll, saying, “I came here to play” last September. He would still only play sparingly despite a litany of injuries to the Giants’ receiving corps this past season, mainly acting as a run blocker. As for this wager, your $2 are better spent on a Whopper Jr.
