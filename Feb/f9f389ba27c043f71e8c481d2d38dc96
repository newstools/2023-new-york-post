A day after Brett Favre filed lawsuits against Pat McAfee, Shannon Sharpe, and Mississippi state auditor Shad White, alleging each of defaming him in public discussions about the misspending of welfare money, McAfee hit back at the former Packers quarterback. “I’m getting sued by Brett Favre,” McAfee, a former All-Pro punter for the Colts, said on his show on Friday. “I’m getting sued alongside Shannon Sharpe and an auditor from Mississippi by Brett f–king Favre. Brett Favre’s suing me in a defamation lawsuit, saying I defamed his name to try to earn a profit.” Favre’s lawsuit details McAfee calling Favre a “thief” who was “stealing from poor people in Mississippi.” Favre claimed these words by McAfee to be “outrageous falsehoods.” McAfee was dismissive of the lawsuit in his nearly 5-minute long rant then shared details on Favre’s lawyers who allegedly sent him two letters with a list of demands. “First letter was, ‘We would like you to go back and erase every single video that has Brett Favre’s name mentioned in it from your YouTube library, your Twitter library and everything else,’” he said. “So I looked at that and said, ‘That is hilarious! Of course we’re not doing that.’ “Then a few days later, ‘You have until Wednesday, this Super Bowl week, 8:30 p.m. ET to issue a public apology to Brett Favre and erase all of the video in your catalog that involves Brett Favre’s name.” McAfee said during a November episode of his show that Favre “tied the hands of poor people and took money right out of their pockets,” adding at the time that Favre had also denied the allegations. “A lot of people are wondering how my lawyers are gonna handle this,” McAfee said about the lawsuit. “You know it, I ain’t got ’em. So let’s ride this f–ker. I’m excited to see how it goes. I’ll see you in court pal.”
