It’s a rather quiet night in the Association with just three NBA games tonight, but each game looks like it could be a competitive matchup. The Chicago Bulls host the Milwaukee Bucks to start the evening. This will be a back-to-back for Chicago after playing in Indiana last night, while Milwaukee comes in rested with an 11-game winning streak. We stay in the Midwest for the second game of the night when the Minnesota Timberwolves host the Washington Wizards. Minnesota (31-29) and Washington (27-30) are both in the play-in mix right now, so this game will be important to move into the top six spots. Thursday’s action comes to a close in the desert when the Phoenix Suns play the Los Angeles Clippers. Fans won’t get to see Kevin Durant suit up in purple and orange, but Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard should all take the floor tonight. If one of these games stands out to you, use the bet365 bonus code NYP365 to get $200 in bet credits with just a $1 wager!
