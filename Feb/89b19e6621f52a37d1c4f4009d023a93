We’re a sucker for a deal. And when the Jonas Brothers play Las Vegas’ Dolby Live at Park MGM on Feb. 17, Feb. 18 and Feb. 19, we’re happy to report there are deals aplenty. Over the course of those three nights, Kevin, Joe and Nick have tickets going for their “Live In Vegas” mini-residency going for as low as $59 before fees on Vivid Seats. That’s cheaper than a filet mignon at Park MGM’s Bavette’s Steakhouse and Bar and roughly the same price as 4-5 hands of blackjack at any casino. In fact, tickets to see the Jonas Brothers live might be the best deal in all of Las Vegas this February. Especially considering the group mixes up their set list every night. So, if you want to see the trio live ahead of the release of their seventh studio album “The Album” in May at their only scheduled shows of the year thus far, we’ve got everything you need to know below.  Although there are only three gigs on the JoBros’ calendar, we want to give you all the details you need from show start times to ticket prices.

Last year, the Jonas Brothers played three back-to-back-to-back shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM from Nov. 10-12. Each night, they played different songs — they didn’t even repeat their opening track. On Nov. 10, the Jonas Brothers kicked things off with “Fly With Me,” “Rollercoaster” and “What A Man Gotta Do.” The next evening, “Leave Before You Love Me,” “Only Human” and “That’s Just the Way We Roll” set to the tone. They closed their short run of shows by beginning with “Strangers,” ‘Only Human” and “Lonely” on Nov. 12.
