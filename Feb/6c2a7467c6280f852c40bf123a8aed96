Three people died in an early morning house fire in New York’s Hudson Valley on Thursday, authorities said. The home on Highland Avenue in the Village of Monroe was engulfed in flames just before 1 a.m., the Monroe Police Department said in a statement. Neighbors told responding officers the residents were likely still inside the burning home – but officers could not enter “due to the heavy fire conditions,” police said. Firefighters immediately worked to extinguish the fire and then begin rescue efforts, which led to the discovery of three victims who died in the flames, authorities said. Their names were not immediately released. Local police detectives are working with Orange County fire investigators, the local medical examiner’s office and the Monroe Joint Fire District to determine the cause of the blaze. No additional information is immediately available.
