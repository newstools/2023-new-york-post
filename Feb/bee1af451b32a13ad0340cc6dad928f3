Gracie Hunt got her wish. The daughter of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt celebrated Kansas City’s Super Bowl 2023 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, when she made her way down to the field at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, to join her family for the postgame festivities. “We just won the Super Bowl!” the 23-year-old Hunt exclaimed in an Instagram Story. In a separate post, Hunt — a former Miss Kansas USA — can be seen holding the Lombardi Trophy, which the Chiefs won for the second time in four seasons. “It shines bright like a diamond!” Hunt posted on Instagram. “God is so so good—thank you Jesus!” Prior to kickoff on Sunday, Hunt had been giving fans an inside look at her experience at the big game, where she posed on the sidelines. Leading up to Super Bowl 2023, Hunt told The Post that she was hopeful the Chiefs could finish the season just as they started. “We’re excited to hopefully finish our season with a win in Arizona just like we started it with a win in Arizona,” she said, referencing the Chiefs’ Week 1 victory over the Cardinals. Sunday’s championship win closes out what’s been a wild week for Hunt, who announced Thursday she’s covering the March/April 2023 issue of Maxim magazine. “I’ve always admired the many strong, smart, successful women featured in Maxim. They have inspired me in the fearless pursuit of their careers & dreams which makes this cover so meaningful to me. It still feels surreal!” Gracie gushed on Instagram, to which her mother replied, “Living BIG girl! Chase your dreams!”
