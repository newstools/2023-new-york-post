He can teach old dogs new record-breaking tricks. A German dog trainer earned the world record for most dogs in a conga line when his 14 canines arranged themselves into the dance formation with his help. Wolfgang Lauenburger accomplished the impressive feat in Stuckenbrock back in August, according to Guinness World Records. The record-breaking dogs were Bibi, Cathy, Charly, Elvis, Emma, Filou, Fin, Jennifer, Katie, Maya, Simon, Speck, Susy, and Ulf. He beat out his own daughter, Alexa, who has appeared on “Britain’s Got Talent” and held the previous record of nine dogs. Lauenburger has set multiple world records including most skips by a dog on hind legs in 30 seconds and most rollovers by a dog in one minute.
