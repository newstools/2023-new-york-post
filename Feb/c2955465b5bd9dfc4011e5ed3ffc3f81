Tom Brady’s recent underwear snap certainly made its way around the NFL community. On Monday, the newly retired quarterback posted a photo of himself in his briefs in response to a playful bet he made back in June. Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill was among the many to react to the post, likening the 45-year-old Brady to a certain controversial wideout. “Tom done retired and turned into AB ,” Hill tweeted in reference to Antonio Brown. Antonio Brown last played for the Buccaneers, where he was teammates with Brady. Brown infamously ended his time in Tampa after shedding his game-day apparel and running off the field shirtless midway through a contest against the Jets in January 2022. In recent months, Brown has taken social media shots at Brady, who reportedly welcomed the receiver into his home after he joined the Buccaneers in 2020. Weeks before Brady confirmed he and Gisele Bündchen were divorcing after 13 years of marriage, Brown posted a photo of himself and the 42-year-old supermodel on Instagram that showed the twosome embracing following the Buccaneers’ Super Bowl win in February 2021. “Put that S–t On,” Brown captioned the post in October. Later that month, Brown made waves over his decision to sell merchandise that featured Brady’s ex-wife. Brady is now focused on his next chapter after announcing last Wednesday that he’s retiring from football after 23 seasons. Bündchen, who shares son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10, with Brady, told the seven-time Super Bowl champ on Instagram, “Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life.” The new chapter for Brady will include his 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports, where he’ll become their lead NFL analyst in the fall of 2024.
