Taking a dip in the middle of cooking — or eating — dinner has never been easier. For anyone who’s fantasized about swimming laps from the convenience of their kitchen, dining room or even the living room — this over-the-top mansion is a dream come true. Just outside of Las Vegas, at the edge of the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area, a sprawling estate has hit the market for $14.5 million, with the unique feature of a centrally accessible pool. “The most striking features of the home are the two raised infinity-edged saltwater pools that seamlessly blur the distinction between the living spaces, water and natural desert elements,” Douglas Elliman agent Kristen Routh-Silberman told The Post of the Henderson, Nevada compound. “You can literally step into the pool from the great room — it’s truly special.” Built in 2020, the approximately 9,500-square-foot property is futuristic: There is nary a curved line to be found, the surfaces range from matte to shiny gray, and the indoor blends seamlessly with the outdoors. “The property is designed to combine space and light creating a dramatic and sensational home that takes your breath away,” said Routh-Silberman of the commitment to straight edges and a grayscale palette. “Its unique layout presents a series of angles that open to peaceful spaces and continuous lines of sight.” In addition to the ubiquitous pool, the palatial residence also boasts an inside-outside office, a bar and media room, a billiards room, a gym and a “wine tasting lounge.” There’s additionally an elevator, a swim-up outdoor BBQ kitchen and bar, a hibachi grill, four fireplaces and a separate catering kitchen. The primary bedroom features two closets. There is also smart-home technology, surround sound and security throughout. While the dual pool is arguably gimmicky, the horizon-spanning views of the city and mountains are most certainly not.
