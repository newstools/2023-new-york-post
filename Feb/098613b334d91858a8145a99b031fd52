LeBron James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Tuesday night to become the NBA’s All-time leading scorer. James, who scored 38 points in the Lakers’ 133-130 loss to the Thunder, now has 38,390 points. Abdul-Jabbar is second with 38,387 points.The momentous feat brought out platitudes from all around the NBA community on social media. Chief among them was Magic Johnson, a teammate of the legendary Abdul-Jabbar on the “Showtime” Lakers of the 1980s. “This historic moment is so special because we will never see another LeBron James,” Johnson tweeted. “He’s always been a pass-first leader whose ability to make his teammates better is one-of-a-kind; which makes his breaking the record even more incredible!” Some of the NBA’s current stars were left in awe, as well. “Congrats @KingJames …legendary stuff right there,” Warriors superstar Stephen Curry posted on Twitter with a saluting emoji. “#38388” “38388 and counting… congratulations @KingJames!!” Suns guard Chris Paul added. And of course, the some of the previous generation’s most active Twitter analysts chimed in, as well. “Honor to say I had a chance to match up with The GaoT,” Paul Pierce wrote in the aftermath of the record falling. “I’ve alway never acknowledged u as King but u Truly the King #lRespect no player in NBA History had the pressure coming in the league to exceed expectations not only have u live up to it but u have surpassed it #allhailtheKing” If there’s a debate to be had on James’ place in the game, Kendrick Perkins was among those not having it Tuesday night. “I don’t wanna hear sh-t!,” Perkins wrote. “I’m not debating a damn thing when it comes to the GOAT. Old heads, haters, trolls… sit this one out! I always believed but now it’s concrete and nothing left to discuss… Carry. The. Hell. ON!  Congratulations my brother @KingJames.
