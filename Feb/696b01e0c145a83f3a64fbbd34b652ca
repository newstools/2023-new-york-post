An unsuspecting gun-toting chump was busted in the act when he flashed his loaded weapon inside a Bronx deli right next to two plainclothes NYPD cops, new video shows. Video obtained by The Post shows the petite hoodie-wearing suspect – identified by police as Martin Mateo, 28 – displaying the black .22 caliber revolver and waving it around inside the bodega on Southern Boulevard near East 149th Street around 4:40 a.m. Feb 10. Meanwhile, the two plainclothes cops stand on either side of the suspect, one drinking coffee and the other looking at his phone. But as the gunman makes his way for the exit, the officers jump into action and rush the 5-foot-5, 120-pound gunman — pressing him against the glass door and putting his hands behind his back. One of the officers is then shown pushing the suspect against the counter — where an employee is tending to a customer — and placing him in handcuffs. The gun Mateo held was loaded with three rounds of live ammunition in the cylinder, according to a criminal complaint. Each round is a metal casing topped with a metal projectile. Mateo claimed he found the gun but never fired it, according to the court document. “Yeah, I had the gun,” he reportedly said. “I found it four days ago and held onto it. I didn’t use it or buy it.” Mateo has since been arraigned on weapons possession charges, as well as reckless endangerment and possession of ammunition, according to a criminal complaint. He was ordered held on $20,000 cash bail and $100,000 bond or $100,000 partially secured bond at 10 percent. His next court date is set for March 7. Mateo has three open arrests — one on a federal conspiracy charge from February of 2018, and two assault raps — one from April of 2017 and the other from November of 2011, cops said.
