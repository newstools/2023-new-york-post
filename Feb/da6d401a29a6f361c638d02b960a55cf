He’s hopelessly devoted to her. John Travolta, 68, honored his late “Grease” co-star Olivia Newton-John by teaming up with “Scrubs” actor Zach Braff, 47, and Donald Faison, 48, to sing the show’s iconic song “Summer Nights” for a T-Mobile Super Bowl ad. In the commercial, Travolta can be seen wearing a Danny Zuko-esque outfit including a white T-shirt and black jacket while the trio touts T-Mobile’s service while using tweaked lyrics and “Grease”- style dance moves that pay homage to the 1978 movie. Travolta’s co-star Newton-John died in August of 2022 after a three-decade-long battle with breast cancer. “My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again,” wrote the “Saturday Night Fever” star on Instagram after her passing. “Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John!” “One Direction” alum Harry Styles dressed as Travolta’s character to sing a cover of the song “Hopelessly Devoted to You” during a performance on Halloween. The song was covered by Pink in tribute to Newton-John during the American Music Awards last fall. The cultural impact of “Grease” still resonates since the movie danced its way into theaters decades ago. It was also announced that a prequel series called “Rise of the Pink Ladies” is coming to Paramount+.
