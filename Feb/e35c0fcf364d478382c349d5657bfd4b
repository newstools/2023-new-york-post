Love me, love me — do you want to buy me? A two-family New York City townhouse owned by Nina Persson — the lead singer of Sweden’s famed rock band The Cardigans, of “Lovefool” fame — and her husband, Nathan Larson, has hit the market for $3.5 million, The Post has learned. Located in East Harlem, at 1989 Madison Ave., Persson purchased the six-bedroom, four-bathroom home in 2007 for $2 million, records show. Known as The Harlem House, it’s currently rented by one family. Unit 1 includes a two-bedroom duplex that can be transformed into a three-bedroom, with two bathrooms. It also includes access to the basement with three storage units, a washer/dryer and a fitness area, the listing notes. Unit 2 includes a private stoop entrance and features three bedrooms with high ceilings. Occupying more than 4,200 square feet, with an additional 700 square feet of outdoor space, the home has seen a gut renovation in the past few years. Aptly described as a “Scandinavian farmhouse” vibe — after all, the home graced the cover of Swedish Elle Décor in 2014 — images show white-painted brick walls, herringbone floors and a kitchen with a tile backsplash. Elsewhere, there’s non-painted exposed brick walls and a claw-foot bath tub. The original staircase has been restored and there are two kitchens with marble countertops. Additionally, the primary bedroom boasts a terrace. “The Cardigans,” for many millennials a nostalgic group, are most known for that notable 1996 hit, “Lovefool,” which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1996 film “Romeo + Juliet,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song was also featured on “Beverly Hills, 90210” and the 1999 film “Cruel Intentions.” The song is even having a moment now, being featured in the commercial trailer for the new Pamela Anderson Netflix documentary — which premiered on Tuesday. The Cardigans have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Gino Filippone of Corcoran and Spencer Means of Compass hold the listing.
