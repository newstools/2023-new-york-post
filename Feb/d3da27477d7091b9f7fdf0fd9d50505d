Manny Machado didn’t mask his intentions when speaking with reporters Friday morning: The Padres’ star third baseman plans to opt out following the 2023 season. Machado, who has been with San Diego for the last four seasons, added that he thinks the Padres know “where I stand with my situation.” “That’s a lot of money out there,” Machado said. “That’s a lot of money out there. These owners are making a lot of money, and we’re bringing a lot of money too. We’re having fun out there, we’re having a good time and we’re filling up the seats. “It’s all business, and these are things that happen. Markets change. From when I signed five years ago, it’s changed tremendously. Things change and evolve, and as a player, it’s pretty good to see.” It doesn’t mean, however, the Padres will let him reach free agency without a strong effort to retain him. The Post’s Jon Heyman previously reported the Padres were aiming to finalize a deal with Machado before he opted out — talking to Machado’s camp and hoping to keep the 30-year-old in a city where he has thrived since signing a 10-year, $300 million contract as a free agent in 2019. But if Machado follows through on activating the opt-out clause in his deal, he would be abandoning $150 million — $30 million per year over the next five seasons — and would enter a free-agency marketplace that has produced massive contracts recently. Machado and the Padres could agree to an altered deal, but he didn’t elaborate on any talks that have, or haven’t, started between the two sides. “I mean, so far this year, I’m a Padre, but who knows after next year,” Machado told reporters. Machado finished second in the MVP voting last year, hitting .298 with 32 home runs, 102 RBIs and an OPS of .898.
