A deep-pocketed Little Monster can live large like Lady Gaga in her former Central Park South penthouse rental, which is back on the market for a cool $35,000 a month. The 1,985-square-foot duplex, at 40 Central Park South, comes with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and stunning park views — along with 750 square feet of outdoor space. There’s even a “doggie run with a fake fire hydrant” still in place on the terrace that the star singer and actress installed for her French bulldogs, says listing broker Merav Shalhon, director of Essential New York — part of ATCO Properties, the building’s owner. (In December, a man who shot and wounded Gaga’s dog walker while stealing her French bulldogs — Asia, Koji and Gustav — in 2021, took a plea deal and was sentenced to 21 years in prison.) A private staircase leads to a landing that opens into the trophy home. The entry foyer heads to a sunken living room with a woodburning fireplace and panoramic views overlooking the park. There’s also a dining room with its own balcony. Stairs lead to a main bedroom suite with another woodburning fireplace and stunning views, plus a marble ensuite bath and a walk-in closet. Two terraces flank the bedroom. The unit also has another two decks for private outdoor space. Gaga lived here from around 2013 to 2017 and the penthouse was “heavily featured” in her 2017 documentary, “Gaga: Five Foot Two,” according to the brokers, who add that the unit has “celebrity lineage.” The building was formerly home to Lance Armstrong, Rod Stewart, “A Chorus Line” creator Michael Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Rod Stewart Johnny Cash, and Loretta Young. These days, the celeb tenant is TV personality Keith Olbermann, sources dish. As for Lady Gaga, she has moved on and recently shared a photo of herself in character along with Joaquin Phoenix in the upcoming “Joker” sequel, “Joker: Folie à Deux.”
