In a naked power grab, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is neutering the nation’s National Electoral Institute, basically turning out the lights on remotely free or fair elections. The country’s Senate voted 72-50 on party lines Wednesday to “reform” the institute, known as the NIE for its initials in Spanish. The law basically pulls trained independents out of the nation’s hundreds of polling places, effectively restoring pre-’90s presidential control of the voting and vote-counting processes. This will allow AMLO to effectively pick the governors of Mexico’s states and a pawn as his own successor. And, since he’s declared a truce with the cartels, they’ll continue to rule much of the nation. In other words, conditions to our nation’s south will soon be pushing millions more to flee across the border. AMLO failed last year in a bid to do this via constitutional amendment; if the opposition manages to get Mexico’s Supreme Court to strike down the new law, he’ll try again some other way. President Joe Biden and his party, and their huge media cheering section, have been raging for two years about threats to democracy in our country. Too bad they’ve ignored the far larger threat next door.
