TAMPA — Aaron Boone, as a bit of a throwaway line, mentioned last week that he could “get a little creative” in finding ways to play Giancarlo Stanton in right field at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees manager did not elaborate. But The Post has learned what Boone is at least considering — namely playing Aaron Judge in left many of the games in which Stanton plays right. Boone would only say he is “open” to a variety of concepts. But he already has broached this possibility with Judge. Boone has conceded that Stanton again will be the primary designated hitter. But to gain flexibility and use the DH spot to rest the body, but not the bat of others, Boone would like to use Stanton in the field on occasion. The preference would be to do it in right field at Yankee Stadium, which is not spacious. But then what to do with Judge if he is not the DH in those games? Boone has not ruled out playing Harrison Bader in the large left field of Yankee Stadium, with Judge in center. For now, though, Boone is leaning toward an alignment on occasion that would have Judge in left, Bader in center and Stanton in right. How much this occurs is certainly a large question. Stanton started 72 games in the outfield in 2018, his first year with the Yankees. He has started just 77 in the four seasons since — the most in one year was 38 last season. “My hope is that the outfield is very much in play [for Stanton],” Boone said. If Stanton is a legitimate outfield option, Boone will trust in Judge’s flexibility and willingness, two items that helped last year when he became the primary center fielder for the first time in the majors. Judge has played 5,409 ²/₃ innings in the outfield — none in left field.
