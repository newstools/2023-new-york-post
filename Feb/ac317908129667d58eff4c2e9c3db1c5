Hugh Hudson, the British director of the Oscar-winning 1981 film “Chariots of Fire” has died. He was 86. His family said in a statement Friday that Hudson died at the Charing Cross Hospital in London following a “short illness,” according to the BBC. The Post has reached out to a rep for Hudson for comment. Actor Nigel Havers, who starred in the acclaimed drama, also issued a statement, saying he was “beyond devastated” by Hudson’s death. “‘Chariots of Fire’ was one of the greatest experiences of my professional life, and, like so many others, I owe much of what followed to him. I shall miss him greatly,” Havers reportedly wrote. The film won Best Picture, Original Score, Writing, and Costume Design at the 1982 Academy Awards. It also came in at No. 19 in the British Film Institute’s list of Top 100 British films. Born in London in 1936, Hudson started his career by making documentaries and television commercials, including the British Airways face advertisement in 1989. His documentaries include “Fangio: Una vita a 300 all’ora,” “Lumière and Company” and “Rupture: Living With My Broken Brain.” Hudson’s other film credits include “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan,” “Revolution,” and “I Dreamed of Africa.” He co-wrote his final project “Tiger’s Nest” with Rupert Thomson, which premiered last year. He is survived by his wife Maryam D’Abo, as well as his first wife, Sue Michie, and their son, Thomas.
