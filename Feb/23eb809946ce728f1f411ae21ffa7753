A teen who was reported missing from his Brooklyn home this week was found dead the next day on freight train tracks — shot in the head with severe burns, cops said Friday. Deandre Matthews, 19, had not been seen since he left his home on East 56th Street near Linden Boulevard in East Flatbush around 5:45 p.m. Monday, authorities said. Less than 24 hours later, police found Matthews with “significant burn wounds through his body” and a gunshot wound to the head, lying on freight train tracks about three miles away on Nostrand Avenue — steps from the Brooklyn College campus, cops said. Matthews, who also showed signs of smoke inhalation, was pronounced dead at the scene. Cops confirmed Friday that his death had been ruled a homicide. The circumstances leading up to his death were not immediately known, and no arrests had been made by Friday morning.
