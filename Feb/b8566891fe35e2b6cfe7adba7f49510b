Do you love Costco in bulk? If so, this new drop from their very own Kirkland Signature brand has your name all over it — and Costco’s name, too. You may know Kirkland from their vodka (is it a dupe for Grey Goose?) or their bulk snacks, abundant samples or even their bestselling product — Kirkland brand toilet paper. Now, brand loyalists and Costco shoppers nationwide can represent their favorite wholesale warehouse, with stylish loungewear. The collection was found in-store and posted on TikTok, featuring hoodies, sweatpants and even leggings with both Costco and Kirkland logos emblazoned on them. Now, you can order these items online, with or without a Costco membership. Want to get this Costco drip for yourself? Act fast, as many of the viral sweatshirt designs are sold out. We tracked down what you can buy night now, and found resale hoodies so you don’t miss out on this wholesale wardrobe trend no one saw coming. Represent Kirkland Signature in style with this crewneck sweatshirt. The top is a unisex style for all fans to enjoy and comes in white, gray and black with a smaller Kirkland logo on the upper right corner. The sweatshirt that started all the internet hype may be sold out at Costco, but we found it on Ebay for sale right now. The black sweatshirt features the Kirkland logo across the chest and currently comes in an array of sizes while supplies last. If you love all the things Costco sells, get a hoodie that represents everything they have to offer. The all-over Costco print crewneck is still on sale, available in gray in unisex sizing. Jog over to Costco quick to get one of the last pairs of these pants. The black style is sold out, but you can still get the gray pair now. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
