Damar Hamlin will play football again. That’s according to Dr. Thom Mayer, medical director for the NFL Players Association, who told SiriusXM’s “Heart to Heart” that he expects the Bills safety, who went into cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field in a game against the Bengals just over a month ago, to be able to return to the NFL. “I don’t want to get into HIPAA issues, but I guarantee you that Damar Hamlin will play professional football again,” Mayer said Wednesday. It marks the first time that it has been suggested that Hamlin, who has not addressed a possible return, would be able to play again since the horrifying incident on Jan. 2 when the 24-year-old collapsed following a routine tackle on Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins. Following the play, Hamlin stood up then suddenly fell to the turf. CPR was administered on the field and he was rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Hamlin was eventually released on Jan. 9 in order to continue his treatment closer to home at Buffalo General Medical Center before being discharged from there on Jan. 11. The second-year pro was also in attendance for the Bills’ final game of the season in Buffalo, a divisional-round loss on Jan. 22 to the Bengals. On Wednesday in Phoenix, Hamlin was given the Alan Page Community Award by the NFLPA for his service to the community. The award recognizes a player who goes above and beyond to perform community service in his team’s home city and/or hometown. “One of my favorite quotes: It’s a blessing to be a blessing,” Hamlin said while accepting the award with his parents beside him. “With that being said, I plan to never take this position for granted and always have an urgent approach to making a difference in the community where I come from and also communities across the world.” Hamlin had a toy drive fundraiser in which donations poured in for following his collapse, with the charity having raised more than $9 million to date.
