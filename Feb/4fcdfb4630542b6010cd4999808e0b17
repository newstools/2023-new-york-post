This owl wanted to get even wiser. A college library in Decatur, Georgia, had to close for a week after an owl made its home there, WSB-TV reported. The brazen creature flew in through the chimney of Agnes Scott College’s McCain Library and settled in its rafters. To safeguard both the students and the animals, the private women’s liberal arts college shuttered the main floor of the library. They also hired a professional falconer, who tried to shoo the owl away with a long stick, hoping it would exit through an open door. A trap containing a pigeon and a gerbil as bait was also installed to catch the bird. The owl was finally captured and when the falconer released it, it flew to a tree nearby. This was not the first bird to enroll at the college of approximately 1,000 students. “This is our fourth bird,” the library’s director Elizabeth Bagley said. “First owl, but the fourth bird to come down the chimney. It’s been fun in some ways, but we’d like our library and study space back at some point.”
