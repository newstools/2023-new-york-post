When Kansas and Baylor faced off earlier this season, the Bears won by six points in a game they nearly led wire-to-wire. Kansas, though, has won five of six since and are favored to win this weekend’s rematch at Allen Fieldhouse. With football officially over, it’s time to focus your energy on College Basketball.

For all of the intrigue ahead of this top-10 clash, there’s really one big question looming over it all: Which Kansas team will we see on Saturday? Will we see the one that lost to Baylor on Jan. 23, capping off a three-game losing streak that threatened to derail the Jayhawks’ hopes of an eventual No. 1 seed? Or the one that’s been hot since, including two blowout wins on the road over Oklahoma (23 points) and Oklahoma State (11 points), to maintain their perch atop the Big-12? Now they return home to Allen Fieldhouse, where Kansas has won 18 of its last 19 games and is 304-17 all-time under Bill Self (94.7%). Yes, that 23-point loss to TCU – which came two days before the Baylor loss – is a serious blemish, but that win over Texas on Feb. 6 was impressive and signals that this team might be just fine, after all. I’m also skeptical of Baylor’s road resume, which includes just seven true road games in 26 games overall. The Bears haven’t exactly impressed in those contests. The Bears lost three of them outright, while their four wins have come by a combined 18 points – and none in an environment as hostile as this one. When these teams met in late January, Kansas shot 5-of-19 from deep (26.3%) and committed 15 turnovers, which were both uncharacteristic for an offense that ranks among the best in the country. While Baylor’s defense deserves some credit there, I’m betting on the Jayhawks to come alive in front of their home crowd in a much-anticipated revenge spot.
