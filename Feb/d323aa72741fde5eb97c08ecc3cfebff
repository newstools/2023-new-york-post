The average person believes websites will become obsolete in the next decade. A recent survey of 2,000 U.S. adults discovered seven in 10 (70%) believe apps are gradually replacing websites. With people relying on their phones for absolutely everything, it’s no surprise more than one in four (26%) think they can go a year without using a standard computer browser. While 69% use their smartphone daily, only 44% report using their desktop or laptop with the same frequency. Forty-six percent have even done a full day’s work entirely from their smartphone, and 42% have used it to file a tax return. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Cricket Wireless for their Tax Time initiative, the survey also found that if forced to choose between a smartphone and a computer, 59% would opt for their phone. Thirty-six percent think they could only go less than a day without their smartphone. iOS users proved to be rather resilient, with 34% claiming they can survive phoneless for a week compared to 21% of Android users. While entertainment (67%) and communication (66%) apps rank among the most common, more respondents have a finance app on their smartphone (59%) than those who have news/magazine apps (28%). “From work to play, our research shows people are embracing the convenience of apps in all areas of life,” said Tony Mokry, Vice President & Chief Marketing Officer for Cricket Wireless. “Apps can also be a great way to try out alternative services before committing.” More than half of respondents (52%) rely on software or apps to file their taxes, compared to 36% who do them by hand. Interestingly, only two in five (40%) anticipate getting a tax refund in 2023, with the average person expecting about $2,338. Those expecting a refund plan to put it toward a mobile wallet (25%), deposit it in a traditional checking or savings account (25%) and add it to an investing app (23%). “There are many ways to get the most out of your refund, such as by upgrading your phone and wireless provider simultaneously,” Mokry added.
