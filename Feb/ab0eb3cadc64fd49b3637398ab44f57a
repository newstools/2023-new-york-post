The pitch clock violation era is upon us. Padres star Manny Machado was the first player to violate the new rule in a trial run on Friday while facing the Mariners in a spring training game. The San Diego infielder was hit with a strike because he wasn’t set and facing the pitcher, Seattle’s Robbie Ray, in the batter’s box when the pitch clock ticked to 8 seconds. Machado was officially hit with the violation by plate umpire Ryan Blaney pointing to his wrist and saying “0-1” to call the new count. Machado then hit a single on the next pitch. “Ah, man,” Machado said in an interview with Bally Sports after the game. “I mean, I’m about to make a big adjustment. I might be 0-1 down a lot, a lot this year, man. It’s super-fast. It’s definitely an adjustment period, it’s going to be. I’m going down in the history books!” With MLB wanting to cut down how long games take, commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters he hopes the vast amount of changes for the upcoming season will help make the game shorter and more action-oriented. The pitch clock violation was initially tested out in the minor leagues last season and contributed to a cut in game time by 25 minutes, according to ESPN. Already it appears to be having an impact at the major league level, too. According to ESPN’s Jeff Passan, the Padres-Mariners game took just 2 hours, 29 minutes. He also noted that the Rangers-Royals game was over after 2 hours, 33 minutes. Besides the eight-second pitch clock violation, pitchers are also affected: They will have 15 seconds to throw when the bases are empty and 20 seconds when there’s a runner on base. If a pitcher doesn’t throw in time, hitters will receive an automatic ball in their count. The MLB also enacted other changes, including banning defensive shifts and using larger bases.
