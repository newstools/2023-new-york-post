Derek Jeter is joining the media. Jeter will be a studio analyst for Fox Sports beginning this season, the network announced during its Super Bowl 2023 pregame show. It had Fox’s Alex Rodriguez in for a segment with Michael Strahan and Curt Menefee when Jeter arrived on set. Jeter has been more active in media since leaving the Marlins as CEO. He appeared one night on Fox’s pregame show during the World Series last year. The Post has previously reported that YES was interested in bringing in Jeter to call some Yankees games. Jeter has developed a strong relationship with ESPN after he served as an executive producer on the documentary about his career, but it made no offers for game or studio work, according to a source. Jeter’s expanding media portfolio could still include more ESPN projects. Jeter, 48, is a Hall of Famer and one of the most iconic players of all-time. As the Yankees captain, he was available to talk for interviews, but rarely said anything of significance. Fox’s pregame is less about analysis and more about goofing around. Jeter is pretty good at the one-line jabs so he could fit it. He will be teamed on the set with A-Rod, David Ortiz, Frank Thomas and host Kevin Burkhardt. Jeter and Rodriguez were longtime frenemies during their playing days, but the ice has melted post-retirement. Jeter is likely only going to be at big events, like the All-Star game, the playoffs and the World Series. It is doubtful you will see him working FS1’s pre-games.
