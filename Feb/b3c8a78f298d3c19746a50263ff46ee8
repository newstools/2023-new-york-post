The Chinese spy balloon soaring over the southern United States may be shot down once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, according to a report. The US military may attempt to destroy the craft once it is safely away from land — but still in American territorial waters — then retrieve it for examination, a senior US official told ABC News. A large swath of airspace will likely be shut down to protect civilian aircraft before the operation begins, the official said.
