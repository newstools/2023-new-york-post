It’s still early, but the Rangers look very much like a team that can potentially win a Stanley Cup. There is still work to be done, but Vladimir Tarasenko provided the jolt this team they needed. First game and scoring the first goal in the first few minutes? Could not have asked for a better start to his Rangers career. While Vladdy is here, Vitali may be on the move. Kravtsov has requested a trade. Will the Rangers move him? What could they get for him in a trade? That’s the big topic of discussion this week on a new episode of “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Mollie Walker, Larry Brooks and me.
