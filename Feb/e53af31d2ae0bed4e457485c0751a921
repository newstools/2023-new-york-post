The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is eye-balling this artificial tear brand closely. The CDC has urged several doctors and patients to stop using EzriCare Artificial Tears as it has been linked to 50 bacteria-resistant infections and one death in 11 states, according to a report. Most of the people infected said they used artificial tears, with EzriCare being the most reported brand. EzriCare drops are preservative-free and don’t have any ingredients that prevent bacterial infections from occurring. “CDC recommends that clinicians and patients immediately discontinue the use of EzriCare Artificial Tears until the epidemiological investigation and laboratory analyses are complete,” said the report. The CDC tested open bottles of EzriCare and found Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria that were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics as well as the antibiotics ceftazidime and cefepime. The CDC is testing the bacteria to see if it matches the infection strain in the reported infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacteria that is usually spread in health care settings and is also commonly found in soil and water, according to the CDC. Testing of unopened bottles is ongoing. EzriCare, which is based in New Jersey, issued a statement last week saying that it was not being forced to recall any of the drops nor did it receive any consumer reports. “EzriCare became aware in the last few days that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is conducting an ongoing investigation related to adverse events implicating various Over the Counter (OTC) eye drops,” reads the statement. “EzriCare has received no consumer complaints or adverse event report related to the investigation to date, also, as of this date, EzriCare has not received communication from any regulatory agency providing any outcomes or details to EzriCare about the ongoing investigation. “We have not been asked to conduct a recall. EzriCare does not manufacture the Lubricant Eye Drops,” continues the statement. “Nevertheless, and in an abundance of caution, EzriCare recommends that during this evolving situation you discontinue use of any portions of EzriCare Artificial Tears Lubricant Eye Drops you may have until we can discover more details about any potential safety concerns.”
