Another season, another strange injury for Aroldis Chapman. Chapman, now with the Royals, slipped and fell in his home on Saturday, cracking a tooth and splitting his lip which required stitches, according to MLB.com. It appears the left-hander will avoid any missed time and is still expected to throw a bullpen session on Tuesday. Chapman’s unique start to his Royals tenure comes after a rough ending to his time with the Yankees. The 34-year-old posted a career-worst 4.46 ERA and 1.43 WHIP over 36 ¹/₃ innings in 43 appearances in The Bronx last season. He also spent time on the IL with a leg infection caused by a tattoo. With a playoff roster spot far from guaranteed, Chapman did not show up for a team workout before the ALDS which signaled the end of his career in pinstripes. Spring training may reveal where Chapman will fit in the Royals’ bullpen after joining the team on a one-year $3.75 million deal in January. He is expected to compete with Scott Barlow for the closer’s role. Chapman spent seven years in The Bronx after signing a five-year, $86 million contract with the Yankees in 2016, at the time the largest contract ever for a relief pitcher. Following his 2.21 ERA and sixth All-Star season in 2019, the Yankees extended his contract at an additional $18 million. The 2016 World Series champ during a brief stop with the Cubs could set himself up for one more lavish multiyear deal if he can rediscover the form that made him one of the more feared closers in baseball. Chapman’s contract in Kansas City could also increase to a total of $8.75 million depending on games finished and other performance markers. Chapman broke into the big leagues at 22 years old with the Reds in 2010, where he spent six years and made the All Star team four times.
