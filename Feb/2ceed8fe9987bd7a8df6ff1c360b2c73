The convenience of an Apple Watch is a little undercut if you have to keep a bulky charger with you. Instead of carrying around a cable and wireless connector for your watch, you could just power it with your keychain. The Apple Watch Wireless Keychain is your way to always have a backup charger with you for your Apple Watch. Normally, this little charger would cost $49, but you can get it for $18.99. This compact device looks like a key fob and acts like a wireless charger. The Keychain Charger is compatible with every series of Apple Watch. If you’re still using an older Apple Watch, that means you can recharge when the older battery starts getting low. The largest Apple Watch battery yet belongs to the Apple Watch Series 8 Ultra with 542mAh. Fully charged, your keychain charger can hold up to 950mAh, so you should have plenty of power for a full recharge. Just pop your device onto the magnetic ring to start charging. When the watch is attached, you can check the four LEDs above it to see the charging status. One user writes, “I left for work in the morning and realized I forgot to charge my watch at night. By the time I made it to work, this charger had my watch at 50%! What a lifesaver!” Even if your keychain runs out of power, you may still be able to charge your watch. Just plug it into a Micro-USB cable and AC adapter and use it like any regular wired Apple Watch charger. Make sure you can use your favorite wearable all day.
