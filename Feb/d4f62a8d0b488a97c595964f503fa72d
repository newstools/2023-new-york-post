It will never let go. The re-release of “Titanic” was unsinkable at the box office, earning $2.72 million on its opening night Friday, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. The James Cameron-helmed epic is projected to cruise into a $15 million domestic weekend, according to Forbes. Paramount brought the 1998 Oscar winner back in 4K 3D to celebrate its 25th anniversary. Prior to the re-release, Titanic was eighth on the all-time top box office list. It beat out “80 for Brady” which still scored big with $1.85 million in sales. The sports comedy’s success was “a gamble” according to Screenrant, since it attracts seniors, women and football fans — demographics that haven’t been top movie customers post-pandemic. “Avatar: The Way of Water” —  the second Cameron-directed film to lead the Friday box office — remained in third place this week with close to $1.7 million in sales. The M. Night Shyamalan thriller “Knock at the Cabin,” which was in second place last Friday, slipped down to fourth, with a $1.69 million take. The apocalyptic psychological horror flick is based on the 2018 novel “The Cabin at the End of the World” by Paul Tremblay. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” remained in fifth, and took home $1.3 million.
