A retired NYPD cop died in a fire that broke out inside his Brooklyn apartment building Monday, authorities said. Joseph Newkirk, 76, was found unconscious inside the building on Union Street near Rochester Avenue in Crown Heights where the blaze broke out just before 2 p.m., police and fire officials said. The septuagenarian, who retired from the department in 1979, was pronounced dead by first responders. The fire erupted on the third floor of the six-story building and was placed under control within about 40 minutes, the FDNY said. A dozen FDNY units, including 60 fire and EMS members, responded to the scene. No one else was hurt. The cause of the fire remained under investigation Tuesday morning.
