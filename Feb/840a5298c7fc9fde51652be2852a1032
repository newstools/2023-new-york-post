“Let’s treat each other with respect.” That was President Joe Biden’s message to Republicans coming out of Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast, after he delivered remarks such as, “In our politics and in our lives, we too often see each other as opponents and not competitors. We see each other as enemies, not neighbors.” Fine words, but we couldn’t help thinking back to his inauguration. “Let’s start afresh, all of us. Let’s begin to listen to one another again,” he pleaded then. “Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a path to total war.” He followed those words with two years of ramming through Democrats’ big-spending agenda over all GOP opposition and with no negotiation. Plus tons of demagoguery, like the “Jim Crow 2.0” canard about Georgia’s voting law (which black voters proved to love). Maybe apologize for that, Joe, if you want anyone to believe you now. Then there was that speech last year warning that “Democracy is on the ballot” and a vote for Republicans was “un-American.” What Biden really means by this “respect” speech is that he can act as dictatorial as he wants, but once Republicans have a little bit of power — and can properly investigate Hunter Biden’s influence-selling and the president’s complete failure at the border — suddenly civility should be king. Watch the press buy it hook, line and sinker. To liberal reporters, Biden’s dismissal of the opposition in his first two years was perfectly acceptable. And any GOP investigation today is an awful, norm-breaking horror. It’s ridiculous. Spare us your fake pieties, Mr. President. Your definition of “respect” is “let me do whatever I want.” It isn’t rude to oppose your failures; it’s respecting the American people.
