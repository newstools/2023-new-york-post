LeBron James had a response lined up. James was shown on the jumbotron during Super Bowl 2023 between the Chiefs and Eagles, and got booed by the crowd at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. Never one to take affront lying down, James made a gesture of putting an imaginary crown on his head — in symbolism with his nickname, King James. The 38-year-old James passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer earlier this week in a Lakers home game against the Thunder. Abdul Jabbar’s previous record was 38,387 points, and the record had stood since he retired from basketball in 1989. “Just want to say thank you to the Laker faithful, you guys are one of a kind,” James told the Lakers crowd Tuesday night. “To be in the presence of a legend and one of the greatest such as Kareem is humbling. Give a standing ovation to the captain, please. Everybody that’s ever been a part of this run for the last 20 years, I just want to say thank you. … F–k man… thank you guys!” James has missed the Lakers’ last two games since the record-setting performance, with an ankle injury. The Lakers are set to play the Blazers on Monday in their last game before the NBA All-Star Break.
