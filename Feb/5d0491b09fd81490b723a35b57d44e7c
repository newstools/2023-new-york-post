Things got a little cheeky between Prince William and Kate Middleton during the 2023 BAFTAs. While walking the red carpet together, Middleton was caught giving her husband a little tap on the behind, in a video captured by Vogue as they arrived to the awards show. She smiled as the two walked side-by-side. In the caption, the outlet joked that the Prince and Princess were “just like us”–describing them as “a regular husband and wife that sometimes like to cop a feel.” Middleton donned a gorgeous, one-shouldered white gown by Alexander McQueen, complete with a pair of black evening gloves. She actually wore the dress during the 2019 BAFTAs, but restyled it for this year’s ceremony, according to The Daily Mail. Prince William wore a black tuxedo with a black velvet jacket and a black bowtie. Their arrival marks the duo’s first time at the BAFTAs since 2020. Prince William has been the president of the association since 2010. The royal couple missed the 2021 BAFTA awards due to the passing of Prince Phillip, who died just one day before the scheduled ceremony. Last year, they were unable to attend due to “diary constraints,” a rep told Variety at the time. This year’s event took place at the Royal Festival Hall in Southbank, London, a change from the usual Royal Albert Hall. This is one of the couple’s first big public appearances following the release of William’s brother, Prince Harry’s, bombshell memoir, “Spare.” In the tell-all, Harry alleged that his brother pushed him to the ground and physically “attacked” him in November 2019, while they argued about him and Meghan Markle’s relationship with the press and ongoing royal duties. The two have not made any public statements about the Duke of Sussexs’ claims.
