“Everything Everywhere All at Once” stars Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan and their other cast members were big winners — and the movie broke a big record — at the 2023 SAG Awards on Sunday night. Their out-there multiverse flick swept four of the top film awards, including Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, along with individual acting awards for Yeoh, Curtis and Quan. Their collection of victories means that “Everything Everywhere All at Once” also reached a historic high point: It received the most SAG Award wins ever for a film, a representative for the organization confirmed to The Post. “The Whale” star Brendan Fraser, meanwhile, nabbed the prize for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for what he called the “role of my life” playing a despondent 600-pound man — a part that controversially meant wearing prosthetics to mimic his character’s larger frame. The 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards, live from LA’s Fairmont Century Plaza, made a shift away from longtime previous broadcasters TNT and TBS and instead streamed on Netflix’s YouTube channel. The ceremony honors both television and film and is a dependable predictor of how the winds will blow at the 2023 Oscars next month. Below is the full list of the night’s winners, along with some highlights.
