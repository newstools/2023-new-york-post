Go team — of one! A high school cheerleader from Nebraska may not have been on top of any pyramids when her entire squad quit before the state championship, but she did earn the respect of everyone there by competing solo. Katrina Kohel, a senior at Morrill High School in Morrill, Nebraska, was told just two weeks before the Nebraska State High School Cheer and Dance Championships that her three teammates would not be able to attend the competition due to personal reasons. Her coach gave her the option of still attending the three-day event, either to watch or compete solo. That’s when she mustered up the spirit and said bring it on. “I decided I wanted to go and still compete because I wanted to end my senior year with a bang, and I didn’t want to give up on cheerleading because it has been such a huge part of my life,” Kohel told Fox News. The solo cheerleader took to the mat to perform her new routine, saying she had the loudest audience there — and even her competitors were cheering her on. A video of the performance shows Kohel holding up signs, waving her pom-poms and chanting loudly. Overall, Kohel said performing the solo routine was an “amazing feeling.” “I probably had the loudest crowd involvement there,” Kohel told the Omaha World-Herald. “Everybody was cheering with me, and it was an amazing feeling.” The solo cheerleader ended up scoring eighth out of 12 groups, which is the highest her team had placed in three years. Her team, the Morrill Lions, said in a Facebook post the are proud of Kohel’s willingness to still compete and her dedication to the team. “Her jumps were soaring through the air and her school spirit was contagious,” the post read. “Congrats Katrina, on a job well done! Everyone is so proud of you.”
