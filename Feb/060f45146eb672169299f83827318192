Olivia Dunne is sending TikTok into a tizzy once again. LSU’s superstar gymnast posted a playful clip Tuesday to the viral video platform, where she boasts 7.2 million followers, joking about a “boyfriend reveal.” In the clip, which has been viewed more than 4 million times as of Wednesday, Dunne is first seen stretching her arms out while looking away from the camera. Moments later, she transitions into a dance before moving out of the frame solo. The 20-year-old also wrote in the video’s caption, “He’s just a little shy I swear.” Dunne’s video from Tuesday comes a week after the New Jersey native — who is one of the most influential college athletes — posted a curious message for Valentine’s Day. In a post shared on Instagram, Dunne can be seen sitting on a bench by herself while holding a bouquet of red roses. “He loves me…he loves me not,” she wrote on Feb. 14. Dunne also filmed a Valentine’s-centric video for TikTok, where she mouthed the words, “If you want to make out with me, just ask.” Though Dunne has long been feeling the love from her fans, she’s encountered the occasional online troll, too. Over the weekend, Dunne shut down a critic who made a lewd comment about her physical appearance, according to Outkick. “I’m an athlete. I’m not perfect but I’m happy with how I look. I am blessed enough to have a healthy body that’s capable of doing amazing things:),” she reportedly replied. Dunne and her LSU teammate are currently ranked No. 8 and will compete against Alabama on Friday.
