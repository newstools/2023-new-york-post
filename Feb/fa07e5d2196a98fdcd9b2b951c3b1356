North American Aerospace Defense Command is watching one or two new airborne objects that could be additional spy balloons nearing American airspace. Three security sources told Canada’s Global News Saturday that the unidentified objects were being monitored by NORAD, the joint US-Canada military response team that oversees the continent’s air defenses. The sources did not say where the objects had been spotted, or whether they would be intercepted by the US or Canadian military.
