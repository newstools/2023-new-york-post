Two of the most interesting young teams in the NBA face off Friday night when the Cleveland Cavaliers play the New Orleans Pelicans in the Big Easy. The Pelicans have won three in a row to get to 29-27 and are very much in the thick of the Western Conference play-in race. They were much higher in the standings earlier in the season, but the temporary loss of Zion Williamson clearly affected them. Still, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram have done a good job filling in. After acquiring Donovan Mitchell in the offseason, Cleveland has been sitting pretty. The Cavaliers have hovered around the four or five spot in the Eastern Conference standings and enter tonightâ€™s game at 35-22. Mitchell is leading the way with 26.8 points per game, while Darius Garland, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen have done a good job in the starting lineup. The FanDuel promo code is one of the best on the market and Cavaliers vs. Pelicans is a good chance to try it out. 21 or older.
