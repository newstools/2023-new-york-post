Eric Bieniemy is leaving Kansas City without a head coaching job. The Washington Commanders hosted Bieniemy on Friday and are finalizing a deal to secure him as their new offensive coordinator, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported. Bieniemy has been with the Chiefs organization since 2013. He served as running backs coach before taking the offensive coordinator title in 2018 — the same year Patrick Mahomes became the starter. Since he’s taken over, the Chiefs’ offense has been the most feared in the NFL. They’ve also made five straight AFC Championship games, have three Super Bowl appearances and two championships in that time. One would think that a résumé like that is enough to get any job in the NFL. He’s interviewed for numerous head coaching positions over the years — including one with the Colts in January — but has yet to land a job. ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith weighed in on why Bieniemy has been unable to land the head position, pointing to Andy Reid as the possible reason. “He made sure we knew he called plays,” Smith said. “In Kansas City, it’s convoluted. One minute it’s Eric Bieniemy, another minute it’s Andy Reid… If you give owners a choice to give credit to somebody, who the hell do you think they’re gonna give credit to? They’re going to give credit to Andy Reid.” Leaving the Chiefs gives Bieniemy the power to run the offense under Commanders head coach Ron Rivera. “If you’re wondering why would he go from Chiefs OC to Commanders OC, he was not the key play caller,” Rapoport tweeted. “Now in Washington, for a defensive-minded head coach, he would be the sole play caller. It would potentially put him in better position, not that he needed it, to be a head coach.” Chiefs quarterbacks coach Matt Nagy is the favorite to take Bieniemy’s place as Kansas City’s offensive coordinator.
