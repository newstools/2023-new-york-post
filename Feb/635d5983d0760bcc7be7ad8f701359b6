 A Russian rocket blitz injured five people in the middle of Ukraine’s second-biggest city Sunday. The attacks struck an apartment complex and an education building in Kharkiv, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. Four people were maimed after an S-300 missile landed in a residential area, and another was injured when a missile hit the National Academy for Urban Economy building, less than a half mile from the city’s central square. In rocket attacks in the eastern contested Donetsk region, five civilians were wounded in the city of Druzhkivka and town of Avdiivka and its outskirts, Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. The region is one of four areas of Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed last year after holding sham elections. However, occupying forces are still not in full control of the heavily populated province. In the port city of Odesa, workers raced to restore electricity in the wake of a large-scale network failure over the weekend. Temporary generators were shipped in to try to restore electricity after repeated Russian strikes on the energy grid. Some 280,000 customers remained in the dark Sunday afternoon, and utility officials warned they should prepare for lengthy blackouts. Meanwhile, European allies on Sunday imposed a ban on Russian diesel fuel and other refined oil products in a move to reduce war profits. The embargo came with a price cap, but allowed exports to continue to flow to India and China to avoid worldwide price hikes. As Moscow’s unprovoked invasion nears its anniversary, Ukraine’s defense minister was optimistic that Western leaders would supply the country with warplanes to fight off Russia ahead of the grim milestone.
