The federal government slapped Mars Wrigley with a $14,500 fine after two contractors fell into a vat of chocolate at a factory operated by the multibillion-dollar confectionary conglomerate. The two workers fell waist-deep into a tank full of chocolate at a factory in Elizabethtown, Pa., last June. Rescue workers cut a hole in the bottom of the tank to free them. The trapped workers were taken to a local hospital, where they were treated for minor injuries, WHIP-TV reported. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency in charge of making sure companies comply with workplace safety regulations, cited Mars Wrigley for failing to provide the contractors with the proper safety training, the Associated Press reported. The Post has sought comment from Mars Wrigley. A company representative told reporters last week that the safety of workers and outside contractors “is a top priority for our business.” “As always, we appreciate OSHA’s collaborative approach to working with us to conduct the after-action review,“ the representative said. Mars produces some of the most iconic treats, including M&M’s, Snickers and Skittles. It’s unclear what brand was connected to the incident.
