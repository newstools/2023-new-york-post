Jessica Chastain pulled a Jennifer Lawrence. The “George and Tammy” actress, 45, fell while walking up the steps at the SAG Awards, moments after she was announced a winner. Several cameras caught the unfortunate moment Chastain tripped on her taffeta Zuhair Murad dress. The actress said she was flustered about the tumble. “I’m a little embarrassed I tripped on the stairs — but I had two very handsome men helping me up” — one of whom was Paul Mescal! — “so that wasn’t so bad,” she told People magazine. “I’m just so over the moon and happy and I can’t believe it.” “I am the one who never expects this is going to happen,” she told ET. “Yeah, I fell on the stairs, that’s good because some people didn’t know that I did.” The actress went on to blame her pink gown for nearly toppling her over. “I was trapped in my dress and I had very nice men helping me, so that was a plus,” she added. Chastain had just won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series for “George and Tammy,” beating out Niecy Nash, Amanda Seyfried, Julia Garner and Emily Blunt. “To every actor watching, I look forward to working with you. I will see you on set!” she said during her acceptance speech. Several Twitter users were quick to point out how the accident was similar to when Jennifer Lawrence fell at the 2013 Oscars. “JESSICA CHASTAIN DID THE JLAW FALL,” one user wrote. “jessica chastain said i know it’s been 10 years since jennifer lawrence fell at an award show let me fix this,” added another.
