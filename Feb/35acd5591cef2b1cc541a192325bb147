Jamie Lee Curtis never thought she’d get to the point where she’d be receiving an Oscar nomination. The scream queen was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — but she’ll never forget her humble beginnings. “I’m 64 years old. I’ve been an actor since I was 19,” she told AP Entertainment. “I made horror films and sold yogurt that makes you s—t. I never thought I would hear my name at the Oscars.’ The “Halloween” star is referring to the commercials she did for the yogurt brand Activia, a probiotic yogurt that “supports gut health.” Curtis did the commercials for seven years — and “Saturday Night Live” even did a spoof of one of her ads. She explained that the moment she was nominated, she was in “full acceptance” thanks to practices she learned in sobriety. “I’m sober 24 years in two weeks, and being sober, you live in a reality,” Curtis shared. “It’s not magical thinking, it’s not a fantasy life. This is my real life, and I am not the determiner of that happening. I have to accept what happens.” “And so I was in full acceptance in that moment and was shocked, shocked, and then thrilled,” she exclaimed.
