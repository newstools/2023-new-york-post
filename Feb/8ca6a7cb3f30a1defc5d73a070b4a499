Sam Smith and Kim Petras did not slay their Grammy Awards performance of “Unholy” on Sunday, according to Elon Musk. The Twitter CEO took to his platform to liken the devilish act to an apocalypse, tweeting: “End of days vibes” under a clip of the duo. “If that’s satan, we have nothing to worry about,” he added. Smith donned red leather and a hat with protruding horns for the show, while Petras danced in a cage as fire shot from the stage. The performance sparked outrage online, with conservatives calling it “devil worshiping.” “This…is…evil,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted, with Megyn Kelly blasting the act on her SiriusXM daily podcast “The Megyn Kelly Show” as “celebrating Satan.” Fans of the duo, both 30, were quick to clap back, with one user writing on social media: “If Sam Smith were thin, cis, and straight, they wouldn’t be ridiculed for how they present and dress.” The singer, who identifies as non-binary, and Petras, who transitioned to female as a teenager, made music history Sunday as the first non-binary and transgender artists to take home Grammys gold in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category. “I’m the first transgender woman to win this award,” said an emotional Petras, clad in crimson. “I want to thank all the incredible transgender legends before me who kicked these doors open.”
