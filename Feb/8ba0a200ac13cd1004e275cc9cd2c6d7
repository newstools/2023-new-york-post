Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Thursday: Anthony Volpe smacked a few balls hard during live batting practice, against Jimmy Cordero, James Norwood and Ian Hamilton, that likely would have been hits to right field, center field and left field, respectively. Lefty relief prospect Lisandro Santos watched infielder Andres Chaparro slam his first pitch of the session for a home run to left field. Aaron Judge danced his way off first base with an aggressive lead, trying to mess with lefty Matt Krook during live BP. Judge stole 16 bases last season and, along with everyone else because of the adjusted rules, could run more this year. The Yankees will hold their final workout before the Grapefruit League begins Saturday.
