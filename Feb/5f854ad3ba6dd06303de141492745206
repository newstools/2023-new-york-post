Québec last week avoided a blackout, despite the frigid Arctic cold snap, by importing electricity from New York. But it may be out of luck next time, along with the Empire State itself, thanks to the green rush to kill reliable sources of power. Cuomo-Hochul policies under the Climate Leadership and Protection Act, enforced by the state Climate Action Council, mandate that 70% of New York’s power come from renewables by 2030 and 100% by 2040. As a result, New York’s rapidly losing reliable carbon-based generating capacity — which leaves insufficient backup for when solar or wind plants can’t deliver. In other words, the state’s electric grid is growing ever more unreliable — even as the state is also pushing for far greater reliance on electric heat. The official CLPA plan, as the Empire Center’s James Hanley notes, is for backup to be provided by “DEFRs — dispatchable emissions-free resources.” Those are clean-power backup sources — but no such thing exists yet. Yes, Hydro-Québec has agreed to supply the Big Apple with 1,250 megawatts of clean electricity. But Hanley points out the deal “does not obligate Hydro-Québec to provide power in winter.” California’s brownouts last year are a glimpse of the green-energy nightmare awaiting New York. This madness also guarantees soaring electric bills even when the lights are on, as wind and solar still cost more than traditional power generation. New York deserves a realistic energy plan before it’s too late.
