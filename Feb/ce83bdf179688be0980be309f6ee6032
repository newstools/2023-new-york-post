Following a groundbreaking trade for superstar Kevin Durant from the Nets, the Phoenix Suns are eyeing up another New York player to fill a ball-handler role. The NBA market is scarce when it comes to point guards at the moment, but the Suns are on the hunt for someone who will gel well with Chris Paul and Cameron Payne, according to Bleacher Report. That someone might be Derrick Rose of the Knicks. The franchise has been monitoring Rose, per multiple sources. The former MVP has been left out of the Knicks rotation as head coach Tom Thibodeau opts for a younger rotation. New York recently acquired Josh Hart, a 27-year-old defensive-minded guard who was acquired for Cam Reddish from the Portland Trailblazers. Meanwhile, Rose hasn’t been in action in a game since the team’s 108-88 win against the Houston Rockets on Dec. 31. A buyout for Rose is not likely but is also not completely out the door, per the report. Prior to falling out of the lineup, Rose was averaging 5.8 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. He is making $14.5 million this season and has a team option of $15.6 million for the 2023-2024 season. Over his 15-year career, Rose spent eight years with the Bulls and transcended into a top player in the league before knee injuries altered his career. He morphed into a premier role player, with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Minnesota Timberwolves and Detroit Pistons. In his four seasons in New York — counting one sole season in 2016-17 — Rose has recorded an average of 14.2 points and 3.8 rebounds per game, along with a field goal percentage of 46.4.
