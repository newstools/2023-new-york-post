Your morning routine is important, but there’s always going to be one element that stands out among the rest. No matter what order you shower, eat, and pick out your outfit, one item is indisputably essential: your morning cup of coffee. This week, start your day with a little more pep in your step with huge savings on this handsome, hefty espresso machine from Breville, now priced down 20% off on Amazon. Ditch your daily cup of boring black drip, and wake up feeling like you’re vacationing at your Sicilian palazzo with Breville’s Barista Express Espresso Machine. Your friends and houseguests will think you robbed the $10-a-cup coffee place down the street, but you’ll know better: you scored this great deal, all on your own, no funny business, on Amazon. Treat yourself, or a special someone, to a barista-grade coffee from the comfort of your home kitchen. Breville proudly packs the “four key elements” of café-quality coffee into every cup their machine makes: “rich, full flavor, perfectly balanced taste, irresistible body, and a velvety mouthfeel.” Save $150 on mouthfeel this week with the Breville Barista Espresso Machine, now just $600 on Amazon. In less than a minute, you can enjoy café-quality espresso at your very own kitchen island, all without having to talking to that snooty barista. Choose between automatic and manual controls, and a variety of interchangeable filters, then let Breville do its thing. Don’t talk to us before we’ve had our Breville.
