The Beyhive is buzzing like never before. After much speculation, Beyoncé has officially announced her highly anticipated stadium “Renaissance Tour.” Seven years after her “Formation Tour” and five years after the “On The Run II Tour” with her husband Jay Z, the 28-time Grammy winner (and 88-time nominee!) will embark on her solo headlining “Renaissance Tour” in support of her critically acclaimed chart-topping 2022 album “Renaissance” all summer long. The international tour will start overseas in Sweden, Belgium, the U.K., France and Germany in May before she returns to North America for 29 huge stadium concerts starting July 12 at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field. And although Queen Bey isn’t coming to the Big Apple on the run — as of now — she will get close to the City That Never Sleeps. On July 29 and July 30, Mrs. Knowles is set to touch down at East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium for two huge back-to-back concerts. She’s familiar with the venue too. The last show of her “Formation Tour” was at the Giants and Jets’ home stadium on Oct. 7, 2016. That time around, she brought Jay Z and Kendrick Lamar onstage with her. Who will she bring this time? Will she sing the same songs she did at her recent Dubai concert? All we know is the best way to find out is live. Want to see live music this year?

At the time of publication, Beyoncé does not have any opening acts lined up for her 2023 “Renaissance Tour” although there are rumors that 74-year-old singer Grace Jones will be joining her swirling on Twitter. We personally can’t get enough of her seven-minute cover of Roxy Music’s “Love Is the Drug.” In 2016, she was joined by DJ Khaled on the “Formation Tour.” Two years later, she co-headlined with her husband and fellow 88-time Grammy nominee Jay Z on the “On The Run II Tour.” Although Beyoncé didn’t perform any tracks from her 2022 record “Renaissance” at the Jan. 23 concert in Dubai, she was able to cram in several hits from her expansive catalogue as well as a few covers into her 17-song set. Here’s her set list (courtesy of SetList.FM): 01.) “At Last” (Harry Warren cover; made famous by Etta James) 02.) “XO” (from her 2014 album “Beyonce”) 03.) “Flaws And All” (from her 2007 album “B’Day”) 04.) “Ava Maria” (from her 2008 album “I Am Sasha Fierce”) 05.) “Halo” (from her 2008 album “I Am Sasha Fierce”) 06.) “Brown Skin Girl” featuring Blue Ivy Carter (from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 07.) “Be Alive” (from the 2021 “King Richard” soundtrack) 08.) “Otherside” (from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 09.) “Bigger” from the 2019 “Lion King: The Gift”) 10.) “Spirit” from the 2019 “Lion King Soundtrack”) 11.) “Freedom” (from her 2016 album “Lemonade”) 12.) “I Care” (from her 2011 album “4”) 13.) “Beautiful Liar” (from her 2007 album “B’Day”) 14.) “Crazy In Love” (from her 2003 album “Dangerously In Love”) 15.) “Countdown” (from her 2011 album “4”) 16.) “Naughty Girl” (from her 2003 album “Dangerously In Love”) 17.) “Drunk In Love” (from her 2014 album “Beyonce”) Knowles’ “Renaissance” was the most critically-acclaimed album of 2022 showing up on countless year-end lists as 2022’s best. The 16-track album, clocking in at just a little over an hour was also extremely popular with fans as well quickly charting at number on the Billboard 200, making it Beyoncé’s seventh album to hit the top spot. However, the record that brought the world “Break My Soul” may have more to it. Beyoncé has hinted that the record is part of a three-part series; in a June 28, 2022 announcement she called it “Act I.” Since the album’s release, it has undergone a few transformations. According to Pitchfork, Beyoncé “replaced ableist lyrics in “Heated,” and removed an interpolation of Kelis’ “Milkshake” on “Energy” after Kelis said she was not informed by Beyoncé and her team that her music was going to be used on the new album.” She also reportedly dropped Honey Dijon and Madonna remixes of “Break My Soul.” Beyonce’s seventh studio album “Renaissance,” netted nine Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Dance/Electronic Recording, Best Dance/Electronic Album, Best R&B Performance, Best Traditional R&B Performance, Best R&B Song and Best Song Written For Visual Media. The nine nominations tie Beyonce with her husband Jay Z for most all-time Grammy nominations with 88 apiece. While a Beyoncé tour announcement may trump all others in terms of hype, there quite a few exciting tours to look out for in the next few months. Here are just five of our favorite, can’t miss concerts that may be coming to a city near you soon. • Taylor Swift • Madonna • Adele • Janet Jackson • Lizzo
