Former Detroit Lions cornerback Stanley Wilson Jr. died after collapsing at Metropolitan State Hospital in Los Angeles County earlier this month, according to TMZ. He was 40 years old. Wilson — who is the son of former Bengals running back Stanley Wilson Sr. — was reportedly transferred to the medical facility on Feb. 1, after he was in police custody in county jail due to a vandalism arrest in August. Wilson was arrested after he allegedly broke into a Hollywood Hills home, took a bath in an outdoor fountain and raided the property, TMZ reported at the time. Wilson was declared incompetent to stand trial, according to prosecutors, resulting in his transfer to Metropolitan State Hospital, which specializes in mental health care. Wilson was a third-round draft pick by the Lions in 2005. He played two seasons with Detroit before suffering a career-ending Achilles tear in a preseason game against the Giants in 2008. Wilson recorded a career 89 total tackles, eight pass deflections and one forced fumble. The former NFL player collapsed and died during intake at the medical facility, law enforcement sources told the outlet. A cause of death was not disclosed, and autopsy results are pending toxicology. Foul play is reportedly not suspected. Wilson has an arrest history of home invasions dating back to 2016, after his playing career ended. In June 2016, Wilson was shot in the abdomen during an attempted break-in at a home in Southwest Portland while allegedly naked. He was charged with attempted burglary. In January 2017, Wilson was arrested again in Portland for allegedly walking around a neighborhood naked. He was arrested a third time in February 2017 for breaking into another home while naked. Wilson played four seasons on the Stanford Cardinal football team from 2001 to 2004. It’s unclear if Wilson was married or had children.
