With one Alderson on his way out of the Mets’ front office, another has left altogether. Assistant general manager Bryn Alderson is no longer with the organization, the Mets confirmed to The Post’s Joel Sherman on Thursday. The club said it would have no comment on the personnel decision, which was first reported by SNY. Alderson, the son of outgoing team president Sandy Alderson, had been one of three assistant GMs, along with Ian Levin and Ben Zauzmer. Bryn Alderson and Levin were promoted to that role in the summer of 2021 under then-acting GM Zack Scott while Zauzmer landed his promotion under current GM Billy Eppler in December 2021. Alderson came to the Mets from the Athletics in 2011 – a year after his dad took over as the club’s GM – as a pro scout before becoming the assistant director and then director of pro scouting. The Mets announced in September that Sandy Alderson would step down as the team’s president as soon as it found his successor, a process that remains ongoing. He had returned to the franchise in 2020 to serve as president under owner Steve Cohen, though at times he had to step back in to run baseball operations when the Mets fired Jared Porter and Scott. Bryn Alderson and Levin also took on more responsibilities when Scott was placed on administrative leave late in the 2021 season. News of Bryn Alderson’s departure comes the same week in which The Post reported that former Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran will join the front office to work under Eppler.
