Deals on things you don’t need are nice. Because new things are great. And it’s a real treat to own special things. AirPods Pro at their lowest price since Black Friday? That’s nice. Your go-to eye restoration cream from CeraVe at 35% off? That’s nice, too. $10 off a vinyl copy of Harry Styles’ Grammy-certified Album of the Year “Harry’s House” on Amazon? Love it. What’s really, really nice, though? Deals on essentials. Deals on items that you can’t live without. Like, for example, 25% off on this Graco 4Ever 4-in-1 car seat on Amazon. Even nicer is how many years of use you’ll get out of the Graco. Designed to last 10 years, the Graco 4Ever DLX 4-in-1 seat can transform from a rear-facing harness, to a forward facing harness, to a high-back booster, to a simple, backless booster.
