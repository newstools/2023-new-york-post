The city Department of Transportation struck out on this one. Big Apple DOT officials botched a Queens road sign for the Jackie Robinson Parkway, misspelling the color-barrier-busting baseball Hall of Famer’s name. The sign at Myrtle Avenue and Forest Park Drive features a likeness of the Brooklyn Dodgers’ great — atop the words “Jakie Robinson Parkway.” “It’s embarrassing,” Glendale native Kira Incantalupo told The Post on Sunday. “Poor Jackie Robinson. “That shouldn’t have happened,” said Incantalupo, 37. “I mean, nobody wants to have that. It’s a memorial for somebody. It should be corrected.” Local resident Quana Martin, 32, found the typo disrespectful. “I just feel it’s a little odd because how do you not know how to spell his name? He’s a well-known figure.” Queens teen JP Ward had a harsher take. “It’s f–king stupid,” the 17-year-old said. “I wouldn’t say it’s disrespectful, but it’s definitely stupid.” Robinson became the first black ball player in Major League Baseball when he was called up by the Dodgers in 1947, breaking the sport’s decades-old color barrier. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, a decade before his death. “This spelling mistake is absurd,” City Councilman Robert Holden added of the road-sign typo on Sunday. “You don’t have a few eyes looking at these signs? DOT is a mess. “This is a slap in the face. Jackie Robinson means a lot to me,” the pol added. “I was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan!” Notified of the botched road sign Sunday, red-faced New York City DOT officials said the gaffe would be fixed “immediately.” “That’s just government,” Queens waitress Aurora Terranova told The Post. “Most of the time s–t just goes wrong because of stupidity or oversightedness. “That’s really what it comes down to.”
