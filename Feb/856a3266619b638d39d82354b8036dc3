LeBron James is likely to be missing in action for an extended period of time with an injured right foot, per The Athletic. The news comes after the Lakers’ 111-108 win against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, where James suffered the injury yet continued to play and score 26 points. He is expected to be sidelined for an indefinite amount of time. His absence would come at a very inopportune time for the Lakers as they try to push for a postseason berth. Los Angeles (29-32) is sitting at 12th in the Western Conference, one game behind the Pelicans for 10th and the final spot in the play-in tournament. The Lakers have won three straight but face tough opponents ahead with the Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State Warriors, and the Dallas Mavericks again on tap. Having James potentially missing in action for an uncertain amount of time puts their playoff goal in jeopardy. James is averaging 29.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 6.9 assist this season. The 38-year-old posted a video of his foot in a cast on Monday night to his Instagram story, captioning it: ‘Fkn sucks!!!!’ James also suffered a hand injury during the All-Star game, which caused him to sit out after halftime. He scored 13 points in 14 minutes in the first two quarters, but had to leave after he appeared to jam a finger on the rim on a blocked-shot attempt in the second quarter. “I did one little chase-down block and got my finger caught in the rim, but I’ll be fine,” he said afterward. “I don’t think it’s too much to worry about, but for precautionary reasons I decided to take the rest of the night off.” James suffered a few other ailments throughout the 2022-23 season, including a knee injury and groin strain. The NBA’s all-time leading scorer said before the All-Star break that he was “not going to go too crazy,” as the following games of the regular season are “23 of the most important games of my career.”
