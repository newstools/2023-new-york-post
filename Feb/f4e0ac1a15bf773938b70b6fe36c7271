If you are a Rangers fan, you can’t escape the two words that rhyme with hat-trick pain. Chris Drury already has been busy before the March 1 trade deadline. He added Vladimir Tarasenko to score some goals. He also brought back Tyler Motte. Now everyone is wondering if that guy Patrick Kane could now realistically come to the Blueshirts. If not Kane, could the Rangers GM make another move or two in the next 10 days? We break down all the trade deadline rumors and discuss Igor Shesterkin looking human on a new episode of “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Mollie Walker and me. Our beautiful, bald ex-Ranger friend, MSG Network and NHL Network analyst, Mike Rupp, joins the show this week. MOTTE’S BACK: This was a smart deal by the Rangers that upgrades the fourth line. They didn’t have to give up too much and he was a big part of their playoff run last season. This reunion made a ton of sense. STRUGGLING SHESTERKIN: Everybody needs to relax. He has set such a high bar after his sensational performance last season. He’s just been average lately. It’s better he struggles a bit now than come playoff time. He will come out of this.
