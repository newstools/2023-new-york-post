It’s not every day you get to hit a game-winning dagger in front of the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. Bishop Montgomery’s senior guard Christopher Jones hit a clutch three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left to beat Sierra Canyon, the team LeBron James’ two sons play for on Tuesday night. Part of his celebration was to stare and point right at James while screaming in triumph. The four-time NBA champion and four-time MVP wasn’t able to do much but nod his head in respect to Jones’ passion and big-time play. “I pointed directly at LeBron and he just shook his head up and down,” Jones told the Los Angeles Daily News. “He couldn’t say nothing.” The moment went viral on TikTok as Jones shared an edit of the moment on his account with the caption “never gon forget this.” Jones didn’t score a single bucket in the first half but turned it on after halftime. He ended up with seven points in the second half, including the biggest shot of the game. “At the end of the first quarter I missed a shot just like that one coming off a down-screen,”  Jones added. “At the end, I said this is the exact same shot. I just shot it and it was just cash.”
