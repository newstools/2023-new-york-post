Yankees legend Derek Jeter revealed he turned to his teammate’s golden thong to break out of a slump he described as the “worst offensive stretch in my career.” Appearing on “The Tonight Show,” Jeter took part in a segment called True Confessions, where Jimmy Fallon and his guests are given two envelopes, one containing a true, embarrassing story and the other a false one. “I once wore a thong in public in front of thousands of people,” Jeter recited the prompt. Fallon and singer Rita Ora were tasked with interrogating Jeter to figure out if “The Captain” did in fact wear the undergarment. “It is the truth,” Jeter explained. “I’m going to ultimately regret playing this game, but let me explain.” Jeter said he had a new teammate that would have a gold thong hanging from his locker and would wear it under his uniform to reverse his misfortunes at the plate. The mystery teammate is reported to be Jason Giambi, the Yankees’ first baseman from 2002 to 2008, who has said he only wears it when “desperate to get out of a big slump.” “In 2004 I went through the worst offensive stretch in my career,” Jeter said. “Every day I’d walk in and he’d point at the thong.” Jeter was 0-for-32 at the plate before he caved. He revealed he smashed a home run on the first pitch he faced when he wore the thong against the Oakland Athletics on April 29, 2004. “The golden thong is legendary. It’s never not gotten a hit,” Giambi told NJ.com in 2015. “It was his first slump. I don’t think the guy’s ever slumped in his career. He’s unbelievable. You know, the gold thong, he had to get out of it. Jeter ended the season batting .292, with 188 hits, 78 RBIs, and 23 home runs. He received an All Star nomination, won his first Gold Glove Award and helped lead the Yankees to the ALCS.
