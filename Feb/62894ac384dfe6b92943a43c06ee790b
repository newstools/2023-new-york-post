There are some tough lessons to learn in life, and one is that you don’t always get what you want. While the debate around giving up seats on planes for kids continues to rage on, one man’s refusal to let a child cut in front of him on a Formula 1 ride has been praised by TikTokers. In a six-second TikTok clip posted by @myrightmiddletoe — which has been viewed over 9.5 million times — a man is seen making a face at the camera as he waits on line for a Formula 1 ride ahead of two young girls. The camera then pans to a sign that informs those in line that the three-minute ride — an arcade-style simulated race game — closes at 4:55 p.m., and urges potential riders to “please consider this when joining the queue.” The footage then cuts to one of the girls crying and being consoled by an adult, then to the lucky guy grinning gleefully while he sits in the car. “When they say you’re the last one able to ride today and you deny the little kid behind you asking to trade places,” the writing on the TikTok video reads. The short video is set to the audio clip of someone saying, “Girl, f–k them kids and f–k you too,” and has the caption “As soon as this happened this sound came to my mind to use.” TikTok users sprung to the defense of the F1 fanatic, some even praising him for teaching the girls a “tough” life lesson. “Kids need to know they won’t get everything all the time and it’s okay!!” one user wrote. “Character building moment,” agreed another. “Why should he trade just because she’s a kid?” another questioned. The user didn’t say where the ride was, but the sign says it costs 1 pound, meaning it was likely in England.
