LenDale White almost wasn’t there to tell the story. The former NFL running back revealed on the “I Am Athlete” podcast this week that he suffered a major heart attack in 2019 at the age of 34, and it almost ended his life. “My (left anterior descending artery) was clogged, and I had to have two stints shot into my heart so my blood can flow again,” he said. “It’s called a ‘widow-maker’ because you’re really not supposed to make it back from that.” A star at USC, White was a second-round pick by the Titans in the 2006 NFL Draft. He racked up 24 touchdowns over four seasons with Tennessee, but found himself out of the league by 2011. Earlier this month, he admitted to the Titans team website that he battled addiction and depression, and considered suicide as his career floundered. White shared his tale with some prodding from one of the podcasts hosts, his former Titans teammate Adam “Pacman” Jones. The former cornerback was one of the few people White had shared the news with, as well as ex-NFL star Chris Johnson. The 38-year-old added that he hasn’t told people about the scare because he doesn’t want their sympathy, though he has discovered an appreciation for working out. “I’ve been so scared,” he said. “When you’re 34 and you have a heart attack, that should change your life forever. The physical has to change. I definitely workout every day now — and I hate working out. “I gave dogs 1,000 yards and was smoking kush every day and never worked out, squatted, nothing. To go in there and be like, ‘I got to squat now for fun,’ it ain’t — you know. But s-t, when you want to save your life, yeah, I’m a squat all day.”
