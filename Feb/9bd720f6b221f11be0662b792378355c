A Dallas Stars fan jawed off – and got punched directly in the face. During the Stars’ 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday night, a Dallas fan got into an altercation with another attendee at American Airlines Center. The mullet-rocking Stars fan dropped the N-word, which led to him getting punched multiple times. Warning: This video contains explicit language and violence. It’s unclear how the altercation exactly started, but a video shows the Stars fan telling the other attendee, who was wearing a black polo, to “step down here and I’ll box your ass.” The other man seemed unfazed by the fighting words, which led to the Jamie Benn jersey-wearing loudmouth fan, who was white, to say: “All right then. Stay the f–k up there. Dumbass n—a.” Once the black polo-wearing fan heard those words, he socked the Dallas fan right in the jaw, sending him into the seats. The Stars fan immediately tried to retaliate, but the attendee who punched him was able to hold him off. The scuffle escalated to where a female Stars fan began attacking the polo-wearing attendee as well, but the two were quickly held off by onlookers who came in to intervene. The Stars fan who initially started the fight was eventually pinned down, and he was called a “little boy” – much to his dismay. “Hell naw,” the Dallas fan said while restrained. “I ain’t done sh-t. He hit me first. F-ck that.” Even if their fans can’t fight, the Stars sit on top of the Central Division with a 30-13-10 record.
