Thanks a lot, Bill! Mayor Eric Adams is blaming the city’s current budget woes, including the whopping $4 billion the spiraling migrant crisis is estimated to cost, on predecessor Bill de Blasio — saying he budgeted for long-term investments using “temporary money.” Hizzoner on Friday slammed his predecessor for putting in place “permanent things with temporary money” — aka federal stimulus funds — that are now quickly drying up. “There are several things that are looming that really keeps me up at night. Number one, the fiscal cliff we’re about to hit,” Adams said in an interview with Caribbean Power Jam’s “The Reset Show.” “The previous administration put in place permanent things with temporary money. The stimulus from the federal government is running out in [2025]. It’s gone,” Adams continued, adding that he now needs to reexamine the books to avoid a budget shortfall. The hefty price tag of the Biden administration’s migrant crisis is among Adams’ major budget concerns. “You look at the asylum seeker crisis, 1.4 billion this fiscal year, 2.8 billion next fiscal year is just not possible,” the mayor said. “It’s not sustainable.” So far, the Big Apple has only received a measly 1% of the $1 billion Adams has called for to help cover the cost of providing housing and services to the influx of migrants flooding into the city amid Biden’s border crisis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency forked out $7.89 million in December, while another $2 million was allocated by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY). As of last Sunday, an estimated 44,500 migrants had surged into the city since the spring, with 28,800 living in 86 emergency shelters and processing centers.
