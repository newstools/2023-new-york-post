Ivana Knoll nearly stopped traffic in London this week. The Croatian model — who became known as the “sexiest fan” at the 2022 FIFA World Cup with her sultry outfits in Qatar — recently made heads turn during a photoshoot on the streets of Westminster. Knoll was seen strutting through the sidewalks and posing with police cars, historic structures and a red phone booth. The brunette beauty, whose hair was style down and straight, was dressed in a beaded black bodysuit that included a sheer bottom and plunging top. The model stepped out in a pair of open-toe platform heels as she smiled and blew kisses for the camera. It’s unclear what the photoshoot was for. On Wednesday, Knoll attended Floyd Mayweather’s birthday skate bash in London. She shared a series of photos and videos to her Instagram Story inside the party, including a selfie with supermodel Naomi Campbell. Mayweather, who turns 46 on Friday, is in London promoting his fight against Aaron Chalmers, which takes place on Friday at the O2 arena. Although it’s unclear if Knoll will attend the fight, she is living her best life in London. Following her photoshoot, she took to Instagram to share that she found the “the best lymphatic drainage” in the city with Flavia Morellato, who’s an expert in the massage therapy technique. Knoll has been rubbing shoulders with a number of celebrities after winning over the internet at the 2022 World Cup. The model rang in the New Year with actor Jamie Foxx in Miami, where the pair also enjoyed a group dinner with friends. That came around the same time Knoll was seen cozying up to Drake in Miami. Knoll, who is based in Miami, is represented by a Los Angeles modeling agency. She obtained a visa in October, which allows her to work in the United States for the next three years. The “Knoll Doll” swimwear founder has over 3 million Instagram followers.
