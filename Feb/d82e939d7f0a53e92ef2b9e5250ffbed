It was a newlyweds’ night out for Brooks Koepka and his wife, Jena Sims. On Wednesday, the couple — who tied the knot last summer — stepped out for LIV Golf’s first welcome party of the year in Mexico, where the tour’s season-opening event will begin on Friday. Styled in a cutout blue dress that she accessorized with Stephanie Gottlieb jewelry, the 34-year-old Sims stunned at the party, where she posed for pics with pals and Koepka, 32. A four-time major champion, Koepka joined LIV Golf in June of last year. When asked about his decision to defect to the controversial Saudi-backed league, Koepka said at the time, “Opinions change. I feel very comfortable with the decision I made. I’m happy, and did what’s best for me.” Koepka currently serves as the Smash GC team captain, which consists of his younger brother, 29-year-old Chase Koepka, Jason Kokrak and Matthew Wolff. The foursome took to the stage Wednesday night, with Sims capturing the moment on her Instagram Stories. “Let’s go @smashgc,” she wrote alongside a blue heart emoji. It’s been an eventful few months for Koepka and Sims, who not only honeymooned in Europe following their June 2022 nuptials but filmed an appearance for the golf docuseries “Full Swing,” which recently premiered on Netflix. The Koepka-centric episode features the two-time U.S. Open and PGA Championship winner looking to recapture the spark from previous years. “Brooks wants to win, Brooks wants to be at number one again,” Sims said in the episode. Koepka currently ranks 85th in the Official World Golf Ranking.
