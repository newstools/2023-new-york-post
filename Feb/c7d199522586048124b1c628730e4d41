Talk about a snow-boar-der! A winter-sports enthusiast was caught off guard at a ski resort in Japan this month when he encountered a bold boar as he was finishing his snowboard run. In the captivating clip — taken by Haruki Takeuchi and posted to Instagram — the stouthearted swine is seen barreling down a hill toward a group of chatting snowboarders. Another pal tries to board over to the group but the pugnacious pig intercepts and knocks him over. He uses his board as a shield while his companions run off. Eventually the hardy hog goes after another snowboarder before continuing its wild run down the slope. The video was posted by the staff of Joey’s ski and snowboard shop with the caption: “’Wild [boar] ran into me and broke my snowboard binding.’ This is what our customer said when we came back into the shop. I said No Way. A for effort, good story. Well believe it or not someone filmed it. This is the proof.” Instagram commenters were in disbelief over the spirited sow. “That one time I was minding my own business & I got Hakuna Matata’d,” one Instagram user joked. “Oh goodness, that’s actually dangerous,” a concerned follower noted. “Love how everyone ran for their lives and not one staff member came out to help.” “Bro I am not paid enough to fight Peppa,” quipped another. It’s snout the first time a wild animal has disrupted a peaceful snow sesh. In 2017, a moose on the loose snatched headlines for surprising several skiers and snowboarders as it raced down a run at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado. In 2021, a hiker was caught off guard when a bull moose charged at him — and he captured his lucky escape in a POV video.
