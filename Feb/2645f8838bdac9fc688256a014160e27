Zac Stacy, former NFL running back, has been sentenced to prison time stemming from a 2021 attack on his ex-girlfriend that was caught on video. Stacy was sentenced to six months in prison and a year of probation by an Orange County judge, according to WESH, an NBC affiliate in Florida. Stacy reportedly pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal mischief; as part of the agreement, battery charges were dropped. Stacy played for the Rams and Jets in a three-year NFL career that spanned from 2013 to 2015. He later played for the Memphis Express in the XFL. Stacy was arrested by Orlando police in November of 2021 after he was caught on camera brutally beating the mother of his child, Kristin Evans, in her home. In an affidavit, police said Stacy “struck [her] on the right side of her head, and picked her up and threw her against the television, causing it to crack and fall over.” “He continued yelling at her and striking her while she got up from the floor, and picked her up again and threw her into the baby’s bouncy chair,” the affidavit continued. “While she was still on the floor pleading for him to stop, he picked her up and body-slammed her onto a baby walker, causing the object to break.” Stacy originally told police that his ex-girlfriend had “staged” the video out of “bitterness” because he did not want to be in a long-term relationship with her. “It’s unfortunate because I just got out of rehab for anxiety and depression-like eight months ago,” the former running back told police. “I dropped everything to come down here and support the mother of my child in her last trimester, and the baby. I let her know I wasn’t trying to be with her or nothing like that. This is a case of just bitterness. That’s why she did this. The whole assault thing. She staged it. She set me up.”
