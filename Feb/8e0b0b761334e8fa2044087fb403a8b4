Talk about sticker shock. A Porsche dealership in China was swamped with buyers after it advertised a 2023 Panamera for a jaw-dropping $18,000. The only problem is that the luxury sports car’s listed price should have been $148,000. The dealership in the northern town of Yinchuan realized its mistake and corrected the ad, but  not before hundreds of bargain-hunters tried to scoop up the German-made race car by putting down reservation fees of 911 yuan — or the equivalent of $135, according to Bloomberg News. The first customer who put down a reservation fee was contacted by the dealership, which “negotiated an agreeable outcome” over one of its cars, though the company did not specify. The rest of the would-be customers who put down the reservation fees will have those payments refunded to them within 48 hours, a Porsche spokesperson told the outlet. Porsche does nearly a third of its global business in China. In the first half of 2022, it sold  $6.2 billion worth of cars. The all-wheel drive 2023 Porsche Panamera boasts a 2.9-liter V6 cylinder engine and features that include interior climate control, heated seats, lane change assist, a surround sound system by Bose, and ambient lighting.
