Aaron Rodgers always has his head on a swivel. On his appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” earlier this week, which also featured a shot across the bow of NFL insiders Ian Rapoport and Adam Schefter, Rodgers mused about whether the recent spate of UFOs could be a distraction to keep people from thinking about more sinister things going on in the world. “There’s a lot of old papers and files about interactions Navy pilots have had with unidentified flying objects, so this is not surprising,” Rodgers said. “Obviously, there was some sort of Chinese spy balloon that was up in the air, allegedly, and there’s been a few other objects that have been shot down. I believe that this has been going on for a long time. Interesting timing on everything. There’s a lot of other things going on in the world.” Rodgers had a smirk and deadpan tone while he was saying all of this, leaving the viewer to wonder how serious he is about the conspiracy theories, or if he is just trying to get a rise out of the media and public hanging on his words. Asked if he thinks these occurrences are a distraction from what else is going on, Rodgers answered, “Could be some of that, yeah.” After McAfee brought up the train explosion in Ohio and said that there’s “a lot of s–t” going on, Rodgers brought up the Jeffrey Epstein client list. “Did you hear about the Epstein client list about to be released?” Rodgers asked. “There’s some files that have some names on it that might be getting released pretty soon. [Ghislaine] Maxwell was the only person ever convicted of the trafficking, and nobody who was involved in the trafficking ever went to jail, so … nothing to see here.”
