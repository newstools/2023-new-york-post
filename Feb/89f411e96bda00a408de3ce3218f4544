The final game of Thursday’s NBA schedule looks to be a good one when the Milwaukee Bucks host the Los Angeles Clippers. The Bucks enter the game as the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 34-17 record. Milwaukee has won five straight games coming into tonight and superstar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is having another outstanding season, averaging 31.8 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team. Things haven’t been quite as smooth for the 29-25 Clippers, but they have been playing well as of late. Los Angeles has won six of its past seven games and star players Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have put together good games. Leonard has scored at least 30 points in his last two games. Milwaukee’s home crowd always brings a lot of energy, so this should make for a good game to close out Thursday’s action.
