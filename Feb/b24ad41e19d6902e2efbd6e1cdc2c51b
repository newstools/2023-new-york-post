Russia tested an intercontinental ballistic missile  Monday while President Biden was in Ukraine that appears to have failed, according to a report. US officials told CNN on Tuesday that Russia used a deconfliction line to notify the US in advance of the missile test, which reportedly did not pose a risk to the country. According to the officials, the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. The test was of a nuclear-capable heavy SARMAT missile, dubbed Satan II by NATO, and classified as a “superweapon” by the head of Russia’s aerospace research agency. US officials believe the test failed since Russian President Vladimir Putin did not mention it in his State of the Nation address on Tuesday. During his address, Putin announced that Russia will be suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States. US officials notified the Kremlin on Sunday, through the de-confliction line, that Biden, 80, would be making the voyage to the Ukrainian capital ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. The reported test launch of the missile designed to carry up to 15 nuclear warheads, as well as hypersonic munitions, is Putin’s latest apparent attempt at saber-rattling aimed at the US. Last week, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said that the US military intercepted eight Russian fighter jets near Alaska in two separate incidents. The first group of four Russian aircraft — which included a Tupolev TU-95 BEAR-H strategic bomber and SU-30 and SU-35 fighter jets — approached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone on Feb. 13 and were followed by a second quartet a day later, according to NORAD. In both incidents, NORAD sent US fighter jets and support aircraft to intercept the Russian warplanes.
