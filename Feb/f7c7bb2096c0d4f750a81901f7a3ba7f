VH1 reality TV star Deelishis revealed Tuesday that her niece — a student at Michigan State University — is missing in the wake of the campus shooting that left three dead and five others wounded. Deelishis, whose real name is Chandra Davis, took to Instagram to say her niece, Arielle, was inside the East Lansing campus building when the gunman opened fire Monday night. “My beautiful niece @ariellediamond_ is a student at MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. She was in her classroom in the same building as the active shooter and we have not heard from her,” wrote the 45-year-old, best known for winning VH1’s “Flavor of Love.” “If you know her whereabouts please dm me … in the meantime my family and I ask for your prayers,” she added alongside a photo of her niece. The gunman, since IDed as Anthony Dwayne McRae, opened fire at the university’s Berkey Hall, an academic building, and later at the nearby MSU Union, which is a popular hub to eat or study. Hours later, McRae, 43, fatally shot himself after being confronted several miles away by cops following a manhunt that forced frightened students to hide in the dark. Police have only identified two of the three slain students — sophomore Brian Fraser and junior Alexandria Verner. Cops said the third victim’s identity was being withheld due to the family’s wishes. Two of those killed were gunned down at Berkey, while the third was shot dead at the MSU Union. The five injured victims remained at Sparrow Hospital on Tuesday in critical condition, police added.
