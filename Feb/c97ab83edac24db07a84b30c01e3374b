Smokey Robinson was rolling in the deep with marijuana and cocaine. The legendary singer and songwriter admitted he smoked marijuana with cocaine sprinkled inside his blunts in an interview released Wednesday with DJ Vlad on Vlad TV. The 82-year-old mentions he was never fond of drinking alcohol, noting he preferred lighting up a blunt. “Marijuana has always been my choice of drugs,” he said. The interviewer then asked, “I guess you sprinkled crack into your weed and smoked it that way?” The Motown singer quickly rebutted by saying, “No it wasn’t crack, it was before crack. It was cocaine.” Robinson said he didn’t start “dibbling and dabbling” into cocaine until his 40s, when developed an addiction to the white powder, describing himself as a “walking corpse.” During that time, he told Vlad TV that he lost so much weight, standing at 5 feet 11 inches and only weighing 120 pounds, he had to use safety pins to hold his clothes up. “I was in dire straits. I hated me,” he said. The “Cruisin'” singer said he continued to do cocaine when he mourned the loss of loved ones. “My dad died, then Marvin [Gaye] died. It’s just a lot of stuff was going on that was getting to me psychologically, which I didn’t realize it was,” he admitted. In 1986, he finally overcame his addiction to cocaine and is still clean to this day. “It was prayed off of me. I went to a church and a minister prayed for me and told me everything I was going through, which I haven’t told anyone in my life,” he said. “I walked in that church that night I was a junkie, you know, I was hooked on cocaine and weed. I came out and I was freed.”
