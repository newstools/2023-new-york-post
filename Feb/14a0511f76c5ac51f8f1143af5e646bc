Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Saturday: Gleyber Torres wasted no time getting on the board, smacking a double to left field in his first at-bat and then homering in his second time up. Torres will get in about four more Grapefruit League games before leaving next weekend to play for Venezuela in the WBC. Randy Vasquez, one of the Yankees’ top pitching prospects who spent last year at Double-A Somerset, gave up a two-run home run to Weston Wilson in the second inning, one of five hits he allowed before being removed after one-third of an inning. Vasquez then came back out for the third inning and gave up two more hits while recording two outs before being pulled again. Oswaldo Cabrera overran a ball off the bounce in left field in the fifth inning, allowing a single to turn into a double. Cabrera handled himself well in the corner outfield spots last year, but it’s easy to forget he had barely played there before doing so in the big leagues late last season. The Yankees will have a pair of split-squad games. Aaron Judge headlines the lineup staying in Tampa for the home opener against the Braves while Josh Donaldson and Anthony Volpe are on the travel roster for a road game against the Blue Jays.
