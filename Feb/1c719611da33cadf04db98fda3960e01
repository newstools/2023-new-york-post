Five people, including a child, were shot when a gunman opened fire during the Krewe of Bacchus parade in New Orleans Sunday — two days before hundreds of revelers will descend on the city to celebrate Mardi Gras. Shots rang out on Terpsichore Street around 9:30 p.m. as the parade was under way, New Orleans Police Department Chief Deputy Hans Ganthier told reporters during a press conference recorded by WDSU. Three men, a woman and a young girl were each struck by bullets. All five were rushed to local hospitals. The girl was listed in stable condition Sunday night, Ganthier said. One of the victims is in critical condition. “This is really not something we wanted to see,”  Ganthier said. “We really wanted this to be a safe Mardi Gras.” Police took one suspect into custody shortly after and recovered two guns at the scene, according to the chief. “We were quickly able to apprehend the suspect we believe responsible for this,” Ganthier said. Police are investigating whether there was a second shooter at the scene and encouraged any witnesses to call their Crime stoppers line. One witness told WWL-TV that they heard at least a dozen gunshots ring out — sending panic through the crowd of parade-watchers as they tried to run from the gunfire. He said police had broken up multiple skirmishes in the same area prior to the shooting. The Krewe of Bacchus parade has been held annually on the Sunday before Fat Tuesday in New Orleans since the 1960s. The carnival-style procession features large, colorful floats and is lead by a national celebrity who subs as the parade king.
