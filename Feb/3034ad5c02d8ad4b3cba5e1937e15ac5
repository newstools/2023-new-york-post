A beloved veteran Yonkers police detective died in a tragic car accident in Manhattan over the weekend, officials said. Del Caraballo, 48, was driving near West 29th Street and Eighth Avenue shortly after 2:30 p.m. Sunday when he suffered “a fatal medical event,” and sideswiped another vehicle, cops said. Caraballo — a 16-year veteran of the Yonkers Police Department — was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. “Our city is mourning a tragedy,” Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano said in a statement. “This detective was known and loved by many in the law enforcement community. He dedicated himself to our department and committed himself to protecting and serving this great city. “May his family be comforted and embraced by all of our sympathy and support.” An NYPD spokesperson said the city’s medical examiner would determine the exact cause of death in the incident. No others were injured in the two-car collision, police said. “Once again our hearts are broken at the loss of one of our finest,” Yonkers Police Commissioner Christopher Sapienza said in a statement. “We pray for his family and our brothers and sisters in blue,” he said. “His commitment to his family and the city of Yonkers will serve as his legacy.” Information on funeral arrangements was not immediately available.
