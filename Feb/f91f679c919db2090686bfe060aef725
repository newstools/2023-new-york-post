A 2-year-old child and five teenagers were among seven shot near a Philadelphia school Thursday evening as students were being dismissed from an after-school program, authorities said. Three gunmen dressed in all black got out of a car and opened fire as students left James Blaine School in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood just before 6 p.m., Fox 29 reported. The suspects reportedly pumped over 30 rounds, prompting the youngsters to flee back to the schoolyard for cover, according to the outlet. One victim, a 15-year-old boy, was shot twice in the chest and is in critical condition. The other six victims are in stable condition, police said. A 31-year-old woman was shot twice in her leg and her 2-year-old daughter was shot once in the leg. A 13-year-old boy was shot once in the hand, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the arm, another 16-year-old boy was shot once in the arm and once in the leg, and a 17-year-old boy suffered a graze wound to his leg. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her department is investigating if the shooting was targeted. “This has been a fairly quiet portion of the 22nd district for quite some time now,” Outlaw told reporters at the scene. “At this point, we’re piecing everything together to figure out if this is retaliatory, if some of those victims were intended or not, but it’s still really early to tell.” Police are looking for three suspects in connection with the shooting, who were seen in a 2011 to 2016 gray Hyundai Elantra, with unknown Pennsylvania plates. All there were dressed in black and wore hoods or face masks, according to a police description and surveillance images of the men. “Schools and other public spaces must remain safe havens for youth and the community,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said. “It’s heartbreaking and infuriating to learn of another shooting occurring on or near school grounds. I’m praying for the victims involved.”
