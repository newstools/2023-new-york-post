Nothing could have pleased New Yorkers more than Mayor Eric Adams finally putting his foot down this week and sweeping dozens of protesting migrants camped outside the Watson Hotel in Midtown. Until Wednesday, everyone outside of the political and activist class was dumbfounded by both City Hall’s major largesse and activists’ extremism in fueling the migrants’ demands. “Ingrates,” we heard New-Yorkers-in-the-street describe the migrants who refused transfer from the hotel to the Brooklyn center. These men (all single) enjoyed $300-a-night private rooms (with bath and shower) in the heart of Midtown, luxuries most taxpayers envy. It’s “bulls—,” fumed Bonfilio Solis, a Mexican immigrant who owns a remodeling business. He told The Post that the migrants were being “very disrespectful.” A new Quinnipiac poll shows that a majority of New York residents agree with the mayor that the 40,000-plus migrants who’ve descended on Gotham (so far) have pushed the city to a breaking point and should be moved upstate. New Yorkers are generous and big-hearted, but the slew of free stuff for migrants —  meals, health care, haircuts, cellphones, ping-pong tables and Xboxes — has ordinary folks squawking big-time. The city has a hard enough time providing emergency shelter for homeless citizens (who don’t get the free stuff), let alone strangers who chose to come here. That the advocates insist all migrants should live large only infuriates the public. Yes, the Biden administration’s ultimately to blame here, for opening the border at the behest of national “advocates.” But “sanctuary city” used to mean simply protecting illegal immigrants from deportation — not insanely generous support for every migrant who crosses the border illegally. Hence the cheers when City Hall stopped worrying about what the advocates think, and started thinking like the city’s voters.
