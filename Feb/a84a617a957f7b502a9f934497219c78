Action Network NFL analyst C Jackson Cowart is in his first season in The Post’s Bettor’s Guide. Here are his best bets for the Super Bowl. I’m all over the Eagles in every which way ahead of Sunday’s matchup, and I’m frankly surprised we haven’t seen this line move even further in their favor after that rush of early money. Everyone is talking about Philadelphia’s sizable advantage up and down the roster, and that’s certainly true. Yet not enough people are talking about exactly how well-suited the Eagles are for this specific matchup: Their devastating and clock-draining run game is famously the best way to beat a Patrick Mahomes-led team, and their elite pass rush and secondary are the perfect foil for this banged-up Chiefs passing attack. Mahomes may say he’s close to 100 percent, and he was clearly good enough to pull off a gutsy win in the AFC Championship. Still, are we just chalking up Kansas City for 30 points here? The last time we did that in the Super Bowl, the Buccaneers’ defense silenced Mahomes and Co. in a way that was shocking only to those who valued Mahomes’ greatness over a clear roster advantage for Tampa Bay.  Sound familiar? I think we’re headed for a similar result here — maybe not as lopsided, but even that wouldn’t shock me with how unstoppable the Eagles’ dynamic rushing attack has been even against the best defenses in the league. Championship weekend: 1-1. Eagles-49ers Under (W), Bengals (L) Season: 23-16-1
