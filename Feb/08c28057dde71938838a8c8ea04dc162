Leonardo DiCaprio is not dating 19-year-old model Eden Polani, The Post can confirm. A source close to the 48-year-old “Don’t Look Up” actor and Polani told The Post Tuesday that there is “absolutely no truth” to the romantic rumors surrounding the two, who were photographed sitting next to each other at Ebony Riley’s music-listening party in Los Angles on Jan. 31. The insider elaborated that stars aren’t always dating the person they’re seen sitting next to and that a zoomed-out picture of DiCaprio and Polani would show many other people sitting around them. The Post has contacted representatives for DiCaprio and Polani. The denial comes after the “Wolf of Wall Street” star, who is notorious for only romancing women under age 25, was roasted on social media for allegedly dating Polani — who was born six years after his film “Titanic” came out in 1997. “Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend is so young her high school experience was interrupted by COVID-19,” slammed one tweeter on Monday. “48-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio insists that everything is great between him and his 19-year-old girlfriend adding, ‘The only thing that’s difficult is when I have to talk to her,’” wrote another critic. “Stop making jokes about Leonardo DiCaprio being a almost 50 dating literal teenagers and start calling him what he is – a predator,” slammed one person. DiCaprio is also rumored to be dating climate activist Victoria Lamas, 23, as the two were spotted together on New Year’s Eve. Lamas was absent from Riley’s release party.
