Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Thursday: Starling Marte took swings in live batting practice for the first time this spring. The veteran outfielder is easing into workouts after undergoing core muscle surgery in November. “We’re happy with his progression,” manager Buck Showalter said. Darin Ruf is hoping to begin swinging on Friday. The veteran outfielder received a cortisone injection in his right wrist this week and has been limited in workouts. Daniel Vogelbach had a solid at-bat against Kodai Senga in live batting practice, delivering a sharp single to left field. Eduardo Escobar, Jeff McNeil and Tommy Pham were among the other players to take at-bats against Senga. The Mets will play an intrasquad scrimmage at Clover Park to prepare for their split-squad Grapefruit League openers on Saturday.
