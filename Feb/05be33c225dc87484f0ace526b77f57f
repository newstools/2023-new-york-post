Megyn Kelly lashed out at Leonardo DiCaprio amid rumors that the 48-year-old star of Hollywood blockbusters like “Titanic” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” was dating 19-year-old Israeli model Eden Polani. “He’s just going to keep banging teenagers the rest of his life,” Kelly said during Tuesday’s broadcast of her SiriusXM podcast “The Megyn Kelly Show.” Kelly’s show was taped before The Post quoted an insider who said that the two are not an item. DiCaprio was recently photographed with the stunning beauty at a party in Los Angeles — setting off a whirlwind of speculation that the reputed lothario was going out with someone who only recently became a legal adult. “He is now dating a teenager, literally a teenager,” Kelly fumed, noting that DiCaprio’s alleged cut-off age for girlfriends is 25. “He’s in the news every week for how he won’t date anybody past age 25. If he does, it makes news … And now he’s actually gone down to a teenager,” Kelly said. “She could literally be his daughter.” Kelly also said the aging playboy “looks almost as bad as Madonna.” “He is bloated — you could tell this guy partied a little bit too much,” Kelly said, before  urging him to “step away from the booze.” Kelly spared Polani any venom, saying: “She’s gorgeous. Okay, great. She’s a model, of course. They all are.” But she said DiCaprio’s apparent willingness to stick to much younger women was “sad.” “I feel like this guy from the rate of things is never going to know the joy of meeting somebody who he can fall in deep love with and build a family with,” Kelly said. “He’s just going to keep banging teenagers for the rest of his life.” Kelly added: “It doesn’t strike me as something to emulate.” DiCaprio has been linked to several models and actresses including Blake Lively, Bar Refaeli, Nina Agdal, Camila Morrone and Gigi Hadid, among others. They all dated the actor when they were in their early to mid-20s.
