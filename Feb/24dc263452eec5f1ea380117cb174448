Bryce Harper plays for the Phillies, but in Phoenix on Monday, he was caught on team white socks. The slugger and his wife Kayla were stopped on their way through the airport by an autograph-seeking fan. Not having a sharpie to sign a hat, Harper did the next-best thing: he found a pen and inked his left shoe, giving the fan a rather unique keepsake. “I cannot take you seriously,” Kayla told Harper in videos she posted to her Instagram story. It should come as no surprise the 30-year-old is willing to go above and beyond. On Saturday, he helped get an “E-A-G-L-E-S” chant going on the 16th hole of TPC Scottsdale as he watched the Phoenix Open. The next night, he continued to support his Philly neighbors, hanging at State Farm Stadium with boxer Ryan Garcia for the Super Bowl. Much like the Eagles, Harper’s Phillies came up short in their quest for the title. They dropped a heartbreaking World Series to the Houston Astros in November, though the seven-time All-Star hit .349 with six homers and 13 RBIs in 17 postseason games despite a lingering elbow injury. As spring training camps begin to open up, the reigning National League champions will have some extra support in the form of shortstop Trea Turner, who inked an 11-year, $300 million free agency deal, and former Mets starter Taijuan Walker. They’ll get started without Harper, however, as the two-time NL MVP recovers from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow in late November. He’s expected to be back by the All-Star break and back in right field before the end of the season after having not played the field since April. 16 of last season.
