Phil Regan, the former pitching coach of the Mets, has filed a lawsuit against the organization, alleging age discrimination, TMZ reported Tuesday. Regan, a former player-turned-coach, served as the interim pitching coach for the Mets beginning in June 2019 following Dave Eiland’s firing. Regan, who was 82 at the time, claims in the suit that the team’s former general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, said he would not return because he was “too old.” In a statement to TMZ, Regan’s attorney, Matthew Blit, elaborated on his client’s decision to take action. “Phil is the first to crack jokes about his age,” Blit said, “however there is nothing funny about a person being told that they are being passed over because their employer wants someone younger. That’s discrimination, plain and simple.” In September 2019, about three months into Regan’s tenure, Mets pitchers had a 3.52 ERA in the second half of the season. The team’s starting pitchers had a 3.06 ERA. During that time period, Regan seemed unclear about his future with the team, stating, “At my age, whatever happens, happens.” He also said, “I’m sure [the Mets] will decide what they are going to do and whatever happens, happens.” Mickey Callaway was the Mets manager that season and he was fired after the 86-76 campaign. The Mets hired Jeremy Hefner, then 33, in November of 2019. Hefner, a former pitcher for the Mets, began his coaching career with the Twins. Regan, now 85, is said to be suing for unspecified damages, per TMZ, which further reported that the Mets have not yet commented on the matter. Before he became the interim pitching coach, Regan was an assistant minor league pitching coordinator for the Mets. He was also the pitching coach for Single-A Port St. Lucie from 2009-15.
