Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Monday: Tim Locastro went 2-for-3 with a stolen base in the Mets’ 12-7 loss to the Cardinals in Jupiter, Fla. The speedy Locastro, who played for the Yankees in parts of the last two seasons, is in camp as a backup outfield option. The spring can only improve for Mets right-hander Jose Chacin, who retired one batter and allowed five earned runs in the fifth inning, leaving him with a spring training ERA of 135.00. Chacin allowed three hits and two walks. David Peterson fielded Paul Goldschmidt’s squib near the third-base line and made an athletic jump throw to first base in time to nail Goldschmidt for the out. Jose Quintana is scheduled to face the Astros at Clover Park in his Mets’ Grapefruit League debut.
