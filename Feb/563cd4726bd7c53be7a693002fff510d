Chilling video shows a gunman wildly shooting up a Brooklyn jewelry store, wounding a worker, during a brazen broad-daylight robbery over the weekend. The suspect walked up to the A&M Jewelry store on Fifth Avenue near 48th Street in Sunset Park just before 2 p.m. Sunday and began firing as he stood in the open doorway demanding money, according to the NYPD and the footage it released Monday. One bullet grazed a 24-year-old male worker in the torso, cops said. A shot then appeared to ricochet back toward the suspect, and he bolted out the door without taking anything, according to police and the video. The worker was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, where he is listed in stable condition. Police are still looking for the shooter.
