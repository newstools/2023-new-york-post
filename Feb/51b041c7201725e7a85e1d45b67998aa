Twice fans, this is your year. In fact, you may even be able to see the K-Pop girl group live more than, um, twice this year when they tour the world as part of their fifth World Tour “Ready To Be.” After international dates in South Korea, Australia and Japan, the nine-member outfit lands in the U.S. for nine shows at stadiums, arenas and ballparks from June 10 through July 9. And listen up, New Yorkers and New Jerseyans — the hitmakers are stopping into East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium for a huge concert on July 6. That will be a historic show too. The July 6 gig will be the the first time a K-pop girl group has ever headlined at the Giants’ and Jets’ home stadium. Best of all, if you want to see Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu live this year, you can grab tickets as early as today. Although the registration for Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan On Sale Access goes until March 8, fans who want to ensure they have tickets ahead of time can purchase on sites like Vivid Seats before they’re officially on sale. Vivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. They have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.  A complete calendar of all upcoming Twice tour dates including venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.  When Twice puts out a new single, they go big. Upon the release of their most recent song, the ebullient “MOONLIGHT SUNRISE,” they dropped a house remix, club remix, R&B remix and instrumental version of the track. You can hear all five (!) versions of “MOONLIGHT SUNRISE” here. Prior to the single, they put out the poppy, seven-track “BETWEEN1&2.” Click here to check out the band’s latest full offering. Keep an eye out for their next record “READY TO BE.” It’s set for release on March 10.  It appears Twice sticks to a script when they play on the road.
