The NBA All-Star game is getting new stars. Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards, Kings point guard De’Aaron Fox and Raptors forward Pascal Siakam will all head to Salt Lake City on Feb. 19 as injury replacements. The three players, who were picked by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, will replace Zion Williamson, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. Edwards is having a career year with the Timberwolves after being drafted as the first pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. The shooting guard is averaging 24.7 points per game on a 46.4 field gold percentage. Edwards, one of the league’s best perimeter guards, is also averaging 1.7 steals a game and leads the league in total steals with 96. Fox has helped mold the Kings into a playoff-contending team alongside Domantas Sabonis. The speedy point guard is shooting a career-high 50.4 percent from the field and he is averaging 24.2 points and 6.3 assists per game. Siakam, who wasn’t traded during the NBA trade deadline amid immense rumors, has become the core star of the Raptors. The forward has expanded his passing game this season – he’s averaging a career-high 6.1 assists per game. He’s also putting up 25.2 points and grabbing 7.9 boards per game. With Williamson, Durant and Curry, three All-Star starters, unable to play, Joel Embiid, Lauri Markkanen and Ja Morant will be promoted to start. All three were previously selected as reserves for the All-Star game.
