Jamie Lee Curtis has entered the chat. The 64-year-old actress jumped to Ariana DeBose’s defense following the infamous BAFTAs rap that drew criticism last week. But Curtis didn’t see “what the f–k people are on about” when slamming the “West Side Story” actress’ lyricism. “For me, it was joyous, celebratory, sisterly, hot, spicy, and she’s just so incredibly talented,” Curtis gushed to Deadline Saturday night, explaining that the lack of enthusiasm on the crowd’s face was in part due to cameramen shoving cameras into the actor’s faces. Both DeBose, 32, and Curtis were in attendance at Sunday night’s SAG Awards at the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles, California. Curtis dazzled in a low plunging red gown while DeBose was pretty in pink in a two-piece suit. “Angela Bassett did the thing, Viola Davis my ‘Woman King,’ Blanchett Cate you’re a genius, Jamie Lee you are all of us,” DeBose, 32, rapped at the opening of the BAFTAs, which quickly became a meme. The clash of applause and critique from the internet prompted the Golden Globe-winning actress to deactivate her Twitter account. “She is a fantastic talent, these people should shut the f–k up, back the f–k off and let this woman shine just her light,” Curtis chided the haters. Her comments join in the chorus of praise for the performance amidst the online disgust – even BAFTA showrunner Nick Bullen slammed the critics, saying they probably “don’t like change.” “The songs she was singing are very familiar songs, the room was clapping, and people were sort of dancing to the music,” Bullen told Variety. “That rap section in the middle, mentioning the women in the room, was because it’s been a great year for women in film, and we wanted to celebrate that.”
