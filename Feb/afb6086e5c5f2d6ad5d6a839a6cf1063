Gov. Kathy Hochul wants a ban on all flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, on the grounds that flavors entice kids to get hooked on nicotine. But no ban on flavored pot products, which plainly carry the same risk? Not even chocolate edibles? Heck, the totally-legal Housing Works pot shop offers pot-vape-pens in “Pineapple,” “Pink Grapefruit” and “Cereal Milk.” Why the double standard? Meanwhile, some state lawmakers want to drop the alcohol-blood limit for Driving While Intoxicated from .08 to .05, even as the state still has no rules on similar tests for DWI under the influence of THC, the active ingredient in pot. “Identifying drivers impaired by cannabis use is of critical importance,” said state health officials in a procurement pitch to potential contractors last October. Yet “there are currently no evidence-based methods to detect cannabis-impaired driving.” Meanwhile, a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that fully legalizing marijuana brings (surprise) overall higher crash rates. And an alcohol-and-pot combo impairs drivers more than using either drug alone. We’re absolutely fine with laws and regulations aiming to protect kids from becoming addicts, or to keep impaired drivers off the roads. But, more than two years after the Empire State legalized pot, our leaders seem to be treating it as if it poses no risks to anyone at all. Can we get some consistency, people? Sometimes, it feels like the whole state is on acid.
