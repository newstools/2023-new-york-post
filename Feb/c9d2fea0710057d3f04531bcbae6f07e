An East Village man arrested for a series of shoplifting strikes at a Greenwich Village Duane Reade died in police custody, the NYPD said. Travis Durkin, 47, was accused of stealing $455 worth of merchandise from the drugstore on West Fourth Street near Broadway on Jan. 15 and $1,238 in goods on Jan. 16, police said. When Durkin returned to the same Duane Reade on Jan. 18, he allegedly tried to steal $40 worth of merchandise, but this time cops took him into custody, the NYPD said. He was charged with two counts of criminal possession of stolen property, two counts of grand larceny and one count of petit larceny for the three incidents, police said. After his Jan. 18 arrest, Durkin was found unconscious in a holding cell, and was taken to Manhattan Central Booking where he was awaiting arraignment, the NYPD said. He was pronounced dead Thursday, police announced on Friday. “He died weeks later after being admitted to the hospital,” an NYPD spokeswoman confirmed Saturday. The incident is under investigation by the NYPD’s Force Investigation Division.
