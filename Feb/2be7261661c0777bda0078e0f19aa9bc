La Salle comes into its matchup Saturday against George Mason red-hot, having won five straight games. Last Saturday, I gave out the Explorers over Massachusetts as my college basketball Top Play. I bet them again on Wednesday as a slight home ’dog to Richmond. You know the old saying, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I’m going back to La Salle again. The key to La Salle’s late-season turnaround has been an improved offense. The Explorers’ offensive metrics don’t look good overall, but in the last five games, La Salle is averaging 75.6 points and has topped 70 four times. George Mason has been excellent at home this season, where the Patriots are 10-2. La Salle won its last two road games, however, against Saint Joseph’s and St. Bonaventure. Those two teams are a combined 21-7 at home. Before the five-game winning streak started, La Salle lost to Rhode Island on the road by just two points. The bottom line here is that the market still hasn’t adjusted to La Salle. The Explorers were +1.5 to Richmond on Wednesday when I made them -3. George Mason should be favored at home in this matchup, but not by this much. Oddsmakers still aren’t giving an improved La Salle squad enough respect. Turnovers are something to watch in this game. George Mason has issues protecting the basketball, ranking 304th in turnover percentage by KenPom. In its last five wins, La Salle has forced an average of 12 turnovers. La Salle has covered six straight games. I’m riding the hot hand and backing the Explorers to cash again on Saturday.
