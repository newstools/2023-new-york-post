Ahead of an iconic musical’s closure, the venue that served as its original story’s setting is opening itself to overnight stays. As Broadway’s longest-running show, “The Phantom of the Opera,” prepares for its final curtain drop in New York City later this year, the Paris space that the 1910 Gaston Leroux novel is based on is inviting guests to stay there for the first time ever. For the one-night-only occasion, the Palais Garnier Opera is transforming its Box of Honor into a “majestic bedroom” to rest in when guests are done exploring the iconic building’s halls, including the real underground lake, where the story’s Phantom lives. The great-granddaughter of the writer — whose tale of a deformed composer haunting the opera house and falling in love with the young soprano, Christine, has entertained Broadway audiences for 35 years — will host the event. “My great-grandfather’s classic story has inspired so many people through the years,” said Véronique Leroux. “This is the perfect time to honor him and welcome ‘phans’ to the famous setting of his much-loved novel for a once-in-a-lifetime stay.” Before beginning its record-breaking Broadway run, the Andrew Lloyd Webber-soundtracked musical was first experienced in 1986 in London. It has since been enjoyed by more than 145 million people in 183 cities in 17 languages. It’s even won a stock of Tonys and four Olivier awards. Applications for the overnight lodging will be considered on a first-come, first-serve basis on Wednesday, March 1 beginning at noon Eastern Standard Time, when phans can apply via Airbnb’s website. The stay itself will happen on Sunday, July 16 and cost $39. In addition to being able to have the exclusive space to themselves for the evening, guests will also enjoy a private ballet initiation from a Opera de Paris Ballet dancer, an exclusive recital from the Paris Opera Academy, plus dinner in the Foyer de La Dance — the historic rehearsal room behind the stage.
