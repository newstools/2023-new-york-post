Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is feeling the love from his family following Kansas City’s Super Bowl 2023 win. Moments after the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, 38-35, Brittany Matthews made her way to the field at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, to celebrate her husband’s second Super Bowl victory. “MY BABY DID IT!!!!!” the 27-year-old Matthews tweeted. Matthews greeted Mahomes, also 27, as the celebrations continued on the field, where the longtime couple was joined by their daughter, Sterling Skye, who turns 2 years old later this month. Mahomes, the league’s newly crowned MVP, shared a kiss with Matthews, whom he married in Hawaii last March. Super Bowl 2023 got off to a shaky start for the Chiefs, who trailed the Eagles at halftime, 24-14. Things teetered into a possible nightmare scenario for Kansas City when Mahomes — who suffered a high-ankle sprain earlier in the postseason — appeared to re-aggravate the injury. Despite the apparent pain, Mahomes started the second half and led the Chiefs to a comeback win over the Eagles, going 21-of-27 in passing for 182 yards and three touchdowns. He was later named the game’s MVP and hoisted the Lombardi Trophy with Matthews and Sterling by his side. Matthews — who gave birth to the couple’s son child in November, son Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III — then joined Mahomes during Fox’s postgame show, where the quarterback joked about being 2-0 when the network broadcasts the Super Bowl. “We gotta have Fox do all of them from now on,” Mahomes said. Mahomes won his first Super Bowl in February 2020 with a thrilling victory over the 49ers. They would get trounced by the Buccaneers a year layer in a Super Bowl that was broadcast by NBC.
