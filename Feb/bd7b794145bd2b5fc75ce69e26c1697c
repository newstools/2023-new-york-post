Southwest Airlines is being grounded over this video. The troubled airline posted a TikTok Friday chronicling the adventures of a stuffed dog — aptly named Dog Dog — that was left behind on a flight from Dallas and its return to his owner. The Tiktok, which has since been deleted, took off with over 600,000 views. “POV: A Southwest employee retrieves your left-behind stuffed animal and mails him back to you along with a photo album showing his adventures while he was away from you,” read the post. The heartwarming video did not stop irate passengers from slamming the airline for the thousands of cancellations in December, saying that the company was on “damage control” “I’m surprised the stuffed animal’s flight didn’t get canceled,” one comment read. “That’s cool and all but y’all still left me stranded at the airport for three days,” read another. Other users applauded the airline’s dedication to reuniting the dog and its owner. According to the maligned airline, Dog Dog’s owner — a child named Luna — was traveling with her mother — Jessica — who worked with Southwest when they realized that they had left the stuffed animal behind. “I couldn’t believe we left her stuffed lovey behind, so I quickly called my colleague Christina who has been a friend through work for years, and she offered to go pick it up,” said Jessica. “A week later Christina’s house flooded and I was hesitant to reach back out.” “But to no surprise, she kept Dog Dog safe and pulled in a few other employees to make some memories with Luna’s stuffed pup,” she continued. Several of the photos of the stuffed animal show the puppy on the tarmac, sipping from water and flying high in the sky
