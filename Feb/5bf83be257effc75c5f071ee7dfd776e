Vanessa Hudgens and Cole Tucker are soon to say, “I do.” The 34-year-old actress and 26-year-old baseball player got engaged at an unspecified date at the end of 2022, TMZ revealed earlier this week. They have been dating for about two years. Before she met Tucker, Hudgens dated a litany of famous actors. Hudgens, who starred in the “High School Musical” series of films for Disney, reflected in 2021 about how she met her now-fiancé. “Me and Cole met on a Zoom meditation group. Very random, yes,” she told “Entertainment Tonight” at the time. “Zoom, you’ve got to love it.” “He’s just kind of perfect for me,” Hudgens marveled in the interview. “I am [happy]. I really am. I think that it’s also so important to stay grateful for everything that you have in life. I’ve been making that a priority, and I feel like it’s just been making magic happen all the more.” Tucker played on the Pirates from 2019-22. He has a .211 batting average, five home runs and 35 RBIs in 436 career big league at-bats. This offseason, Tucker signed a minor league deal with the Rockies organization. Prior to Tucker, Hudgens dated a number of famous Hollywood stars. According to Us Weekly, the list includes Zac Efron, Josh Hutcherson, Austin Butler and basketball player Kyle Kuzma. Over this past Thanksgiving, Hudgens expressed her appreciation for Tucker in an Instagram post. “Happy day of giving thanks,” Hudgens wrote in November, with a heart emoji. “Thru though times I’ve always leaned on gratitude to lift my spirit. So much to be grateful for. Mother Nature, Fam, friends, dis man. The list goes on n on  I hope by focusing on the things your grateful for today your spirit is lifted.”
