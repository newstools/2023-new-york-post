The New Jersey Devils continue to run hot. They are 11-1-2 in their last 14 games and 6-1-1 in their last eight. Five of the Devils’ last seven victories, however, have come after regulation, and another came thanks to a game-winning goal with two seconds left against the last-place Columbus Blue Jackets. Full credit to the Devils for getting wins, but going to overtime every other game is not a recipe for success when you’re the favorite in hockey. 9:00 p.m. ET, ESPN The fact they aren’t getting the job done in regulation isn’t the only concern here, either. Not only is Jack Hughes out for the foreseeable future, but also the Devils are struggling to control play at 5-on-5, which has caused them to rely heavily on their goaltenders to keep them in games. Vitek Vanecek and Mackenzie Blackwood have answered the call thus far, but it’s hard to imagine them sustaining this level for much longer. Over their last 10 games, the Devils rank in the bottom 10 in shot-attempt rate, expected goals percentage and high-danger scoring chance rate. That is a far cry from what we saw when they were running roughshod through the NHL a few months ago. The St. Louis Blues have been a mess all season and already waved the white flag by trading away Vladimir Tarasenko, but this comes down to selling high on the Devils at a good price.
