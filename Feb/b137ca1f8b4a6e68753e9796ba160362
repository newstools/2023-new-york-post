No team in the NHL has treated under bettors better than the Winnipeg Jets. Not only has the under cashed in Winnipeg’s last nine contests, but it’s come through in 40 of the Jets’ 57 games, a 70.2 percent win rate. It’s easily the best mark in the NHL. The Jets are a decent defensive outfit, but most of the credit for Winnipeg’s over/under splits is due to Connor Hellebuyck’s performance in goal. According to MoneyPuck, Hellebuyck ranks third in Goals Saved Above Expected (GSAx) behind Linus Ullmark and Ilya Sorokin. 7 p.m. ET., ESPN+ While Sorokin is almost certain to start on Wednesday against Winnipeg, there is a decent chance that Hellebuyck sits after playing on Sunday and Monday against the Devils and Rangers, the latter of which required him to make 50 saves in a 4-1 win. That would mean the Islanders would face Hellebuyck’s deputy, Dave Rittich. After struggling the past few seasons, Rittich has provided average results for the Jets in 15 outings in 2022-23. Even if Hellebuyck gets the nod, the over looks to be in range on Wednesday night, as the Islanders have been playing some pretty high-event contests recently. There have been a total of 46 goals scored in the Islanders’ last six games, and only three teams have created more high-danger scoring chances at five-on-five over their previous 10 contests than Lane Lambert’s side. Winnipeg’s under splits will likely depress this total, which should provide value on a contrarian over. Over 5.5 goals (-109, BetRivers)
