For more than two years, Hunter Biden and his father have dismissed the “laptop from hell” as a fraud, a hack or “Russian disinformation.” Then, Wednesday evening, Hunter’s lawyers did an abrupt U-turn. Yes, the laptop computer is his, they finally admit. But information from it was published without his permission! Why the change? Well, investigations are coming from the Republicans in Congress, and pretending the laptop isn’t real won’t work anymore. Under Elon Musk, Twitter won’t run interference for the president by censoring stories, and even The New York Times admitted, grudgingly, that Hunter’s emails are authentic. New tactic: Hunter is the victim. His privacy was invaded. He has struggled with demons, we all know, but Congress is just victimizing him to go after his dad. Don’t buy a word of it. Hunter Biden is a privileged son who leveraged his family’s name and access to make millions — much of which he frittered away on drugs and prostitutes. His laptop wasn’t “stolen.” He dropped it off at a computer repair shop, handed over the password, then never picked it up because he was too addled to do so. Hunter Biden isn’t a victim. He’s a con artist. One lie has been admitted. Let’s see what is revealed next.
