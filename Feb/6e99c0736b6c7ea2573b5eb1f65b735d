Horrifying pictures show a young girl clinging to the outside of an amusement park ride as she dangles perilously above the ground. The dramatic ordeal was captured on camera at the Mount Isa 100 Years Celebration event in Queensland, with footage supplied toÂ 7NEWS. The incident occurred on a circular ride, which had slowed down to a near-stop, leaving the girl clinging to the side of the cart while suspended several meters above the ground. The footage shows the girl using her arms and one leg to grip onto the cart while attendees at the event watch on from below. She then falls to the ground and injures her leg. The severity of the injury is not known. The footage does not show the height from which she fell. Her parents rushed her to a local hospital for treatment, where she is receiving medical attention.
