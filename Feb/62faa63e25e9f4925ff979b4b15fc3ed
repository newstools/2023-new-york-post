Conagra Brands is recalling nearly 2.6 million pounds of its canned Vienna sausage and chicken products due to packaging issues that could cause contamination without consumers even noticing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Tuesday that items produced between Dec. 12, 2022, and Jan. 13, 2023, from brands including Goya, Kroger and Great Value may have damaged cans that could allow foodborne pathogens to enter. Various products of varying sizes shipped to retail stores nationwide fall under the recall. The government is urging consumers to check their recently purchased cans for a lot number of P4247. If the number is printed on the can, people should throw it away or return it. While canned meat is usually shelf stable, these targeted products may be leaking fluids and spoiling easily. “The cans subject to recall may have been damaged in a manner that is not readily apparent to consumers, which may allow foodborne pathogens to enter the cans,” the USDA said in a statement. The agency said Tuesday it has received no reports of illness associated with this recall, but a consumer might not experience the symptoms of eating contaminated meat until days later. Symptoms could include vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and stomach cramps.
