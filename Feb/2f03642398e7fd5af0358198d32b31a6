Christina Applegate has a message for MS: “FU.” The “Dead to Me” actress showed up at the SAG Awards on Sunday with a black-and-white cane with the hashtag “FU MS” and walked the red carpet with her 12-year-old Sadie. The 51-year-old wore a black velvet tuxedo-inspired gown and her daughter matched in a black tuxedo-style blazer. Applegate has been battling multiple sclerosis for a few years and said the SAG Awards would likely mark her last-ever red-carpet appearance as she deals with the disease. “It’s my last awards show as an actor probably, so it’s kind of a big deal,” The “Married . . . With Children” alum told the Los Angeles Times. Applegate previously gave an “FU” to the disease when she received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in November. The actress, who first revealed her diagnosis in 2021, also hinted that she might not continue acting in the future. “Right now, I couldn’t imagine getting up at 5 a.m. and spending 12 to 14 hours on a set; I don’t have that in me at this moment,” she said. Applegate won’t disappear from Hollywood entirely, though, noting she plans on “doing a s – – t ton of voiceovers to make some cash to make sure that my daughter’s fed and we’re homed.”
