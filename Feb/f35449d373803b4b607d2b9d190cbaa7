LeBron James had remained quiet for most of Sunday after former teammate Kyrie Irving was traded to the Mavericks and not to the Lakers for a reunion. James did break the ice, however, with a cryptic three-word message on Twitter later Sunday night: ‘Maybe It’s Me.” While it’s unclear what the four-time world champion meant by that, it’s easy to speculate that he was referring to Irving leaving Brooklyn for Dallas in return for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected 2029 first-round selection as well as 2027 and 2029 second-round picks. The Lakers, who are trying to inject some life into their season, tried to get involved as Irving was interested in coming to L.A. and James had said adding the star guard would obviously help the team. The Lakers are currently 25-29 and in 13th place in the West – 2.5 games out of the play-in tournament. James and Irving played three seasons together in Cleveland, winning an NBA championship with the Cavaliers during the 2015-16 campaign. The dynamic duo split up a year later after tensions between the two grew. Irving left for Boston and James bolted for the Lakers in 2018. There was some belief Los Angeles was Irving’s desired destination, but ESPN reported the Nets preferred Dallas’ trade package to the ones discussed with the Lakers. Unless Los Angeles makes a move before Wednesday’s NBA trade deadline, James will be left trying to drag an already underachieving to the postseason.
