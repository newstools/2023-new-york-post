The city of Miami received mockery on Thursday after Mayor Francis Suarez unveiled a new police cruiser decorated with Africa-themed imagery to celebrate Black History Month. “This is a beautiful collaboration to commemorate Black history and Black History Month and the history of African Americans and our police department and our city,” Suarez said. “This is Black history.” Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales was also in attendance for the unveiling. Florida-based reporter Joshua Caballos claimed that the mayor’s office was not involved with the cruiser’s design. “I just spoke to Black police union (@mcpba1946) president Stanley Jean-Poix. He said Mayor Suarez’s office had nothing to do with the design of the car,” he wrote. “the design had the full approval of the union before it was unveiled. ‘It celebrates our African ancestry’ he said.” However, not everyone was happy about the new police vehicle. Former President & Director-Counsel of LDF (NAACP Legal Defense Fund) Sherrilyn Ifill was one such example, who tweeted, “THIS CANNOT BE.” Some Twitter users mocked the car for being a tone deaf tribute to Black History Month. MSNBC legal analyst Charles F. Coleman tweeted, “1. Because Florida 2. Tell me you don’t have a D&I person without telling me you don’t have a D&I person. 3. No, you don’t get credit for just trying. This type of tone deaf performative action is what provokes a ‘war on wokeness’ when we are made to accept the unacceptable.” Washington Examiner columnist T. Becket Adams wrote, “I laughed out loud.” Frequent MSNBC guest and outspoken liberal Elie Mystal tweeted, “… … Wut Is This? ????????” “I AM WHEEZING,” Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah tweeted. “The CEO of racism just had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,” digital strategist Greg Price joked that racism had been destroyed by the car’s political message. Fox News Digital reached out to Suarez’s office for comment about the criticism, but did not immediately receive a response.
