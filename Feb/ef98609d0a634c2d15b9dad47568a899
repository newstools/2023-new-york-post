She’s ready for another four-year stretch. “The View” co-host Joy Behar, 80, revealed Tuesday that she has no plans to leave the morning gabfest. The panel was discussing criticism of President Biden’s age as he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union speech. “Joe Biden and I are the same age. Would you say I could not do my job for the next four years? Of course I can,” Behar said. “And the haters can go stick their heads in something, because I’m not moving out of this seat.” Co-host Sunny Hostin said she often points octogenarian doubters in Behar’s direction since she excels in her job. Sara Haines also expressed amazement that Behar stretches backstage before the show. In response, Behar effortlessly lifted her right leg onto the discussion table and left it there, prompting her coworkers to burst out laughing. Behar joined “The View” at its inception in 1997, and she’s been a fixture ever since — except for the two-year break that started in 2013. “I was glad to be fired,” Behar told Time last year of that time. “I basically was sick of the show at that point for some reason, I don’t even remember why.” Since returning in 2015, the comedian has not shied away from sharing her opinions on “The View.” In January, Behar slammed “heterosexual men” for supporting tackle football: “45% of Americans think that tackle football is appropriate. Heterosexual men voted the most support for kids doing football. And conservatives were more likely to support youth tackle football. Just saying,” Behar said with disdain. “The View” co-hosts were discussing Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who collapsed during a Jan. 2 game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
