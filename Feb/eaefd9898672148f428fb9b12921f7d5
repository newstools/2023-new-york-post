“You know how sticky it gets.” So said Drake, one of North America’s finest songwriters last summer, on his his song “Sticky.” We’re not positive, but we believe that one of the biggest rappers in the world might have been referring to a poorly-made frying pan. This is pure conjecture, but we like to imagine that Drake, like us, loves a few over-easy eggs in the morning, maybe with avocado and red pepper flakes on top of a piece of toast. But the morning’s ruined when the yolk runs into the pan, instead of over the avocado toast, because the eggs stuck to the pan. Luckily for Drake, and for you, there’s a solution: the Misen Nonstick Frying Pan. Even luckier? It’s on sale for 48% off today on Amazon. Misen’s 10″ Nonstick Pan is a steal at its list price of $65, and doubly so at over $30 off. Their unique plasma primer makes for a high-quality, durable nonstick pan that’s perfect for eggs, fish, and anything else that may normally be tricky to fish out of your frying pan. Finally, Drake can rest easy. Misen ensures that they’ve worked tirelessly to design what they call the “best nonstick frying pan available,” complete with a flat bottom for even heat distribution, rubber ergonomic handle, and buttery coating.
