A Brazilian model and nightclub owner was discovered dead with 11 stab wounds in what authorities are calling a homicide. The grisly incident came to light on Feb. 3 after the body of Thaís Rocha Secundino, 28, was found in her jeep in São Paulo, Brazil. According to authorities, she had sustained knife wounds to her neck, abdomen and back, however, the murder weapon has yet to be recovered. Police suspect that Secundino, who owned several night clubs, was killed “over issues involving alleged embezzlement” of her businesses, said police spokeswoman Ivalda Aleixo. Authorities have since apprehended two suspects in the alleged killing: her 45-year-old male driver, Leandro Aparecido Dos Santos, and Cintia Maria Feliciano Peixe, 31, one of the victim’s best friends who worked at one of Secundino’s wine cellars. “The victim’s boyfriend said Thaís had gone to meet her friend to get an explanation from her, but then she didn’t return home,” explained Aleixo. “They deny the crime, but there are strong indications that they took part in the businesswoman’s murder.” Due to the “heinous” nature of the crime, the two suspects will be temporarily detained for 30 days, the spokeswoman said, according to Jam Press. As part of their investigation, cops have seized the victim’s car along with the suspects’ phones, which they plan to analyze. Authorities are also reviewing CCTV footage that was filmed in the area at the time of Thaís’ death. Investigators declined to provide further details so as not to impede the ongoing homicide probe. Along with owning several businesses, Secundino was also a fixture on Instagram, where she frequently posted bikini snaps for her followers. In her final post uploaded two weeks ago, the entrepreneur wrote: “The light that guides me is much stronger than the eyes that surround me.”
