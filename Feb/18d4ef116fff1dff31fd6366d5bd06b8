Vice President Harris accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity during a major address Saturday in Germany. In the keynote speech of the Munich Security Conference, Harris laced into Russia for its “widespread and systematic attack” against civilians during their yearlong war in Ukraine. “Their actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common humanity,” Harris said, citing evidence of execution-style killings, rape and torture. “The United States has formally determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity.” “Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown: justice must be served.” The vice president reiterated US support for Ukraine and warned that “we will make sure that whoever was involved in those crimes will be held accountable” “If Putin thinks he can wait us out he is badly mistaken. Time is not on his side. I am certain that Ukraine, U.S. and Europe will rise to the task,” Harris said. Harris’ accusation of crimes against humanity raises the prospect that Russia’s actions during the invasion could one day be adjudicated in the International Criminal Court. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement Saturday saying the US determination was based on “a careful analysis of the law and available facts.”
