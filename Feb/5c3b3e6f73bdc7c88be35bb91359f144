They are mashing this one theory. For years, food experts have warned consumers that putting potatoes in the fridge would increase a person’s risk of cancer — however, researchers at the Food Standards Agency now say that idea has spudded out. “Experts now say storing spuds in the fridge – previously thought to be a health risk – is a good way to get the most out of them, especially if you won’t use them straight away,” said a researcher Shefalee Loth. It was initially believed that when potatoes lingered in the fridge they form extra sugars, which turned into cancer-causing acrylamide when the spuds were fried, roasted or baked. “The most important food not to keep in the fridge are potatoes,” reads the FSA website. “When these are stored in the fridge, the starch in the potato is converted to sugar. When baked or fried, these sugars combine with the amino acid asparagine and produce the chemical acrylamide, which is thought to be harmful.” Loth also advised that other items such as bread and tomatoes also do not belong in the fridge. “Not many people will realize it could make bread stale and shorten the appeal of bananas or tomatoes,” said Loth.” According to Loth, cold temperatures change the texture of tomatoes and inhibit the enzymes that give them flavor. Loth continued by saying that cucumbers also do not belong in the fridge. Onions and garlic should be kept in a dark cabinet, while fruits and vegetables can be kept in the fridge separate from each other. The researcher also revealed that milk should not be placed on the door as it is one of the warmest areas of the fridge due to the constant opening.
