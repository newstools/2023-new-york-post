Jansen Panettiere, an actor and actress Hayden Panettiere’s brother, has reportedly died. He was 28. TMZ reported Monday that sources close to the family said Jansen died Sunday at home in New York. His cause of death is unclear at this time, but police say there was no foul play in his death, the outlet reported. An actor in his own right, Panettiere worked on early 2000s projects such as “Even Stevens,” “Blue’s Clues,” “Robots” and “Ice Age: The Meltdown.” Jansen, who was five years younger than Hayden, was her only sibling. The duo worked together on “Tiger Cruise” in 2004 and “Racing Stripes” in 2005. In 2008, Jansen was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his role as Luke in “The Last Day of Summer.” He voiced TrumanX in 15 episodes of Nickelodeon’s “The X’s” from 2005 to 2006. He also appeared in an episode of “The Walking Dead” in 2019. Jansen’s most recent credit was in the holiday comedy-drama movie “Love and Love Not” in 2022. He is credited with four more upcoming projects, according to his IMDb. Hayden, who stars in the upcoming “Scream 6” movie, has not yet publicly reacted to Jansen’s reported death. The Post has contacted reps for both Jansen and Hayden Panettiere for comment.
