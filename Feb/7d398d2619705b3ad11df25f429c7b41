Investing in the right laptop is important. Are you going to use it primarily for work, gaming, or browsing the New York Post Shopping Section? Does it need to be sturdy, travel-ready, or will it be staying put when you leave on vacation? Do you prefer a larger display, or are you fine with a smaller one? These are important questions. That is, at least they are with laptops that don’t check every box. But the Lenovo 2022 Ideapad 3 Laptop, now on sale on Amazon, isn’t just any laptop. With a 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Dual-Core 3.0GHz Processor (gesundheit!), 15.6″ touchscreen display, and 256GB of memory on its hard drive, it’s well equipped for just about anything you throw at it, from gaming to spreadsheets, and everything in between. Best of all, this week, the latest model of the Lenovo Ideapad 3 Laptop is marked down from $959 to just $377 on Amazon. That’s a price decrease of 61%. We’re not math whizzes here at The Post’s Shopping Section, but it’s our estimation that anything over 50% is more than half, and should be snapped up as soon as possible. This week, you can snag the Lenovo 2022 Ideapad 3 Laptop in Almond, previously nearly $1,000, for under $400.
