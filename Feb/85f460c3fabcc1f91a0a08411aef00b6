A grandmother was run over and killed by a forklift at a Florida hotel that was working on repairs from Hurricane Ian, police said. Police said 62-year-old Susan Brock was struck at the Beach Haven Motel in Daytona Beach Shores around 1:45 p.m. on Monday afternoon, Daytona Beach Shores Public Safety Director Chief Mike Fowler told WKMG-TV. Brock, who lived at the hotel, was hit by the lift while she was walking through the parking lot, officials said. She was taken to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. The forklift had been delivering roofing materials  to repair damages the hotel sustained when Hurricane Ian whacked the Florida coast in September. “This was a tragic accident, and we will conduct a full investigation to determine what led to it,” Chief Fowler said. Fowler said the driver didn’t see Brock before he hit her. Susan Brock’s grandson, Shawn Brock, told the news outlet that he still has questions about the accident that have not been answered. “How did she not move out of the way of it? Did she not hear it? Did she try to move out of the way?” he said. The driver is cooperating with investigators and OSHA has been notified, officials said.
