Marissa Lawrence has been by husband Trevor Lawrence’s side long before the Jaguars selected the quarterback with the top pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Speaking recently to Us Weekly, the second-year pro — whose Jaguars were knocked out of the postseason by the Chiefs in last month’s Divisional Round — opened up about his years-long romance with Marissa, whom he met in the fifth grade. “We started dating seriously in 10th grade. And then we were, like everyone, kind of [were] off and on for a while and then once we got to college it got really serious,” the 23-year-old Lawrence told the outlet. Married since April 2021, Marissa regularly cheers on Lawrence at Jaguars games, both at home in Jacksonville and on the road. Although the NFL season is perhaps their busiest time of the year, Lawrence said he and Marissa try to prioritize “some version of a date night.” “Whether that’s going out or that’s ordering in and just hanging out and having a glass of wine or whatever just to try to spend that time together,” Lawrence shared. “Cause during the week it gets kind of busy and then, especially, when we have families coming in town on the weekends and that’s even busier. We’ve gotten better and better at making time, making sure that we have time together and really prioritizing that.” Though Lawrence and Marissa have thought about potentially expanding their family one day, it doesn’t appear to be in the cards in the immediate future. “We’re just enjoying where we’re at and we wanna travel and be able to do all that before we kind of settle down,” the quarterback said. Recently, the Lawrences have been enjoying their first Pro Bowl experience, with Marissa taking to Instagram on Sunday to give her followers a peek at her game-day look. “Pro Bowl ‘game day,'” Marissa captioned the post. Lawrence is a member of this year’s AFC squad, which is being coached by Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning.
