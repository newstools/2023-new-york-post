A band of moped-riding crooks have snatched Apple headphones right off the heads of at least 21 people in the city in the past month, according to the NYPD. The crew – typically four thieves on two mopeds – first struck on Jan. 28, grabbing a 22-year-old man’s Apple AirPods Max headphones on Ninth Avenue and West 26th Street in Chelsea and then speeding off, police said. The crooks have terrorized New Yorkers ranging in age from 18 to 41 across Manhattan — including one incident in Central Park — usually striking in mid-to-late afternoon, according to cops. They pulled off five of the headphone thefts on Feb. 8. Then 10 days later, they ripped off eight people within an hour on Feb. 18, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig told reporters Friday. The thieves remain at large, and no arrests have been made. “We’ve got to catch these guys,” Essig said. Police released a photo of two suspects riding mopeds and a video showing one of them carrying two AirPod Max headphones in Washington Square Park. The fancy devices that promise to cancel noise sell for about $549 each.
