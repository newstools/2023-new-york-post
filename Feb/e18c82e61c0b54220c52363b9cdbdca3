It’s a match! Fashion moguls Tom and Ruth Chapman, founders of the clothing retailer MatchesFashion, have sold their historic West Village townhouse at 252 W. 12th St. for $23.14 million. Last month, Gimme Shelter reported that the highly designed spread had entered contract. The transaction has not yet entered city finance records — and it’s not immediately clear who the new owners are. This sale comes some six months after the fashionistas listed the property for $25 million, with listing broker Carl Gambino, of Compass. The buyers’ broker was Cindy Scholz, also of Compass. The Chapmans purchased the five-bedroom, red brick home for $19 million in 2017 from oil heiress Aileen Getty. Getty bought the home, also for $19 million, from Adam Dell, who shares a child with food personality Padma Lakshmi — and is the brother of the computer mogul Michael Dell. Features inside the spread include a gym, a screening/family room, wine storage, an eat-in chef’s kitchen, a chic living room with a woodburning fireplace and a main bedroom that takes up the whole third floor. The outdoor space features a landscaped roof terrace, a hot tub and a stone-paved rear garden. Built in 1910, the home was renovated by architect Steven Harris, who gutted the interiors and added light to brighten up the 20-foot-wide residence.
