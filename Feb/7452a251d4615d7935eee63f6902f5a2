A woman has been left devastated after a $66 cake for her baby shower arrived looking nothing like the photo. The mom, who is expecting her third child, ordered a dessert made from cupcakes featuring a fondant top in the shape of baby body shirt. But instead she received what was described as a ‘cheaper’ version of the advertised cake. The woman wrote on Facebook that she was “crying” after the whole experience. “My baby shower is tomorrow,” she wrote. Social media users were split on the situation. Some thought she was overreacting but another user noted it was a “very simple and they completely butchered it”. A dessert fail by another woman has also left the internet in stitches after she shared a video of the cake she received for her mom and dad’s 30th wedding anniversary. The woman, a nurse called Megan Turner, told her followers through tears and laughter, that she requested an elegant sponge cake in the shape of ‘30’ with icing on top and decorations. Instead she received a cake that barely resembled what she had in mind. Rather than looking like the number ‘30’ the ‘3’ looked like a sideways ‘m’ and the ‘O’ didn’t even have a hole in the middle. The video has been viewed by over two million people. Social media viewers were shocked. One said she would be asking for her money back while another said she “wouldn’t have taken it or paid for it”. Another summed it when she said: “This is so much worse than what I was expecting.”
