Florence Pugh has skills that go beyond acting. Pugh, 27, showed off her contortionist skills as her “party trick” in a new video for Vanity Fair. The “Don’t Worry Darling” star twisted her limbs to move a stick between her legs and behind her head without letting go once. “It doesn’t really have a name,” Pugh, who was sporting a black leotard and leg warmers, said. “But it’s…if you got a broom and you’re bored, have some fun.” She gave step-by-step instructions in the video, explaining that the “whole idea” is that you’re holding onto the stick the whole time — but if you do it any other way, it’s not going to work. Pugh shared that she discovered this trick when she saw someone do it on a contortionist show. “It’s a good party trick afterwards to be like, ‘Give it a go,’” she quipped. “Because then you just see people, like, nearly break their shoulders and stuff.” Pugh was asked if she remembered the last time she did this trick in front of an audience, and she shared how she did it with a broom. “I ended up pushing my skirt over my head, and I mooned everyone,” she remembered. “I don’t take this to events,” Pugh laughed. “I’m not like, ‘Hey, you got a stick? I need to impress some people in this room. Maybe I should.'” She also showed how she can go into a crab pose and easily stand up out of it. The party trick video corresponds with Vanity Fair’s 29th annual Hollywood issue, which also features Selena Gomez, Austin Butler, Jonathan Majors and Ana de Armas. Pugh was recently spotted with a new potential love interest after splitting with Zach Braff last year.
