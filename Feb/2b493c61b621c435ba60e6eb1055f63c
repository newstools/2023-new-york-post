Readers, have you heard of this thing? An iPad? It’s like somewhere in between an iPhone and a laptop. A tablet computer, they’re calling it. Some of those kooks down at Apple HQ must’ve been firing on all cylinders when they dreamt up the idea. They make new iPads every year, each with new features and optimizations. That means, however, that models on perfectly good, brand-new iPads from a few years ago tend to go on sale. One such sale? This 2021 256GB 10.2″ iPad, currently sitting at its lowest price ever offered on Amazon. Yes, you read that right, 256GB of storage space, a sleek, silver design, touch ID, a 10.2″ retina display with True Tone, and the cherry on top: the A13 Bionic chip with neural engine, all of which could be yours for under $400 this week from Amazon. The tech geniuses at Apple really broke the mold when they made the first iPad, and every one since. But it appears that their marketing time are the real loose canons of Apple. Because this deal is frankly absurd. We recommend you snag it before they reconsider. Save 17% on this 2021 256GB 10.2″ iPad, and own for youself of the most versatile computers on the market. Whether you’ll primarily be using it for work, drawing, writing, or gaming, this high-powered, sturdy tablet, with up to 10 hours of battery life, is a smart investment.
