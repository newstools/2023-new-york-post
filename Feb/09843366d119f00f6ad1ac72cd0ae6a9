The opening night festivities for Super Bowl 2023 got off to a cringeworthy start Monday. As Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni fielded questions during his media availability at the Footprint Center in Arizona, the conversation took an unexpected turn to his young daughter, Taylor. When asked who on the Eagles roster he wouldn’t let date his daughter, Sirianni replied, “My daughter is 5 years old.” It is unclear if the reporter’s line of questioning continued, though it’s hard to believe that Sirianni would entertain such a topic — especially as he and the Eagles prepare to face the Chiefs at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Siranni’s daughter has stolen the spotlight in recent weeks, beginning with her cameo at Sirianni’s postgame press conference last month after the Eagles won the NFC Championship. Taylor wasn’t the least bit shy during the media session, where she was joined by brothers Jacob, 7, and Miles, 2, as she playfully mocked her dad and made hand gestures as Sirianni spoke about Philadelphia’s dominant 31-7 win over the San Francisco 49ers. In now-viral videos, Taylor can be seen making faces and mouthing words at the media while flailing her arms in the air. When Sirianni noticed, he paused, looked over at his daughter and said, “Taylor, stop it.” At that point, the 41-year-old Sirianni already had his hands full with son Miles on his lap and Jacob sitting beside him. When the family arrived at the press conference, Sirianni instructed Taylor to stand, to which she said, “I don’t want to stand.” Jacob then gave up his seat for his little sister. “You’re gonna let Taylor sit? My man. Good job,” Sirianni said to his son, before telling reporters: “[He] gave up a seat for his little sister. That was pretty special.” Sirianni celebrated the NFC Championship win with his kids by making confetti snow angels on the field at Lincoln Financial. Sirianni shares Taylor, Jacob, and Miles with his wife, Brett, whom he has been married to since 2013, per The Sun.
