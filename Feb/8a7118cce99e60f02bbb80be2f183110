It’s the purr-fect way to dishonor an ex. To celebrate Valentine’s Day, the Animal Friends and Humane Society in Hamilton, Ohio, is accepting donations from individuals to buy cat litter boxes and name them after its donors’ ex-partners. “Do you have a crappy ex? … For a $5 donation we will write your ex’s name in a litterbox and give it to the cats, to let them do what they do best!” the shelter wrote on Facebook. Donations are being accepted in-person and via online payment service Venmo, where users can simply add the poop emoji and their ex’s name in its comments section. Facebook users seemed to think the idea was the cat’s meow — and expressed their support with comments like, “I feel like this is the sort of petty you need to highlight” and “Is it $5 PER ex’s name? Asking for a friend.” Others didn’t get the joke. “I am all for making money and helping pets but this is a terrible idea. It is quite childish. I can’t believe your organization is OK with this,” hissed one disgruntled user. On Valentine’s Day, the nonprofit, whose mission is “to protect lost, homeless, abandoned and mistreated animals,” will post a video to reveal the submissions.
