GLENDALE, Ariz. — The Eagles started Super Bowl Sunday with a loss. Maybe two. Hours before Super Bowl 2023 was set to kick off against the Chiefs, the Eagles learned that their coaching staff for next season likely will not remain intact as the Colts are zeroing in on offensive coordinator Shane Steichen as their next head coach, per reports. The Colts reportedly informed last season’s interim head coach Jeff Saturday – one of their all-time great players and a close friend of owner Jim Irsay – that he was out of the running as of Sunday. Giants defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, who interviewed twice, received the same message a few days ago. If the Colts hire Steichen, he will be the second-straight offensive coordinator pulled from the Eagles. Frank Reich, who was hired on the heels of helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl in 2018 after an agreement with then-Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels fell through, was fired in the middle of last season and now is the Panthers head coach. Steichen, 37, oversaw an offense ranked third in yards per game (389.1) and points per game (28.1). The Eagles also could be on the verge of losing defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, who will interview Monday with the Cardinals. The other two finalists in Arizona are Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka and Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, but neither of them was hired this week, which suggested a wait to talk with a coach whose team is still playing. With Eagles-Chiefs in the Cardinals’ home stadium, Gannon, 40, easily could stay behind and interview in-person, though his team’s 70 sacks in the regular season and his defense’s performance against Patrick Mahomes might have more sway than anything he says in a meeting room. The Cardinals and Colts have the last two remaining head coach vacancies.
