If only he stood a chance. One grandpa on TikTok was excited for his first dinner date in 30 years, but he got stood up. Joe Allington, 89, who goes by the username @grandadjoe1933 on the social media app, went viral after he filmed the ordeal, reaching more than 1.1 million views on the video. Allington lost his wife in 2009, according to the BBC, and lives with his daughter and their family. In the beginning of the eight-second clip, Allington shows himself styling his hair and getting ready for the date in front of a gold mirror. “Come with me on my first dinner date in 30 years!” he wrote in white text over the top of the video. The clip then cut to a shot of him sitting at the restaurant, where he wrote that he was “waiting patiently.” At the end of the video, Allington can be seen sighing and looking extremely defeated with an empty plate of food in front of him. “Waited an hour, she didn’t show up so I just ate alone ,” he wrote. The Post reached out to Allington for comment. However, it was his date’s loss, as many viewers rushed to the comments section of the video to give him words of encouragement and kind messages. “Some people are just inconsiderate,” one user wrote. “Good riddance. You deserve someone kind .” Another person asked, “Who would leave you hanging? You’re such a beautiful soul. I’m so sorry..” “You are so handsome, who would leave such a kind man waiting for you at a restaurant?” someone else typed. “I hope your not sad!” Others gave the date the benefit of the doubt, suggesting that she may have just “forgot” about the meeting. “Maybe she simply forgot ,” one hypothesized. Someone else proposed, “Noo, hopefully it wasn’t to be purposefully mean. Maybe they had an emergency come up?”
