The Atlanta Hawks are trying to end their coaching search as quickly as possible. The team has begun discussing their vacant head coaching job with former Jazz head coach Quin Snyder and “are attempting to hire Snyder swiftly,” according to The Athletic. Snyder met virtually with Hawks brass on Wednesday, per the report, while the 56-year-old was out of the country. The Hawks fired Nate McMillan on Tuesday after entering the All-Star break at a disappointing 29-30, which leaves them in the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference. Atlanta reached the Eastern Conference final two seasons ago. Assistant Joe Prunty took over as the interim head coach. While the Hawks have eyed several candidates — including former Celtics coach Ime Udoka, according to Marc Stein — The Athletic reports Atlanta is zeroing in on Snyder, who resigned from his Jazz post in June after eight seasons as the team was transitioning to a rebuild. Snyder led the Jazz to the playoffs in each of his last six seasons in Utah, but they never got past the second round. He spent one season as an assistant with the Hawks before being hired by the Jazz in 2014. The other candidates the Hawks have considered, according to The Athletic, are former Nets coach and current Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson, Bucks assistant Charles Lee, Kings assistant Jordi Fernandez, Spurs assistant Mitch Johnson and Miles Simon, the head coach of the Lakers’ G League affiliate.
