He believed in him-selfie. Bollywood star Akshay Kumar broke a world record for most selfies taken with 184 fans in just three minutes, according to Guinness World Records. The actor, who has over 64 million followers on Instagram, beat out previous record holder James Smith, who shot 168 selfies in 2018, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who snapped 105 selfies at the world premiere of his film “San Andreas” in 2015. Kumar, 55, who is listed by Forbes as one of the highest-paid actors in the world, posted a video of the record-breaking event, which took place at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai. The prolific actor, who has starred in over 100 films, took on the challenge by standing in between two lines of his fans, who approached him from alternating sides, quickly darting in and out. He attempted the record to promote his upcoming film “Selfiee,” which opened on Feb. 24. The National Film Awards winner, who donated $4.5 million to India for COVID relief, credited his supporters for the achievement. “Everything I have achieved and where I am in life is due to the unconditional love of my fans,” he said. “This is my special tribute to them, acknowledging how they have stood by me throughout my career.”
