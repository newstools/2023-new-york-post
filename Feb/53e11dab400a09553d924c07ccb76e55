Old Hollywood relics from the estate of legendary actor Gregory Peck, including his copy of the script for “To Kill a Mockingbird,” are up for auction this month. On Feb. 23, Heritage Auctions is hosting Property from The Estate of Veronique and Gregory Peck, an event to sell off artifacts that once belonged to the late actor and his wife, a journalist and philanthropist whom he married in 1955. Among the close to 250 offerings are Peck’s 1962 leather-bound “Mockingbird” script, for which he won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of lawyer Atticus Finch. It is expected to sell for between $8,000 and $10,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter. There is also a 35th-anniversary copy of the bestselling novel inscribed by its author and Peck’s close friend, Harper Lee. The needlepoint Lee gifted him for his birthday is also among the lots. Three guestbooks kept by the couple, signed by famous names like Frank and Barbara Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Gene Kelly, Charlton Heston, Elizabeth Taylor, Sidney Poitier, Quincy Jones, former French President Jacques Chirac and Michael Jackson, are also up for sale. Other personalized screenplays owned by the five-time Academy Award nominee, who died in 2003, are up for grabs, such as “Roman Holiday,” “Duel in the Sun,” “Spellbound,” “Cape Fear” and “The Omen.” The California native’s custom-made suit from “The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,” two Golden Globe Awards and a poker table, chairs and chips given to him by the Sinatras, and an array of artwork, props, and decorative and personal items are also included in the lots.
