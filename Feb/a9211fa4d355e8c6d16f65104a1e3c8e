Patti LaBelle is ready to get her “gitchi gitchi ya-ya da-da” back in action. The 78-year-old icon revealed on the “Jennifer Hudson Show” that she wants to start dating again. “I’m too good to be solo,” the “Lady Marmalade” songstress declared. The Godmother of Soul even has a potential suitor on her roster. “I do have a nice person in mind, but that’s my personal business,” LaBelle said on Wednesday. Previously, she was married for 32 years to Armstead Edwards, a former high school vice principal turned tour manager whom she regards as a “wonderful man.” The two have a son together, Zuri Kyle Edwards, 49. But the biggest challenge for the “If Only You Knew” singer is finding a love who helps her maintain her “happiness.” With Valentine’s Day around the corner, Hudson asked the queen of sweet potato pies, “Do you ever do dating apps?” LaBelle perked up with interest wanting to know, “What are dating apps?” but once Hudson explained, she dismissed it, saying, “Oh that stuff, I’ve seen that commercial.” The two-time Grammy winner has never been concerned that she won’t be able to find a partner as she continues aging with grace. “My life is so good that a lot of men admire me,” she told The Post in 2019. “They try to look at me like that and I say, ‘Bye Felicia, Bye.'” But within the last two years, her outlook on dating has changed. In 2021, she told Page Six that the special person in her life was her dog, “His name is Mr. Cuddles, he’s my Shih Tzu.” The singer explained she was not actively looking for a romantic partner at the time. “It’s going to fall, when it falls, you know? I’ll know when it’s right,” she said. Eventually, LaBelle will find “The Right Kinda Lover.”
