It’s show time! A small-town three-screen movie theater that comes with four apartments above — and even some retail space — has hit the market for $1 million. Located in Hutchinson, Minnesota, an hour outside of downtown Minneapolis, the unique listing stands on 3 acres. The apartments, described as “luxury suites,” come with one bedroom, one bathroom and laundry. “The sellers bought it years ago when it was in really rough shape,” Jenna Vikse with Jane Vikse Real Estate told The Post. “He said there was a whole in the ceiling the size of a Volkswagen.” “They re-did the entire building and built apartments above the one smaller theater and above the lobby,” Vikse said. “It has three screens in it and the best popcorn around. Excellent property! 3-car garage too!” Built back in 1937, the building’s two retail spaces currently house a hair salon along with a 1,600-square-foot unfinished vacant area, which is temporarily being used as a storage space. “It could be a fabulous store front, theater expansion or bonus area of your choice,” the listing notes. In total, the property spans roughly 12,500 square feet. The buyer has the option of living in the apartments and renting out the others, making this a prime commercial real estate investment, in addition to the revenue the movie theater generates. Other features include an elevator and a rooftop deck. Hutchinson is known as a growing town due to its proximity to the city and people who are drawn to the small-town charm.
