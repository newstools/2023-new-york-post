Jackson Mahomes’ Super Bowl 2023 odyssey shows no signs of slowing down. The 22-year-old younger brother of Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and social media star posted one of his signature dancing TikTok videos from the Chiefs’ championship parade on Wednesday. It does not appear he was able to get on to any of the team’s floats as they rolled through Kansas City. He also posted several images to his Instagram account and story of him celebrating with the crowd and with his brother — who wore his WWE championship belt —  took pictures with fans and appeared to give the Lombardi Trophy to the crowd. The younger Mahomes sibling drew plenty of cringe during the Super Bowl, when he posted selfies from a bathroom in a suite at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., and when he celebrated the Chiefs’ come-from-behind 38-35 win over the Eagles. He was caught dancing in the background of Patrick’s postgame interview on NFL Network before realizing he was in the shot and backing away. Jackson, who has over 1 million followers on TikTok, has found himself at the center of criticism during his brother’s rise to stardom, getting chastised for dancing on the field when the Washington franchise honored the late Sean Taylor in October 2021. He was also accused of acting entitled when trying to get a large group of people seated at a Kansas City cocktail bar in 2021. Despite the rebukes, Jackson Mahomes has support from high up in the Chiefs organization. “I think Patrick Mahomes has a wonderful family – from Brittany to Jackson,” Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt told Fox News Digital ahead of Super Bowl 2023. “They are wonderful people and we are so blessed to have them as part of our organization and are huge rocks in Patrick’s life. “I do think that we live in a culture that’s often quick to criticize and slow to forgive. But I think we need to be one that’s quick to forgive and slow to criticize.”
