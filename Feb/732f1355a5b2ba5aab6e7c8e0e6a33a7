Terry Bradshaw and Jimmy Johnson had jokes. After Rihanna slayed her performance at halftime of Super Bowl 2023 at State Farm Stadium, the Fox NFL crew had a quick reaction before a block of commercials. Host Curt Menefee said that he spied Jimmy Johnson dancing. “I was bouncing up and down,” Johnson admitted. “That’s about all the rhythm I’ve got.” Terry Bradshaw complained that Michael Strahan got to meet Rihanna — Strahan interviewed her in a taped segment for the Super Bowl pregame show — but he did not. “I wanted to meet her. How come Mike got to meet her, but I didn’t get to meet her?” Bradshaw asked. Strahan, who has been to outer space, said that the high-floating stages Rihanna and her dancer performed on would’ve been a bridge too far. “I would’ve been lost. I’m not good with heights, so I wouldn’t have been somebody on stage,” Strahan said. “They would’ve had to keep me on the ground dancing in one of those suits.” Rihanna performed a number of hits, including “Diamonds,” “Umbrella,” “All of the Lights,” “Run This Town,” and “Bitch Better Have My Money.”
