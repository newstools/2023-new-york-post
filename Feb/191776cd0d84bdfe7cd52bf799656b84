Who was doubting them? Whoever they were, Travis Kelce made sure to scream loud enough for them to hear. The superstar Chiefs tight end didn’t spare any language, either, in the moments directly after Kansas City beat the Eagles 38-35 to win Super Bowl 2023. As Patrick Mahomes — who was named Super Bowl MVP after carrying the Chiefs on one leg — made way for Kelce in their postgame interview on the field with Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews, the tight end let out a scream similar to the one Kevin Garnett unleashed after the Celtics won the 2008 NBA Finals. After his scream, Kelce directed his attention on the Chiefs’ apparent doubters. “Not one of y’all said the Chiefs were gonna take it home this year,” Kelce shouted. “Not a single one.” The audio was then cut out on Fox’s broadcast due to Kelce cursing. He appeared to say “feel that s–t,” before the audio returned to pick up him saying “feel it, and on top of that the next time the Chiefs say something, put some respect on our name.” Despite not being favored in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs were one of the NFL’s biggest favorites entering the season, as well as during the playoffs. And although he was slightly more serene than Kelce next to him, Mahomes also forced the Fox broadcast to censor him after cursing in the interview with Andrews. “It didn’t come from one person,” Mahomes said. “Our defense played their ass off in that second half. And our offense found a way. Man, I just wanna thank everybody.” As Mahomes began to say “everybody on this team, we battled through…,” the audio cut off, and as it returned he could be heard saying “pardon my language.” Mahomes threw for 182 passing yards and three touchdowns, while Kelce hauled in six receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown. It was their second Super Bowl victory together. And if they’re doubted again going forward, Kelce will seemingly meet it with a scream.
