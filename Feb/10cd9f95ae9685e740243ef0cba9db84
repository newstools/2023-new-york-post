Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Matthews’ 2-year-old daughter added Chanel to her designer bag collection. The Chiefs quarterback and the fitness entrepreneur gifted their firstborn, Sterling Syke, a mini Chanel purse for her second birthday on Monday. Matthews took to her Instagram Story to share a video of Sterling sitting on her dad’s lap while they helped her open the black and white package, which featured a Chanel signature ribbon. “Did you get a new purse?” Matthews can be heard saying in the clip as Mahomes held up the quilted black bag. The two-time Super Bowl MVP then placed it on her wrist, though, Sterling appeared more intrigued by the piece of toast she was eating. The Chanel purse featured a pink interior and a mini flap with a top handle. It appears nearly identical to the brand’s all-pink mini bag from its spring-summer 2023 pre-collection — which costs $4,800. The purse is the latest addition to Sterling’s designer bag collection, which also includes a Jacquemus mini bag she wore in September during the Chiefs’ 27-24 win against the Chargers on “Thursday Night Football.” At the time, Matthews and Sterling rocked “mommy and me” Jacquemus bags in red and gold to support the Chiefs. It was a birthday to remember for Sterling, who enjoyed a day out with her mom and dad. “We went to the zoo today for her actual birthday,” Matthews wrote on her Instagram Story Monday, including a photo of Mahomes carrying Sterling to an animal exhibit. The family wore matching sneakers from Mahomes’ Adidas line in the blue and white colorway, “Family Time,” which was inspired by Sterling’s second birthday. Mahomes and Matthews recently threw their daughter a dessert-themed party with signs that read “Sterling Two Sweet” and a variety of pink-colored treats. Her baby brother, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, whom Matthews and Mahomes welcomed in November, was also present, according to photos from the party. Guests at the event enjoyed a donut bar, where they designed their own donuts with frosting and toppings, as well as a custom coffee bar. The party also included kid-friendly activities, such as a bounce house, a slide, blow-up donut toys, and decorated areas to take photos. Sterling’s cake was made out of mini donuts and had a No. 2 candle topper. “My baby girl is a whole 2 years old! 🥹 I can’t even believe it,” Matthews wrote on Instagram in a birthday tribute to Sterling. “These have been some of the best years of my life being your mama Sterling Skye! You make everyday a good day!  Now please stop growing up.” The Mahomes family has had a whirlwind month after the quarterback led the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory over the Eagles in Super Bowl 2023 on Feb. 12. Mahomes — who was named NFL MVP this past season — celebrated with his wife and teammates at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade in downtown Kansas City on Wednesday. The couple will celebrate their first wedding anniversary next month after they tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Hawaii last year.
