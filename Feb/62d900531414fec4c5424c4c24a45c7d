Steelers receiver Diontae Johnson fought back against the notion that he punched quarterback Mitchell Trubisky in the face. Speaking in Glendale, Arizona, during Super Bowl week on Friday, Gregg Giannotti, who co-hosts “Boomer and Gio” with Boomer Esiason on WFAN, brought up a report about an alleged halftime altercation between Trubisky and Johnson during Week 4 against the Jets. The alleged confrontation occurred in the locker room, where the receiver was apparently upset over his lack of targets during Pittsburgh’s 24-20 loss against Gang Green. The analyst claimed the fight was the reason behind Trubisky being replaced by rookie Kenny Pickett in the second half. After the loss, Pickett started over Trubisky for the rest of the season. Both Trubisky and Johnson shot down the resurfaced rumors on Twitter, though, with the receiver saying it was “fake news.” Johnson previously addressed the confrontation in October and said the two did argue, but the teammates were on good terms. “Stuff happens during football,” Johnson said to reporters after the confrontation. “We’re fine, we talked about it. We made up, better over the whole situation. No hard feelings towards each other. That’s still my guy at the end of the day. “I’m gonna still keep playing for him, cheering for him. Whatever it is that he needs me to do to help him look good out there, I’mma do it. Like I said, there’s no bad blood between us at all. It’s just us being football players at times and we’re not gonna let that stop us from achieving the goal that everybody is trying to achieve around here.” The Steelers, who are currently transitioning from the Ben Roethlisberger era, failed to make the playoffs this season with a 9-8 record.
