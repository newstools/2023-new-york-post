Porn actress Angela White almost died after filming a brutal hourlong sex scene with a well-endowed co-star. The Aussie actress, 37, was hospitalized with a burst appendix following the frisky shoot, which purportedly took place in 2013. The shocking claim was made by Keiran Lee, the adult entertainer who was working with White at the time. “I put her into hospital and this was actually not on purpose,” Lee, 39, told The Pillow Talk podcast on Tuesday. The male star — whose nine-and-a-half inch member is insured for $1 million — stated, “We were shooting content and… we were going at it for over an hour. After that, I‘m like ‘See you sweetheart, lovely day.'” “I found out two days later she’d gone back home to Australia,” he continued. “She said her stomach was hurting and she had to go see a doctor – apparently her appendix burst in the scene, which could have killed her.” White — who has previously been described as “the Meryl Streep of porn” —  was not featured on the podcast. The Post has reached out to White for confirmation of Lee’s claim. However, the porn star has previously opened up about having her appendix removed. In 2016, the Sydney-born starlet penned a post to social media about undergoing the procedure three years earlier, according to The Sun. “They had to make an incision above my pubic bone and at my hip,” White reportedly wrote. “The scarring was minimal and the recovery was pretty fast (I did a porn expo 4 days after surgery).” The medical episode didn’t deter White from getting frisky with Lee again, as the pair gave gone on to star in several more scenes together. White — who is the only woman to have won AVN’s Female Performer of the Year three times — remains one of the world’s most prominent pornstars.
