Good oral hygiene is the key to a healthy smile, and the Aquasonic Duo series of electric toothbrushes is here to help. Right now, you can get your hands on a 2-Pack of Aquasonic Dual Handle Ultra Whitening Toothbrushes for a whopping 43% off on Amazon. Even at the full $70, the Aquasonic Duo toothbrush 2-Pack is already a steal. But with this discount taking that total to $40 for both, it’s practically a steal-and-a-half. And don’t be fooled by the low price – this toothbrush has plenty of high-end features. For starters, it’s got a powerful motor that delivers up to 40,000 vibrations per minute. That’s a lot of scrubbing power to remove plaque and whiten teeth. And with the included wireless charging base, you won’t have to deal with messy cords or frequent battery changes. But what really sets the Aquasonic Duo apart is its dual-handle design. This toothbrush comes with two brush handles, so you can share it with a partner or keep one at home and one at the office. Each handle has three different modes — clean, soft, and massage — so you can customize your brushing experience. The brush heads are made with Dupont bristles, known for their durable yet gentle cleaning power. Best of all, the Aquasonic Duo is backed by a two-year warranty, so you can rest assured that you’re making a solid investment in your oral health.
