It’s been a big weekend for LSU’s superstar gymnast, Olivia Dunne. Days after the Tigers posted a season-high road score for a win Friday against Alabama, the social media sensation took to her Instagram Stories on Sunday to share that she was spending time with the team’s “newest recruit,” fellow influencer Katie Sigmond. In a photo posted to her page, the 20-year-old Dunne can be seen posing at the gym with Sigmond, who boasts more than three million Instagram followers. Sigmond also shared a pic of the influential duo on her own Instagram Story. “Oh hey @livvydunne,” Sigmond captioned the shot from the Tigers’ dressing room. Although Dunne didn’t post any videos of her exchange with Sigmond on TikTok, where she has 7.2 million followers, the New Jersey native did share a clip of her gymnastics return from Friday after being sidelined due to injury. “Back to business,” Dunne wrote alongside a video of herself on the bars, where she recorded a score of 9.825. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Dunne quipped about LSU’s 197.975-197.925 win over Alabama: “They’ve always said the bars at Bama were fun…” Regarded as one of the most influential college athletes, Dunne’s fame has continued to skyrocket in recent months, with fans showing up to support her at meets. In the wake of a wild scene that unfolded in January, when unruly fans chanted for the gymnast throughout the contest, Dunne asked supporters to “be respectful” of the gymnastics community. “I will always appreciate and love the support from you guys, but if you come to a meet, I want to ask you to please be respectful of the other gymnasts and the gymnastics community as we are just doing our job,” she tweeted at the time. Fans obeyed Dunne’s wishes during a meet against Georgia weeks later. LSU will face California, Washington, and George Washington on Friday, March 3.
