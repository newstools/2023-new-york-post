A baseball bat-wielding Harvard law student was arrested last month for targeting a classmate in a racist and homophobic on-campus attack, authorities said. Naod Nega, 27, was charged with assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation on Jan. 23 — a hate crime under Massachusetts state law — and pleaded not guilty, the Harvard Crimson reported. Nega allegedly hurled homophobic and racist slurs at a classmate and threateningly wielded a baseball bat outside the law school library. “The male…punched a college student in an unprovoked attack, and intimidated them due to their sexual orientation, the Cambridge Police Department said in a statement, Following the unhinged attack, Nega was involuntarily brought to a local hospital, where he assaulted at least five male employees, according to Cambridge police. “The male was initially sectioned to a local hospital on Monday, January 23rd after he was threatening students on campus with a baseball bat, used racial slurs, punched a college student in an unprovoked attack, and intimidated them due their sexual orientation,” a press release from police read. According to the police report, Nega had previously been involved in numerous incidents involving “aggressive and violent behavior.” He’s currently on leave from Harvard Law School, the school’s newspaper reported. Assistant dean Monica E. Monroe and dean of students Stephen L. Ball blasted out an email to students later the same day, condemning the horrifying assault. “We condemn unconditionally all violence, hatred, and homophobia, and will continue to work to foster a campus in which members of our Law School and University community feel welcome, safe, and included,” they wrote. After Nega pleaded not guilty at a Jan. 27 arraignment, a judge ordered that he undergo treatment and evaluation at Bridgewater State Hospital. Nega’s next hearing is Thursday.
