The military should stop selling guns to troops under the age of 25, in a bid to help combat suicide, an independent Pentagon panel found. The Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) was formed in March 2020 to address the rising rates of suicides by members of the armed forces. “On DoD property, raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition to 25 years,” the committee wrote in their report, which was released Friday, Fox News reported. SPRIRC called the suggestion “high priority” and said the situation was something that “must change.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.
