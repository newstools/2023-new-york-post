A woman was arrested Monday for an alleged crime spree that included setting a pride flag on fire outside of a Soho restaurant and vandalizing two NYPD cars, police said. Angelina Cando, 35, was hit with hate crime charges and other offenses over the two incidents from Sunday night into early Monday morning, cops said. Cando allegedly set fire to the rainbow flag hanging outside the Little Prince restaurant on Prince Street near MacDougal Street in Manhattan around 1:30 a.m. Monday, cops said. The fire damaged part of the outside of the building before it was extinguished by the firefighters. She was charged with arson as a hate crime, criminal mischief as a hate crime and reckless endangerment as a hate crime. Cando also allegedly scrawled “Jesus is King” on the back of two NYPD patrol cars parked on Varick Street between Ericson Place and North Moore Street Sunday night, police said. For that crime, she was slapped with criminal mischief for possession of graffiti tools. The arrests are the latest of several for Cando this year, cops said. She was arrested in January for assault and in February for menacing, sources said.
