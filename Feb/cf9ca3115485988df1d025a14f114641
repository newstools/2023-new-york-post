Simone Biles is ready to celebrate. Taking to Instagram on Thursday, the seven-time Olympic medalist gave followers an inside look at her bachelorette party in Belize ahead of her upcoming wedding to Texans safety Jonathan Owens. “The one where I’m the bride,” the 25-year-old Biles captioned a festive snap as she posed beside bridal-themed goodies, including a “Future Mrs. Owens” sash. The gold-medal gymnast also revealed that Owens surprised her with a white Chanel bag for the festivities. “The sweetest surprise from my future husband,” Biles shared. In separate posts on her Instagram Story, Biles revealed that she and her pals kicked off the weekend with a “pajama party game night.” Biles announced her engagement to Owens last February, with the Texans pro presenting his future wife with a dazzling oval-cut diamond ring. “THE EASIEST YES,” Biles gushed on Instagram at the time. “I can’t wait to spend forever & ever with you, you’re everything I dreamed of and more! let’s get married FIANCÉ.” Biles, who has supported Owens at Texans games throughout their relationship, previously opened up about the early days of their romance in a 2022 interview with the “Today” show. “We clicked really really well in the beginning because we’re athletes and we have the same busy schedules. But other than that, since it was kind of a COVID relationship, we’re with each other 24/7, so I feel like now when we’re not with each other it’s almost weird,” Biles said of Owens, whom she connected with on Instagram in March 2020. Though it remains to be seen when Biles and Owens will officially tie the knot, she said “yes to the dress(es)” last summer. As for Owens, he recently completed his fourth season in Houston. He is set to become a free agent.
