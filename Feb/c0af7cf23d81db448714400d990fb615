A heartless mugger threw a 64-year-old woman to the ground as he snatched her purse in the lobby of a Brooklyn building over the weekend, cops said. The victim was approached by a stranger from behind in the building on East 34th Street near Church Avenue in East Flatbush at 6:40 a.m. Sunday, police said. The creep then latched onto the bag she was carrying on her shoulder. The woman struggled with the thief â€” but he managed to yank the bag from her clutches and threw her to the ground, cops said. As the suspect ran out of the lobby, he slammed the front door against the victim, who was still on the ground, authorities said. He then took off, heading north on Church Avenue. The victim was taken to Kingsbrook Jewish Hospital, where she was listed in stable condition with injuries to her back and leg. Her stolen purse held a wallet, $80 cash, credit cards and personal identification. Cops released a surveillance image of the suspect early Wednesday.
