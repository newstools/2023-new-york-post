It’s not a blank space. People hoping to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Manchester, England, for $1,260 a month have to keep a cardboard cutout of Taylor Swift in the home. The red dress-wearing 2-D Taylor in the window has brought train travelers joy as they pass by the “Taylor Tram” pad. When tenant Red Redmond announced they were moving out, commuters couldn’t shake off concern they would no longer be able to wave at the figure they have come to know all too well, Jam Press reports. But Redmond, a comedian, advised gorgeous gawkers they need to calm down. The pop star would stay right where she was in the window. The enchanting cutout has been overlooking the Metrolink route from Cornbrook to the City Centre for five years — since Redmond brought it home on the train after a night out in Sheffield. Listening to the public outcry, estate agents advised prospective tenants the singer “must stay in place.” “Join in on the online Manchester sensation that has been providing tram commuters happiness each morning,” the listing notes. With exception of the stand-up Swift, the apartment comes unfurnished. Features include two bedrooms, an en-suite bathroom and a balcony. ”Reeds Rains are extremely excited to market one of Manchester’s most iconic apartments for the very first time, the infamous Tram Taylor that has been greeting commuters for the last five years,” the listing notes. ”Many Mancunians will be familiar with the popular Taylor Swift cutout that welcomes thousands of tram commuters each and every day in this popular waterside development at Vie building.” ”Must be mummified and not discovered until 3,000 years of rent paid,” joked Dave Moore, who lives in Manchester. No word if the new tenants get special access to much coveted Eras tour tickets. If not, it’ll be a cruel summer.
