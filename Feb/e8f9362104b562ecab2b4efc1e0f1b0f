Johnny Knoxville might be getting an angry phone call from Mike White. After the dramatic Season 2 finale of “The White Lotus,” fans have been anxiously waiting for the location of Season 3 to be announced. Season 1 of the show took fans to Hawaii, filmed at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, while Season 2 brought us out of the country to Sicily, on location at the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in the town of Taormina. In a new interview with Vulture, Knoxville, 51, might have accidentally let slip where the next season will take place when talking about his friendship with show creator White, 52. “Mike White is a very close friend of mine. He and I had been in Tokyo together,” he shared. “I think that’s where the next . . . Oh, I’m not giving anything away.” “I might call him again as soon as this is over,” Knoxville added. Before TVLine confirmed the renewal of the HBO Max show that follows guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus hotel chain, White was already thinking about where the next location would be — and hinted at Asia. “I think it’d be fun to maybe go to a whole different continent. You know, we did Europe, and maybe Asia, something crazy like that, that would be fun,” he told Deadline in October 2022. The “Survivor” alum teased more on the potential Season 3 locale in December 2022 in the HBO Max “Unpacking S2 E7” special. “The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,” White said. “I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.” Seasons 1 and 2 of “The White Lotus” are currently streaming on HBO Max.
