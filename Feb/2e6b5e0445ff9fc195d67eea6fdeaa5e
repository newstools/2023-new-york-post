A 35-year-old man was slashed in the face inside a Manhattan bank late Wednesday, cops said. The victim was attacked inside the Capital One Bank on Broadway near East 14th Street â€“ steps from the Union Square subway station, just after 10 p.m., authorities said. A man with a dark complexion, wearing a yellow jacket, black jeans and carrying a suitcase fled on foot in an unknown direction, police said. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The motive for the assault was unknown on Thursday. Cops could not confirm exactly where the slashing occurred inside the bank, which was closed at the time of the attack. Photos from the scene show the lights on in the vestibule, where the ATMs are located.
