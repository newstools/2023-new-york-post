Two bandits threatened Brooklyn smoke shop workers with a hammer and punched one of them before snatching up hundreds of dollars in cash and CBD products, according to cops and video footage. The pair entered the Hubble Bubble smoke shop on Avenue P near East 4th Street in Midwood just after 11 a.m. Feb. 2, cops said this week. Video released late Monday shows the pair speaking to a worker behind the counter, as one appears to point a small object he holdd in his hand, and then walks away. When the worker follows them, one of the suspects scrambles behind the counter, grabbing a hammer. Cops say the creep threatened employees with the hammer and demanded CBD products. The clip then shows the other suspect going behind the counter and scooping up multiple items. The pair also punched a 30-year-old male worker multiple times in the face and body, authorities said. The assault is not shown on camera. The duo got away with about $150 in cash and CBD products valued at around $800, cops said. Both suspects fled on a blue two-wheeled vehicle heading east on Avenue P and then south on East 4th Street, police said. Authorities are looking for the publicâ€™s help in tracking them down. The pummeled employee was treated for pain and bruising at Coney Island Hospital.
