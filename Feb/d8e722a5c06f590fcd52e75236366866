President Joe Biden’s as big and self-serving a liar as George Santos — and about his record, not just his resumé. Asked Friday if he takes any blame for inflation, the prez erupted: “It was already there when I got here, man. Remember what the economy was like when I got here? Jobs were hemorrhaging. Inflation was rising. We weren’t manufacturing a damn thing here.” That’s three whoppers in 20 seconds. Lie #1: “It was already there when I got here, man.” Inflation was 1.4% when Biden took office. By April, after the passage of his $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” giveaway, it hit 4.16%. By June 2022 (after even more runaway spending), it topped 9%. Lie #2: “Jobs were hemorrhaging.” Bull. America lost close to 22 million jobs to lockdown shock in early 2020, but by the end of that year, we’d recovered a bit more than half. Under Biden, the pace slowed massively: It wasn’t until June 2022 that the nation recovered the rest. And that had nothing to do with him. It was the COVID vaccine and end of lockdowns. Lie #3: “We weren’t manufacturing a damn thing here.” Huh? The nation still had millions of manufacturing jobs, despite COVID’s impact. The sector boomed in the Trump years. These rapid-fire lies are so contrary to reality that you have to ask: why? Does our president think that people will believe him if he repeats the malarkey enough?  Or is he such a narcissist that he rewrites reality in his head to feel heroic, and then believes his own lies? Neither gives us faith in our commander in chief.
