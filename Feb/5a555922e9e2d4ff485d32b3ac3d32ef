The subways are a real rat race these days. A dozing commuter on a New York City subway was shaken from his slumber to find one of the large rodents crawling all over his body, a Newsflare video shows. The 20-second footage shows the unidentified straphanger dressed in gray jeans and blue vest being rocked to sleep by the train car. Unbeknownst to him, a mangy rat seizes that moment to race up his leg and onto his shoulders. The rodent-ridden rider then wakes up and puts his hand behind his neck– only to find the rat making its way back down his arm. Evidently disgusted, the man shoots up and the rat falls to the floor before the video cuts out, leaving viewers wondering if the commuter burned his rat-touched clothes or donated them to the Hudson River. The spine-tingling video is just the latest in New York City’s ongoing battle against vermin. According to one recent report, maintenance crews in Battery Park City have even resorted to using dry ice to kill the invasive rodents. “Here in Battery Park City, we’re no stranger to having rodents, and so we wanted to make sure that we were able to manage them while keeping everything chemical-free,” Ryan Torres, vice president of parks operations at the Battery Park City Authority, told The Post of the solution last month. The problem has gotten so bad, not even Mayor’s Adams’ Brooklyn home has been spared. He was slapped with a summons for rodent infestation after an inspector found rat dropping at the Bedford-Stuyvesant address. The situation prompted Adams’ former Republican election opponent, Curtis Sliwa, to respond by bringing cats to his home to battle the rodent menace.
