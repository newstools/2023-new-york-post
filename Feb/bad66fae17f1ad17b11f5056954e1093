Former WWE star Bill Goldberg wasn’t a fan of Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show, and seemingly took issue with her crotch-grab dance move. During a recent episode of his “CarCast” podcast with Matt “The Motorator” D’Andria, Goldberg didn’t hold back when he said he thought Rihanna’s performance was “frickin’ horrible.” “I mean I was disgusted by it. That’s all. Let’s just say that. I thought it was horrible,” Goldberg said, to which D’Andria added that he “wasn’t a fan.” When D’Andria said he thought RiRi’s halftime show was “kinda boring,” Goldberg replied: “That’s the understatement of the year, man.” The pair also agreed that Chris Stapleton’s national anthem performance was good, with Goldberg saying that the country singer “didn’t grab his crotch every 15 seconds.” At one point during her performance, Rihanna did a crotch-grab dance move while singing her hit, “Rude Boy,” which stirred controversy on social media — and apparently had the phones ringing off the hook at WFAN. On Monday, Al Dukes, the executive producer of “Boomer & Carton,” tweeted, “Sports Talk Radio: We are getting more calls on Rihanna’s crotch grab than the actual game.” Taking the crotch grab out of the equation, Rihanna nearly broke the internet when she revealed her baby bump during her halftime show. A representative for the 34-year-old Grammy winner confirmed her second pregnancy shortly after she left the stage. Plenty of fans tuned in to her 13-minute performance at Super Bowl 2023 — which saw the Chiefs defeat the Eagles 38-35 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. Rihanna’s halftime show drew a reported 118.7 million viewers, while the big game pulled in 113 million viewers. It was her first performance since 2018, and her first since giving birth to her and A$AP Rocky’s son in May 2022. The couple has yet to reveal their son’s name. The soon-to-be family of four are the cover stars of British Vogue’s March 2023 issue.
