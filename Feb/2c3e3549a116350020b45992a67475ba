How you smell is a particularly high entry on the list of things that can make or break a date. Per our estimations, we’d place it right under whether or not you were openly insulting, and just above what you came dressed in. Smell bad, and it just might be all over for you. Keep in mind, too, that a date can be anything: an actual date with a romantic prospect, a performance review with your boss, a meeting with the bank to request a loan for your small business, dinner with your wife or family, etc. Luckily, there’s a popular, trustworthy brand of deodorant out there. Even luckier? It’s on sale on Amazon. This week, a 2-Pack of Old Spice Pure Sport Solid Deodorant is 25% off. That means you’ll smell good on dates not just for the span of time it takes you to get through one stick, but two — and that they cost you $4 each. $4 is a very small price to pay for a second date, or a promotion, or a successful loan application, resulting in a successful business, or a wife and family that love you and think that you smell good. Yow know the drill: you put on Old Spice, and you smell good. The meme-loving deodorant company promises high endurance on this Pure Sport stick deodorant, leaving you sweat-free and smelling good for hours after application.
