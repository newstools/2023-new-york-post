One queen will honor the other. Actress Helen Mirren will reportedly honor the late monarch Queen Elizabeth II during the 2023 BAFTA awards on Sunday, according to the award show. “The Queen occupies a unique place in BAFTA’s history, a close association that spanned 50 years,” said the British Academy. “Through her various patronages, The Queen was renowned for her support of the U.K.’s creative industries.” Mirren, 77, famously portrayed the monarch in the 2006 film “The Queen” which gave her an Oscar win. “For fifty years and more, Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty, and her hairstyle.” said the actress in her acceptance speech. “She’s had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she’s weathered many, many storms.” “I salute her courage and her consistency. And I thank her, because if it wasn’t for her, I most, most certainly would not be here.” The longest-reigning monarch passed away in September of 2022 surrounded by family members at Balmoral castle. Upon learning of the Queen’s death, Mirren issued a statement saying that she was “the epitome of nobility.” “I am proud to be an Elizabethan. We mourn a woman, who, with or without the crown, was the epitome of nobility,” said the 77-year-old on Instagram. The 76th annual BAFTA Awards will air on Sunday, Feb. 19 at 2 p.m.
