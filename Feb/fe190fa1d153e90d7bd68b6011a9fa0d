It took awhile, but St. John’s turned the momentum of one of its biggest wins of the season into a second-straight win. The Red Storm outscored DePaul 9-0 in the second overtime and earned a 92-83 win Tuesday night in Chicago. DePaul junior guard Jalen Terry hit a 3-pointer, his only points of the night, with four seconds left in regulation left to give DePaul the lead at 79-76. But junior guard Dylan Addae-Wusu responded for St. John’s, hitting a 3-pointer with .5 remaining. DePaul threw the ensuing inbounds pass out of bounds, allowing St John’s to inbound the ball under the DePaul basket. But Jones missed from the baseline to send game into overtime. The teams went a combined 1 of 13 from the floor in the first overtime that ended tied at 83. Addae-Wusu finished with a career-high 24 points as St. John’s — coming off a 73-68 upset victory over Providence at Madison Square Garden — improved to 16-11 overall, 6-10 in the Big East. It was just the second road win of the season for the Johnnies. Joel Soriano added 21 points and 16 rebounds for St. John’s, while AJ Storr had 14 points and seven rebounds while former Blue Demon David Jones — who recently lost his father, David Apolinar Jones Sr. — added 13 points and four assists off the bench. O’Mar Stanley also chipped in with 10 points. The Blue Demons (9-17, 3-12) lost their seventh straight game. Javan Johnson led DePaul with 26 points. Umoja Gibson added 17 points, Da’Sean Nelson 15 and Nick Ongenda 11. St. John’s, which will be seeking its third consecutive victory, has four remaining games left in the Big East regular season. The Red Storm next play host to No. 18 Creighton on Saturday. The Blue Jays lost 94-86 to No. 24 Providence on Tuesday night. — with Post staff
