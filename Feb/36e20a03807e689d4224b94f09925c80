Your habits don’t just affect the length of your life. Your healthspan is the length of time your body is generally healthy, and you may be able to extend it with a few simple changes. If you want to learn more about your own healthspan, including how to extend it, check out the Humanity Health App while a lifetime subscription is only $129.99 (reg. $299). The Humanity Health app might help you see the big picture when it comes to your health. By connecting a fitness tracker and recording your sleep time, activity, and dietary habits, this app can give you an estimated rate of aging that shows how your decisions might be making your body feel older. All of this is calculated in your Humanity score, and every positive action you do boosts your “H score”. Getting to sleep on time, eating healthy, and exercising are all things you can do to give yourself a little boost. As you improve your H score and start cultivating more healthy habits, you might even notice your mood improving. The real bonus to improving your H score is that you may start to feel healthier in your body and mind. You can even track your daily mood, meditation, and general wellbeing in the app. That doesn’t mean you have to totally stop enjoying junk food or spending a day doing absolutely nothing. It may just make it easier and more fun to start making more healthy decisions. Make sure you can get more out of every day of your life. Increasing your healthspan may improve your quality of life and mood, but first you have to get started. For a limited time, get the Humanity Health App on sale for the best price you’ll find online, just $129.99 (reg. $299). Prices subject to change.
