A young South Carolina mother gunned down in a Kroger’s parking lot allegedly “spit at” the suspect before the fatal shooting, according to a report. Local police chief Bobby Dale told Fox News Digital that witnesses said Alexandria Cress Borys and alleged shooter Christina Harrison got into a heated argument “over who had the right-of-way” in the supermarket’s parking lot before the Valentine’s Day shooting. Borys, 26, who was with her baby and another young child, was putting away groceries when she got into the confrontation with Harrison, who was in her car, according to reports. “According to witnesses, the two exchanged some words and that’s around the time Borys spit at Harrison,” Dale detailed in an email to Fox News. “Borys turned away and was simultaneously shot by Harrison.” It’s unclear if one of the children with Borys was her own child or other relatives. WIS reported that husband Tyler Borys said his wife was shopping with her sister-in-law, niece and nephew leading up to the fatal shooting, but WACH reported the distraught husband said it occurred in front of their 2-year-old child and an infant who were both in the car. A call to Irmo police for clarification was not immediately returned Tuesday evening. Harrison originally fled in her car after the shooting, but later turned herself into police, authorities said. The 23-year-old is facing murder and weapons charges and was booked at Lexington County Detention Center.
