The week got off to a bloody start in New York City when two men were shot just hours apart in Brooklyn and Queens on Monday morning. Police said a 31-year-old man was shot in the right arm in the 700 block of Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn around 8:30 a.m. Law enforcement sources said the victim — whose name was not released publicly Monday —  was the intended target of the shooting, though the motive behind the attack was not immediately disclosed. Police are looking for a male suspect who was last seen wearing an orange construction vest in connection to the shooting. About two hours later, a 30-year-old man walked into Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, suffering from a gunshot wound to his left hand. He was listed in a stable condition. Sources said the victim, whose name was not released, has no criminal history. Additional details about that shooting were not immediately available. According to the latest data from the NYPD, shooting incidents in the Big Apple were down more than 20% as of Feb. 19, compared to the same time a year ago.
