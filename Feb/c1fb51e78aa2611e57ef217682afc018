Emmy Award-winning actress Ellen Barkin’s Greenwich Village townhouse — an 1841 Greek Revival charmer with an addition by the late Louvre Pyramid starchitect I.M. Pei — has sold for $11 million, according to city property records. Barkin’s residence, at 153 W. 12th St., was sold by a trust. The trustee, Blaine Lourd, is a money manager and the younger brother of Creative Artists Agency partner Bryan Lourd. Back in 2017, Barkin — who got her start in 1982’s “Diner” before moving on to star with Al Pacino in “Sea of Love” — fended off a burglar during an attempted home invasion at the property and then tweeted about it. The three-story, 20-foot-wide home is 2,577 square feet. Barkin bought the home, via a trust, for $7.5 million in 2006, following her forced removal from ex-husband Ronald Perelman’s East 63rd Street townhouse. (She had previously been married to actor Gabriel Byrne, with whom she shares two kids.) Barkin once spoke to More magazine about the townhouse: “It’s beautiful,” she said, “but I’d rather have an apartment, quite frankly. I don’t like being responsible for a house. I don’t want to shovel snow. I want to pick up the phone and say, ‘My bathroom is leaking,’ and hang up.” She also said she thought about gardening — for a New York minute. “I’m a New Yorker. I wouldn’t care if I never saw a tree again in my life. I was thinking last year, ‘Maybe I should garden.’ And then I thought, ‘nah.’ ” In 1981, the home was sold to the Cooper Union. By 2002, the school had sold it for $2.6 million to Joseph Bae, a managing director at KKR, then known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Bae renovated and restored the home — including that I.M. Pei-designed 20-foot-deep extension. The dwelling also features a finished basement and an outdoor kitchen. Bae, who had moved to KKR’s Hong Kong office, then sold the townhouse to Barkin. The broker is Jim St. André of Compass, who also sold Barkin’s 74 Fifth Ave. home for $1.75 million in 2021.
