The underperforming Atlanta Hawks are making a coaching change. Nate McMillan has been fired as the team’s head coach, the team announced Tuesday.  Assistant Joe Prunty will take over as interim coach. “I would like to thank Nate for his leadership and professionalism during his time with the Hawks. He is truly a class act, and we appreciate the graciousness and work ethic he brought with him every day,” Hawks GM Landry Fields said. “Decisions like these, especially in-season, are always extremely difficult, but we believe it’s in the best interest of our team to move forward with another voice leading the way.” Former Jazz coach Quin Snyder, Warriors assistant and former Nets coach Kenny Atkinson and Bucks assistant Charles Lee are expected to be targets in the Hawks’ coaching search, ESPN reported. The Hawks are a disappointing 29-30 this season and have not progressed since reaching the Eastern Conference final two years ago. McMillan, 58, took over as interim coach in March of 2021 after Atlanta fired Lloyd Pierce. The Hawks went 27-11 the rest of that season and went on to beat the Knicks and 76ers in the playoffs before falling to the eventual-champion Bucks in six games. Last year, in McMillan’s first full season as the team’s head coach, the Hawks went 43-39 and lost to the top-seeded Heat in the first round. Overall in 19 seasons, McMillan has a 760-668 record with the Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Hawks. The Hawks are currently the No. 8 seed in the East, which would put them into the play-in tournament. They’re 3.5 games behind the Knicks for the No. 6 spot and three games up on the Bulls, who are in 11th place. McMillan was previously the head coach of the SuperSonics, Trail Blazers and Pacers.
