TAMPA — Frankie Montas underwent shoulder surgery Tuesday that is expected to sideline him at least until August, but the Yankees are leaving the door open for a late-season return. Montas had his labrum cleaned up during the procedure, according to manager Aaron Boone, but Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who performed the surgery, did not have to touch the right-hander’s rotator cuff. The result is that Montas will be shut down for 12 weeks before beginning a throwing program in May. Generally the time down is equal to the time needed for a ramp-up, meaning that in a best-case scenario, Montas would need 12 more weeks to be built up — putting his potential return some time in August in a best-case scenario. Montas, who was on the IL with shoulder inflammation shortly before the Yankees acquired him from the Athletics at last year’s trade deadline, is set to be a free agent after this season. In Montas’ absence, Domingo German and Clarke Schmidt are set to battle for the fifth starter job in spring training.
