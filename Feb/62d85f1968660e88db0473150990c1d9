A world-famous YouTuber has “broken the internet” after announcing he is expecting a baby with his internet-star wife. On Sunday, Swedish internet personality Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, revealed to his millions of followers that his wife, Marzia Kjellberg, was pregnant. The couple shared a video titled, “We’re having a baby!” across their respective social media channels, with PewDiePie boasting 111 million subscribers on his YouTube channel alone, while Marzia has an 8.4 million following her on Instagram. “I have been keeping a secret from you guys and that is I am going to be a dad,” PewDiePie says in the video over images of pregnancy tests and ultrasounds. “We found out Marzia is pregnant [on the] first of November and I am just so thankful everything has been going well so far.” The 33-year-old YouTuber said his wife had been “dealing with sickness” but was tackling it all like an “absolute champ”. “So yeah, I am going to be a dad. I am so excited. It is kind of strange to me, it is entering new territory. I feel really ready and so does Marzia,” he said. “I just feel so lucky to start a family with the woman I love and I know whatever is ahead of us, together we can do it.” The video included heartwarming footage of the moment the couple, who married in 2019, found out they were going to be parents, as well as them telling their family and little snippets of Marzia’s pregnancy journey so far. PewDiePie said he was fortunate to have great parents growing up and wanted to be a similar role model for his child. He added that Marzia is the “most loving and caring person I know” so he said he has no doubt she will be an amazing mother. “But I promise to help along the way and be the best dad I can possibly be. I can’t wait to meet this kid,” he said. The video gained more than 680,000 views within the first hour of being uploaded and, at the time of publication, had more than 4.1 million views on YouTube. Thousands of social media commenters have shared their excitement at the news, many of whom have followed the social media personalities for years. “This is unbelievable. We’ve followed you through your journey from day one. This is just so remarkable,” one person commented on the YouTube video. Another said: “Started watching in elementary school, now 21 years old, almost four years out of high school. What a wonderful journey this has been.” One person said: “It’s crazy how far we have all come as one giant family. Congrats you two.” While PewDiePie has millions of fans, the YouTube star has been involved in his fair share of controversies over the years. In 2017 he received major backlash after using a racial slur during a live stream while playing a video game. Disney also cut ties with him earlier that year after some of his videos were found to contain anti-Semitic images and Nazi references. Most recently, the YouTuber had to issue an apology after appearing to make fun of a deaf woman’s video on TikTok. In a clip uploaded to his social media accounts, PewDiePie and his dog Maya watched what he calls “cringey TikToks”. These TikTok videos are of topics or events that most would find a little painful to sit through. However, a certain TikTok depicting a deaf woman sent people into an uproar. In the TikTok video the deaf woman is describing a common scenario at drive-throughs but doing so while also speaking via sign language. PewDiePie started mocking her voice and long nails, even mimicking the gestures with his dog, Maya. The woman in the video responded via TikTok, stating that it was, “Very weird, very unnecessary … but at the same time, I’m not surprised. I’m used to it. I’ve been trying to normalize and put it out that using nails why [sic] signing is normal. Then a big creator comes on here and puts us a million steps back so it’s very frustrating.” According to a comment posted in the video, PewDiePie removed the clip, stating he “had no clue she was deaf, but kinda dumb of me to not realize”. He went on, stating that he “only poked fun of [sic] her long nails. The voice I did for my dog is the same voice I’ve given her for years … anyway honest mistake, my bad.”0
