The violence plaguing city schools is here to stay, according to the grief-stricken mom of a Bronx student killed on April 8 — and every new tragedy makes her trauma even worse. “It’s really sad to say, but it’s not going to change,” said Yanely Henriquez, whose daughter, Angellyh Yambo, was slain while walking home from University Prep Charter High School. Three more city school kids have been murdered at dismissal time since Angellyh was killed, allegedly at the hands of a 17-year-old shooter wielding a ghost gun in a gang beef. “Shootings are getting worse. The kids are dying in vain for no reason and they’re not even a target of the situation,” Henriquez, 42, told The Post this week. “People tend to say that time heals all wounds, but to me it’s actually been worse because as time progresses, I feel her absence more,” Henriquez said. The surging violence has left Henriquez struggling, she said, with every report of a shooting or stabbing at a school leaving her traumatized all over again. “My nephew goes to school [in the Bronx] and his mother got a letter that a kid threatened the school. That brought me back,” she said. recalling how she typically dropped off and picked her daughter up from school but couldn’t the day Angellyh was killed. The mom — who has since started a foundation in Angellyh’s name to provide self-defense, financial literacy, and anti-bullying classes to kids — said the city will rename the Bronx street where her daughter grew up. The street will be renamed Angellyh Yambo Way in a ceremony on the one-year anniversary of her death. After, Henriquez will visit her daughter’s grave. “Looking at all the things my daughter has caused in a great way, it’s overwhelming,” she said. “In a way I feel sad,” the mom said, noting “all of this is happening because she had to die, and I wish to have nothing except [to] have her here.”
