World-renowned designer Thierry Despont has worked on a number of high-profile projects during his career, such as the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, the $450 million renovation of the Ritz Paris and the interiors of the exclusive 220 Central Park South condominium in New York City. But apart from his professional life, a buyer can now live like him. Despont has dropped the asking price of his high-gloss Tribeca home. Once asking $24.99 million, it’s now on the market for $19.49 million. The charming five-story townhouse, at 182 Franklin St., was built in 1915 and comes with air rights for a sixth floor. Despont, who bought the townhouse 25 years ago, transformed it into an eclectic and colorful mecca reflecting his personal style. He is also offering his design services to the buyer for an additional, and undisclosed, price. At 10,000 square feet, the home opens to a foyer that leads to a staircase and an elevator. The rear of the first floor is currently configured as an artist’s studio, but could also be a children’s playroom, a media room — or even a swimming pool, the listing notes. A main bedroom suite takes up the entire third floor and includes a marble bath, a dressing room, a sauna and lots of closet space. A fourth-floor formal dining room could also be transformed into a billiards room adjacent to the kitchen. There’s also a great room on the fifth floor with 15-foot ceilings. Design details also include two wine cellars, three gas fireplaces and a basement with a laundry room. The neighborhood includes residents like Taylor Swift, who spent close to $50 million assembling properties at 155 Franklin and 153 Franklin, as Gimme Shelter previously reported. The dashing French designer has also listed his $23.5 million Hamptons home. No comment as to why he is selling either of them — or where he plans to go. Douglas Elliman’s Rueben Schatz, Alexander Boriskin, Cameron Begg and Michael Lorber have the listing.
