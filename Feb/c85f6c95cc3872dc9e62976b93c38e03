Talk about bringing your work home with you. Actress Salma Hayek has revealed that while filming the latest “Magic Mike” film, she enjoyed  a close relationship with her scantily clad male stripper co-stars — even inviting them back to her place after hours. “By the end of the movie they all came to the house. They were all hanging out with me,” she told People. Hayek, 56, stars in the third and final installment of Channing Tatum’s male stripper franchise, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance.” She plays a wealthy divorcee who teams up with Mike (Tatum) to create a stage show — with strippers, natch — in a London theater. During filming, things got pretty cozy among the cast, she revealed — not that there was anything wrong with that. “My husband is not a jealous man,” she said. “I used to call him all the time [from set] and say, ‘Oh, my God, I feel so bad,’ because I had this predisposition about how the guys, the strippers were going to be. But they’re not. They’re lovely. They’re such great guys. And [my husband] goes, ‘Oh God, you’re becoming best friends with the strippers, aren’t you?’ And I said, ‘Yes!’” Hayek is married to French businessman Francois-Henri Pinault, 60, CEO of Kering, which owns several luxury fashion houses, such as Alexander McQueen and Gucci. They’ve been married since 2009 and have a teenage daughter together. In a candid new interview on the cover of Glamour, the Mexico-born actress compared the wedding to an “intervention,” due to her fear of commitment. Hayek said that when her husband would visit her on set, the strippers would even ask him for business advice. That helped win her husband over to her unusual new pals. “Then François was saying, ‘You’re right, they’re adorable, they’re lovely,”” she said. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” hits theaters Feb. 10.
