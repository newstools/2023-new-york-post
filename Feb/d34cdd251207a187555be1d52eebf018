Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Sunday: John Curtiss, in his first outing since undergoing Tommy John surgery, pitched a scoreless eighth inning with two strikeouts for the Mets in their 6-3 exhibition victory over the Nationals at Clover Park. Elieser Hernandez had a rocky debut for his new team, allowing one earned run on three hits and two walks over two innings. The right-hander, who arrived in a trade with the Marlins, is under consideration for the multi-inning relief role Trevor Williams held last season. In addition to hitting a monstrous home run, Ronny Mauricio was smooth turning a double play at shortstop on a grounder in the ninth inning. David Peterson is the Mets’ scheduled starting pitcher against the Cardinals in Jupiter, Fla.
