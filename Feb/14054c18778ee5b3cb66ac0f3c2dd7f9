Conservative commentator Sydney Watson has caused a stir after arguing the use of inclusive language for typically gendered labels was “dehumanizing.” A group of researchers from the US and Canada suggested alternatives to terms like “male” and “female” and “mother” and “father” should be used in science because they assumed sex was binary and heterosexuality the norm. The Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Language Project said “male” and “female” should be replaced by “sperm-producing” and “egg-producing” respectively. Sydney Watson, an Australian-American political commentator, responded to the news in a tweet on Thursday, arguing against gender being a spectrum. “New dehumanizing term for women just dropped,” she wrote alongside an image of an article with the headline: “Use ‘egg-producing’ not ‘female’, say scientists in call to phase out binary language.” In another tweet, she suggested men would be referred to as “non-egg producing.” “The hilarious thing about this is that in order to discuss men, they’d have to say ‘non-egg-producing’. It’s almost like sex is … binary,” she wrote.
