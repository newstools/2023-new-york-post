SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher gave a speech at the 2023 SAG Awards Sunday night urging Hollywood to use its power to end its “bulls – – t” COVID-19 vaccine mandate. “As the nation declares an end to the COVID emergency this May, I hope we will see everyone return to work in equal opportunity,” Drescher, 65, said in her speech during the telecast. The industry’s pandemic protocols were originally set to end Jan. 31, but will now expire April 1. Meanwhile, more than 20 states still enforce vaccine mandates to varying degrees. Those who oppose the mandates believe that they discriminates against people who refuse to be vaccinated for religious or medical reasons. “The Nanny” star used her moment in the awards season spotlight to put pressure on Hollywood to use its blockbuster bankroll to influence state politics and make change. “Our industry brings billions of production dollars to states across the nation, but if they want our business, let’s wield our financial influence to make governors act in the best interest of freedom, diversity, inclusion and democracy,” Drescher said. “As my character Bobbi Flekman said in ‘This Is Spinal Tap’ — money talks and bulls – – t walks!” In her speech, the actress also discussed her efforts to help make Hollywood more environmentally friendly by joining with Green Council with a goal to eliminate single-use plastic on camera and behind the scenes. She applauded IMDb.com for “taking a stand AGAINST ageism, stereotyping and gender rigidity by allowing our members to define themselves their way on their profile page — for FREE.” Drescher, who has been open about how she stays healthy as she gets older, also congratulated her fellow Hollywood seniors that are on Medicare for being eligible for a free supplemental benefit. Drescher was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2000, and has remained cancer-free ever since undergoing a hysterectomy.
