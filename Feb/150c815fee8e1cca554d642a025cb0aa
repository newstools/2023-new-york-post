A shirtless, belligerent man randomly whacked another man over the head with what appears to be an empty liquor bottle in an early morning attack in Manhattan Sunday. The unidentified suspect hit the 42-year-old victim multiple times over the head with the glass bottle near Lafayette Street and Prince Street in SoHo at about 3:15 a.m. Sunday, police said. Police released video of the suspect, which shows him walking through the street holding the bottle and sporting a hairy chest, brown beard and a mop of unkempt hair. The victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition after the attack. The suspect ran off, heading west on Prince Street, authorities said. No arrests have been made, police said.
