She’s hot property indeed. A sexy Texas realtor has gone viral on TikTok, amassing more than 40,000 fans on the social media app — many of whom have no interest in what she’s selling. The Houston-based beauty, known only as Kimberlee online, frequently shares videos that show her strutting through the luxe listings she has up for rent. And while some of the dwellings are certainly jaw-dropping, it’s Kimberlee herself that many find to be the most enticing attraction. In one clip posted on Monday, the property maven can be seen showing off a lavish apartment in Memorial City as Snoop Dogg’s “Sensual Seduction” plays in the background. Confident Kimberlee saunters through the spacious structure, which boasts a modern fireplace and floor-to-ceiling windows — but many weren’t interested in any of the building’s first-class fixtures. “What is she selling again?” one man asked, implying that he’d been completely distracted by the brunette bombshell. “So how much is the car again?” another amorous admirer quipped, claiming he hadn’t been paying any attention to the property. Other titillated TikTokkers described Kimberlee as a “goddess” and a “beautiful lady.” One man even claimed there’d be no way his wife would allow him to look at Kimberlee’s listings, given her incredible looks. “My wife would never allow me to view,” he complained beneath the clip. Meanwhile, another amorous admirer outrightly asked: “Do you come with any of the homes? You’re gorgeous.” However, it wasn’t just Monday’s video that incited a stir. Kimberlee’s clips are frequently inundated with loads of lusty comments. Ever the professional, the property expert keeps things strictly business on her TikTok page, and has not engaged with or encouraged her frisky fans. Kimberlee also hasn’t disclosed whether she herself is off the market — refusing to answer her fan’s queries concerning her love life.
