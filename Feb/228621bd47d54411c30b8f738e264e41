PORT ST. LUCIE — The Mets held an intrasquad scrimmage a day before their Grapefruit League home opener Saturday as a dress rehearsal for players and stadium operations personnel alike. Evidently, they didn’t work out all the kinks. About halfway through the Mets’ 5-2 victory over the Marlins on Saturday, sprinklers began showering the outfield at Clover Park, briefly delaying the game. Amused fans held up their phones to capture the moment on video. Earlier in the day, Brett Baty hit a two-run home run to center field off of Astros right-hander Brandon Bielak during the first inning of the team’s first official game of the spring in West Palm Beach, Fla. on Saturday. He also walked later in the game.
