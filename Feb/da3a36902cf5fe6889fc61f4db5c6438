A student threatened another boy with a gun at a public high school in the West Village on Monday, while someone shot out the windows of two classrooms at a Staten Island elementary school, cops said. One of the targeted classrooms at PS 78 in Staten Island’s Clifton section had 10 adult students inside at the time, police said. No one was injured. The other classroom was unoccupied. In the troubling incident in Manhattan, an 18-year-old pulled a black revolver on a 17-year-old fellow student inside High School M560-City As School on Clarkson Street before running off around noon, cops said. No one was injured, and it was unclear whether the gun was loaded. Cops have identified the 18-year-old and are trying to locate him. Police sources said the teen often doesn’t attend school. About a half-hour later, at 12:30 p.m., someone shot out the first-floor windows in the two classrooms at the Staten Island school on Hill Street. That suspect fled in a car. Both incidents involve just the latest violence in and around city schools. A 37-year-old security guard was wounded along with two teens in a shooting last week outside Williamsburg Charter High School in Brooklyn. The private guard, who was hired by the school, was grazed in the neck by a bullet as he tried to break up a melee during afternoon dismissal Wednesday. Video footage taken at the scene shoed kids wildly throwing punches in the street before at least four shots were fired.
