Here are some nuggets from Yankees’ spring training on Sunday: In his first at-bat of the spring, Jose Trevino came up with the bases loaded and crushed a no-doubt grand slam off right-hander Bryce Elder. The Yankees took a run at throwing a combined no-hitter against the Braves, but had to settle for a one-hitter after Sam Hilliard singled off Will Warren in the seventh inning. Atlanta’s lineup only included one expected starter, but five Yankees pitchers combined for 11 strikeouts and three walks. Bernie Williams arrived in camp on Sunday as a guest instructor and spent time talking with Harrison Bader and Jasson Dominguez, among others, during batting practice on a backfield. Luis Severino is scheduled to start the Yankees’ 6:35 p.m. game against the Tigers at Steinbrenner Field.
