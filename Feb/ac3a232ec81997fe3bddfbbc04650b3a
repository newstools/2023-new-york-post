Two cyclists were killed and 11 more seriously injured when a pickup truck plowed into the group in Arizona over the weekend. Pedro Quintana-Lujan, 26, was arrested at the scene and charged with manslaughter after the fatal collision on the Cotton Lane Bridge in Goodyear shortly before 8 a.m. Saturday, NBC News said. Police said the victims were part of a large group of cycling enthusiasts riding along the bridge when they were struck. One woman was pronounced dead at the scene, and another biker died after being rushed to a local hospital, police said. Cops said one of the fatalities was a local resident and the other was a visitor from out of town. Those hurt were hospitalized with “very serious injuries,” cops told KTVK-TV. Quintana-Lujan remained at the scene after allegedly striking the cyclists, the outlets said. He also was charged with aggravated assault and causing serious injury or death by a moving violation. It isn’t clear why the driver plowed into the riders. “These are individuals that are finding a way to be healthy and to be out there with friends, and now there are people that aren’t coming home,” John Hogen, vice president of the Rob Dollar Foundation, said of the cyclists to KTVK. His group was named for a bike rider killed in Phoenix in 2017. “Anytime this happens it’s a flashback,” Hogen said. “Our heart is going to those families because we know the pain they’re feeling.”
