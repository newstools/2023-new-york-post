The union representing rank-and-file Border Patrol agents took a swipe at the Biden administration Friday as a Chinese spy balloon made its way serenely over American soil. “China watching our border more closely than the Biden Admin,” the National Border Patrol Council tweeted. The union fired off the snarky tweet after the Pentagon revealed that the balloon had been floating over the US for several days. At one point, the balloon appeared over Montana, which is home to one of the US’ three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The Border Patrol union’s criticism of national security comes as President Biden, 80, continues to grapple with the ongoing migration crisis, which has seen record numbers of illegal border-crossers surging into the US. More than a quarter-million migrant encounters were tallied at the US-Mexico border in December — the highest monthly total ever recorded, according to the latest data from US Customs and Border Protection. The 251,487 illegal-entry encounters at the southern border in December surpassed the 179,253 in December 2021 and the 73,994 in December 2020. The month’s influx came after the record-breaking fiscal year 2022, in which more than 2.4 million migrants were stopped at the border. Biden has been widely slammed over his failure to stem the record influx, and the House Judiciary Committee kicked off a series of hearings earlier this week dedicated to the deteriorating humanitarian situation. House Republicans have also called for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to be impeached and removed due to his handling of the crisis.
