A new poll shows that most Americans characterize ​the US as a dysfunctional family on the verge of splitting apart — a sentiment widely held among members of rival political parties. The Fox News poll​ asked voters about efforts to unify the country before President Biden’s State of the Union address next Tuesday and found that 81% of Americans describe the US as a dysfunctional family, an increase of 10 percentage points from 2020. Only 16% say America is a tight-knit family. Eighty-six percent of Republicans and independents see the US as a dysfunctional family, as do 74% of Democrats. The survey released Wednesday also shows that ​most Americans — 80% — rate the economy as either “only fair” or “poor,” and 73% are “not very” or “not at all” satisfied with the way things are going in the country​. More than half of Democrats — 55% — and 86% of Republicans say they are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Asked about their financial affairs, 47% ​of Americans ​say they are “holding steady” while 44% say they are “falling behind” — and only 8% say they are “getting ahead.” And 74% of Americans believe the US will have a recession this year, compared to 20% who disagree. But 86% say they are concerned about inflation, 80% fret over high crime rates, 78% worry about political divisions, and 76% ​agonize over opioid addictions. Following are concerns over the debate on the nation’s debt ceiling (68%), the war in Ukraine (68%), gun laws (66%), border security (65%) and illegal immigration (63%). As Biden is poised to address the nation next week, his ​45% approval rating remains mired in the 40s as it has over most of his first term, down from its high of 56% in June 2021. Americans give him poor marks for his handling of inflation (66%), the economy (61%) and border security (61%). But Biden’s approval rating is higher than that of Vice President Kamala Harris (39%), ​the Supreme Court (41%), Democrats in Congress (42%) and Republicans in Congress (38%). Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence are caught up in controversies over their handling of classified documents. But just over half of Americans — 51% — think Trump did something illegal, compared to 37% for Biden and 22% for Pence. Fifty-four percent say Pence was careless with the materials, as do 46% about Biden and 29% about Trump. But 70% say Congress should investigate Biden over the classified documents, as do 57% for Trump and 56% for Pence. Another 61% think Congress should investigate first son Hunter Biden’s business dealings. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters between Jan. 27 and 30. It has a plus/minus 3 percentage-point margin of error.
