In the aftermath of a blockbuster trade that resulted in the Rangers landing All-Star Vladimir Tarasenko from the Blues, another star NHL player is a bit disappointed. Patrick Kane, the Blackhawks’ nine-time All-Star right winger, viewed the Rangers as a potential  landing spot amid uncertainty with Chicago. “It’s not like the happiest I’ve been to hear about a trade,” admitted Kane after practice Friday afternoon. “I think the Rangers are a team that you definitely pay attention to and definitely are intrigued by, for obvious reasons.” “If things were going to happen, that was a team I was definitely looking at,” Kane continued. “It seems like they kind of filled their void and went ahead and made a deal, so it is what it is.” The Rangers had interest in trading for Kane, but rumors of his lingering hip injury dwindled those plans away and they ended up with Tarasenko . Kane commented that his injury is being “overblown” and that he “feels better that last year.” Kane has not yet explicitly told the Blackhawks organization that he would like to be traded, but expects to make a decision in the next 10 days, according to NBC Chicago. “Obviously you want to do right by the franchise, and the organization here has been amazing to me and given me so much,” Kane said. “So you definitely want what’s best for both sides.” This season, Kane has recorded nine goals and 26 assists on a struggling Blackhawks squad that currently sits in last place of the Western Conference at 15-29-5.
