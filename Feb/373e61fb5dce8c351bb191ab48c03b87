Friends of Hayden Panettiere’s younger brother, Jansen, worried about him when he didn’t show up to a business meeting shortly before being found dead Sunday, TMZ reports. The 28-year-old brother of the “Scream” actress, 33, died at his home in New York. Hayden’s rep, Kasey Kitchen, confirmed the death to CNN. Jansen’s cause of death has not been announced. The Post reached out to the Orangetown Police Department and reps for the Panettiere family for comment. In the police report obtained by TMZ, one of Jansen’s friends reportedly rushed over to his apartment after he failed to show for the meeting. The friend found him unresponsive, “sitting upright in a chair,” according to TMZ, called 911 and performed CPR. Jansen and Hayden worked together on the Disney Channel original movie “Tiger Cruise” in 2004 and the family comedy “Racing Stripes” in 2005. Jansen lent his voice to several 2000s hits, like “Blue’s Clues,” “Robots” and “Ice Age: The Meltdown.” In 2019, he also appeared on one episode of “The Walking Dead.” He voiced Truman X in Nickelodeon’s “The X’s,” an animated television series that aired from 2005 to 2006. On his Instagram page, Jansen often posted photos of his colorful artwork, which included abstract drawings and paintings. Hayden has not publicly commented on the death of her brother. In 2008, Jansen was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his role as Luke in “The Last Day of Summer.”
