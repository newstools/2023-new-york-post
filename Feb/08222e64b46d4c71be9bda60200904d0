The best friend of one of the murdered University of Idaho students found his pal stabbed to death in bed then called 911, rather than one of the surviving two roommate in the house according to a report. Citing unnamed sources, NewsNation reported Wednesday that Ethan Chapin was found dead in bed with his girlfriend Xana Kernodle by a longtime buddy, who went as far to check his pulse before calling 911. Chapin and Kernodle, both 20, were killed on Nov. 13 along with Madison Mogen, 21, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, at their off-campus home is Moscow, Idaho. It had been previously reported the phone of Dylan Mortensen, 21 — who survived the attack alongside Bethany Funke — was used to call the police almost eight hours after the slayings happened in the early hours of the morning. NewsNation withheld the name of Chapin’s best friend, but said they were the one who used Mortensen’s phone to make the call. Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D student at nearby Washington State University Pullman, was arrested in December and chargd with the quadruple murder, but is expected to plead not guilty when he is arraigned later this year. Mortensen allegedly called out to her friends to quiet down as the murders were taking place, believing they were partying, NewsNation previously reported. The surviving roommate has also told authorities she saw a “figure clad in black clothing and a mask” walking past her toward the home’s back exit just after 4 a.m. on the night of the murders. Mortensen and Funke’s delay in notifying authorities puzzled investigators, an Idaho law enforcement source told The Post, saying police weren’t sure if it was “an issue of intoxication, or of fear”. Neither were ever considered to be suspects in the case.
