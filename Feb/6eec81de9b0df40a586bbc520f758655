The Detroit Red Wings and Ottawa Senators have plenty in common. Both teams made splashy moves in the offseason to accelerate their progress, but neither was expected to contend for a playoff spot in the NHL Atlantic Division. But with just a few days before the trade deadline, both Detroit and Ottawa can count themselves in the mix for a wild-card spot. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: DET +1.5 (-225) vs. SEN: -1.5 (+185) Moneyline: DET (+115) vs. SEN (-135) Total: Over 6.5 (-105) | Under 6.5 (-115) (7 p.m. ET., ESPN+) Entering play on Sunday, the Senators were five points behind Pittsburgh and seven points adrift of the Islanders, but the Sens had four games in hand on the Isles. Detroit, too, had played four fewer games than the Islanders and were just three points behind the Isles. Another similarity between the two sides is that both the Senators and Red Wings have focused on improving their defensive structure in order to grind out results. Both the Wings and Senators have deep forward groups that can put up crooked numbers, but it’s been their work at the other end of the ice that’s been buoying them over the last two weeks. Ottawa and Detroit rank 10th and 12th, respectively, in high-danger scoring chances allowed in their last 10 games. That defensive improvement has come at a cost upfront, though, as the Wings have created the fewest high-danger opportunities at five-on-five in that span, and the Sens are just a shade better. These teams are looking to grind out low-event games of late, leading us to a bet on the Under on Monday night. THE PICK: Under 6.5 goals -115 (BetMGM)
