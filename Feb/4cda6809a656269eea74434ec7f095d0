Get ready for a lot more laughs. “Saturday Night Live” alums Tina Fey and Amy Poehler announced Monday that they will be launching their own comedy tour to celebrate 30 years of friendship. “If this tour goes right, we can finally end this friendship,” joked the duo in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. Their Restless Leg Tour is scheduled to kick off on April 28 at the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, DC, followed by show dates in Chicago, Boston and Atlantic City, NJ. Tickets for the shows are set to go on presale on Feb. 15 with the general public being able to purchase tickets on Feb. 17. Poehler, 51, and Fey, 52, were the first all-female anchors on the “Weekend Update” segment of “SNL.” They eventually moved on to star in their own shows, “Parks and Recreation” for Poehler and “30 Rock” for Fey, but reunited for the 2004 film “Mean Girls.” The comedic duo has also hosted the Golden Globes four times together. In January, Poehler made a cameo appearance on “SNL” alongside her “Parks and Rec” co-star Aubrey Plaza, who hosted the show. As her character Leslie Knope, Poehler joked to “Weekend Update” host Colin Jost about his segment being “easy.” “I want to pick your brain about this job, about this show,” she said, “because I used to watch this when Seth Meyers did it by himself with no one else and he made it look really easy.” Meanwhile, Fey is currently producing and writing the script for a “Mean Girls” movie musical for Paramount+.
