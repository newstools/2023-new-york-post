Tensions reportedly escalated between Migos members Quavo and Offset at Sunday night’s 65th Grammy Awards, reportedly resulting in a fight backstage before a tribute for Takeoff. Quavo was about to perform his song “Without You,” in honor of the rapper who was shot and killed in November 2022, when the altercation apparently started, according to TMZ. Sources said the physical fight began during the In Memoriam portion of the show, with Quavo — who is also Takeoff’s uncle — allegedly instigating the fight. Insiders told the outlet that Offset had been asked to take part in the tribute for their slain fellow Migos member, but Quavo reportedly had blocked Offset from joining him onstage. The pair reportedly had to be separated, and Quavo ended up performing his song solo. The Post has reached out to representatives for Quavo and Offset for comment. Takeoff — whose real name was Kirsnick Khari Ball — was killed in a shooting after a fight broke out over a dice game at a private party in downtown Houston. He was 28. The Grammy nominee’s record label said his death was the result of “senseless violence and a stray bullet.” Patrick Xavier Clark — Takeoff’s suspected killer — was released from jail in January after posting the $1 million bail. Takeoff formed the band along with his uncle, Quavo, and cousin, Offset, 30, in 2008. The 2023 awards show took place at the Crypto.com Arena, formerly known as the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and was hosted by Trevor Noah for the third year in a row.
