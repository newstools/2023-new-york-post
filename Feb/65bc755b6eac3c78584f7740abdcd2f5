Four Arkansas lawmakers — three male and one female — filed a bill Tuesday to create a monument to fetuses aborted during the nearly 50 years of Roe v. Wade. The “Monument for the Unborn” would be erected on State Capitol Grounds in Little Rock and would be dedicated to the “at least” 236,243 elective abortions politicians estimate were performed between 1973 and 2022. The bill refers to the 49-year span as the years “Arkansas was prevented from protecting the life of unborn children.” “As a memorial to the lives lost from 1973 to 2022 due to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and as a constant reminder of our duty to protect the life of every innocent human person, no matter how young or old, or how helpless and vulnerable that person may be, it is the intent of the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas to enact the Monument to Unborn Children Display Act … and the Monument to Unborn Children Display Fund,” the unnamed bill states. A trust fund would also be created to erect the memorial if the bill passes. Only gifts, grants and donations would be used to finance the project. The bill is spearheaded by four state politicians — three of whom are male. Kim Hammer is the lead signer for the state Senate, and is joined by male co-signers Tyler Dees and John Payton. State Rep. Mary Bentley is the only female sponsor of the bill. Neither Hammer nor Bentley immediately responded to The Post’s request for comment. Arkansas instituted a near-total abortion ban — one of the strictest in the country — that makes the procedure illegal at any stage in the pregnancy. The state only allows the procedure to save the life of the mother. It does not provide exceptions for those impregnated in an act of rape or incest.
