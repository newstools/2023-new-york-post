A waterfront estate in Rye, NY, has sold for a hefty $12.25 million. The Georgian colonial home, which comes with a big dose of history, first hit the market for $14.99 million in May 2022. The estate was built in 1917 by the architectural firm Trowbridge & Livingston, founded in 1894 by Samuel Beck Parkman Trowbridge and Goodhue Livingston. The partners also designed the iconic St. Regis Hotel, and Wall Street’s J.P. Morgan building — along with the original Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, the B. Altman and Company Building and Oregon’s State Capitol. The original owner of the property, which sits on 2.82 acres at 859 Forest Ave., was one of the Dodge Motor Company owners who built it as a wedding gift for his daughter. In the 1960s, architect Yasuo Matsui, who worked on the Empire State Building, led the renovation work. By then, the home was dubbed Bayberry Cove. During the 1960s, it was home to Ambassador Carlos María Velázquez, who headed the Uruguayan mission to the United Nations. The property also served as the South American country’s embassy. With 470 feet on the water, the eight-bedroom, 8,800-square-foot home comes with its own sandy beach, a deep-water dock, a pool and a hot tub. There are also rolling green lawns, a heated cobblestone front driveway, a four-car garage with an attached breezeway, a greenhouse and a widow’s walk with panoramic Long Island Sound views. Inside, the home features French doors, multiple terraces, five fireplaces, hardwood floors, high ceilings and grand entertaining spaces. There’s also a home office, a formal dining room, a chef’s kitchen, a breakfast room and a lower-level spa. The sellers bought the property in 1999 for $5.95 million — some $10.8 million today. The listing brokers were Elizabeth Higgins and Michael McCooey of Compass.
