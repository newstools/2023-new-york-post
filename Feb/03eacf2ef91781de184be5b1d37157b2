After months of searching, celebrity couple Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have chosen a new marital home. The power duo is reportedly now in contract to buy a multimillion-dollar mansion in a star-studded corner of Los Angeles: a sprawling Pacific Palisades estate last listed for $34.5 million, according to TMZ. The A-list singer, 53, and the two-time Academy Award-winner, 50, were photographed this weekend checking out the 15,100-square-foot compound with their kids — Affleck’s daughter Seraphina and Lopez’s twins, Emme and Maximilian, all 14. The property — which was held by Compass and is now listed as being under contract — is set on a full, Sycamore tree-surrounded acre of land. It has seven bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a six-car garage and a detached guest house. What’s more, there’s also a pool, a Jacuzzi, an outdoor kitchen and a home theater. Described as having a “Hamptons-esque” design, the dwelling also has a motor court, an arched brick porte-cochere, six fireplaces, a “servants quarters,” a wine cellar and a gym. Before settling on this palatial abode, the couple — who tied the knot for a second time in July 2022 — considered a number of other area properties, many with significantly higher price points. Not long after flaking on a $55 million Bel-Air property last year, the pair were spotted checking out the former manor of the late TV mogul Aaron Spelling, which was then priced at $165 million. As the lovebirds prepare to close on their new abode, Lopez, long known as a savvy property investor, is working on offloading a former one. Earlier this month, the Bronx native listed her French-style, nine-bedroom Bel-Air property of six years for $42.5 million. The entertainer purchased the property in 2016, for $28 million — meaning she stands to make quite the penny off it should it get its asking price.
