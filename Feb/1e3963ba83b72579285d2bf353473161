Los Angeles Rams running back Ronnie Rivers nearly doubled his 2022 salary during a trip to Las Vegas this weekend. The 24-year-old won $514,837 when he hit the Mega Progressive Jackpot while playing three-card poker at Caesars Palace. The rookie barely made more than his winnings during his first season in the NFL, bringing in about $515,670, according to Spotrac. He is set to make $870,000 in 2023. Rivers was in town celebrating his mother’s birthday and plans to buy a home with his winnings, according to KTNV, Las Vegas’ ABC affiliate. Rivers signed with the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in 2022. He would later spend some time with the Seattle Seahawks before joining the Rams’ practice squad. He appeared in eight games and made one start this season for the Rams during Week 8 against the San Francisco 49ers, rushing for 21 yards on nine carries and 29 receiving yards on five catches. The Fresno State alum was promoted to the active roster in November.
