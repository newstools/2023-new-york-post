What’s the number one problem with TV’s these days? In our opinion, it’s that they don’t look enough like a painting. Sure, you can project family pictures on it or even add a screensaver of a world-famous painting, but no matter what, when you turn the TV off after a long day of binging, it’s not going to be wall art. It’s still unmistakably a flat-screen TV, taking up one side of your living room. But what about your friends who told you you don’t have a TV? (Because it’s so chic to say that these days.) When they come over, the jig is up. They’re going to know you have a TV and absolutely adore watching every silly, fun streaming event on it, like the Super Bowl or J-Lo’s “Shotgun Wedding.” Luckily, there’s a solution; one so masterful it’s sure to pass unnoticed by even your most dubious friends. Even luckier: this solution is $1,000 off on Amazon right now. The Frame is a 75″ QLED 4K TV from Samsung, that doubles as a 75″ frame for family photos or timeless masterpieces with just one press of the Art Button.
