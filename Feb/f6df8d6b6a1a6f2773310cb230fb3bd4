Connecticut upper-cruster Hadley Palmer, who was jailed for secretly recording nude minors in her ritzy mansion, was exclusively spotted by The Post on Friday — just days after walking free from prison early. The 54-year-old registered sex offender shied away from the camera as she got behind the wheel of her car in Greenwich on Friday morning, photos show. At one point, Palmer tried to shield her face with her hands and bury her head behind the steering wheel before driving off. It is the first time the blond mom of four has been pictured since she was granted early release on Wednesday. Palmer, who was slapped with a one-year prison sentence last November, served just 161 days — less than half her full sentence — in a state penitentiary, the Daily Beast was first to report. She has since entered a transitional supervision program, which allows inmates with sentences of less than two years to serve some of their time in a halfway house or with a sponsor. The disgraced socialite admitted to secretly filming three minors who were naked or in their underwear between 2017 and 2018 for her own sexual satisfaction. One of her victims was under the age of 15. She pleaded guilty to three counts of voyeurism and risk of injury to a minor back in January 2022 — but the majority of her case details were mysteriously kept from public view. The Stamford judge who sealed the case argued it was necessary to protect the victims’ identities. Critics, however, argued it was a highly unusual move because case files are usually released with the victims’ names or other personal information redacted. As part of her sentence, Palmer — the daughter of hedge fund founder Jerrold Fine — has to register as a sex offender for 10 years and spend 20 years on probation. She is in the middle of a contentious divorce from her venture capitalist husband, Bradley Palmer. The couple had been married for more than 30 years and share four children.
