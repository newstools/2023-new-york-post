ChatGPT has made some major waves on the internet lately as the smartest AI ever released to the public. It may be smart, but if you’ve tried using it, you may have noticed it takes some guidance and revision before you can get the really good answers from the AI. If this really is the technology that’s going to change the internet forever, then you may want to figure out how to get the most out of it while it’s still free to use. The Complete ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence OpenAI Training Bundle could help you master this AI and see how you can use it in your own work, and it’s only $29.99. Google is releasing their own comparable AI chatbot and Bing has already begun integrating ChatGPT into their browser tools. The technology is developing fast. If you haven’t practiced with it, then check out ChatGPT for Beginners, one of four awesome courses in this AI education bundle. The beginner course covers the basics like how to write effective prompts and how you can even learn from ChatGPT. You’ll practice using AI to write in different media like character biographies, poetry, song lyrics, even plot points and ideas for fictional works. Once you’re ready to go beyond the basics, you can start learning about creating blog posts by having artificial intelligence write them for you. Sales Copy might take a fraction of the time to produce when you can just press a button after filling in the right prompt. See how you can combine your expertise with Python and Django to create your own AI bot in two courses taught by pioneer web developer John Elder. You could even try these two courses if you’re a novice programmer because one of the first things you learn is how to ask the AI to write code for you. ChatGPT may just be the first in a new wave of advanced AI that you can integrate into your work, hobbies, and daily life. Learn to use it when you get the Complete ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence OpenAI Training bundle for $30. Prices subject to change.
