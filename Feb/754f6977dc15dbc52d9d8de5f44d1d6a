The Drake Curse is something to be feared, and if you are a Kansas City Chiefs fan, it’s ok to be frightened right now. Drake revealed he’s betting a tidy $700,000 on the Chiefs this Sunday when they take on the Eagles in Super Bowl 2023. “My psychotic bets for Sunday are in @Stake”, said Drake in his Instagram caption. “Pls do not analyze the logic behind these bets there is none.” The OVO honcho and award-winning Canadian rapper has been infamous for jinxing teams and athletes on multiple occasions. He backed NFL flameout Johnny Manziel and ex-UFC champ Conor McGregor when they were at their height, both falling from grace shortly after his public approval. He was also notoriously rooting for Serena Williams in the finals of the 2015 U.S. Open and the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals. Both lost. Drake announced his partnership with the cryptocurrency betting platform Stake last year, which continued his tear of throwing ridiculous amounts of money on sporting events. He has won — and lost — quite a bit of money while betting, though it all seems to be good fun for the billionair. The $700k was not the only bet he placed for Sunday’s big game. He threw $50,000 each on both Patrick Mahomes and JuJu Smith-Schuster to be the first Chiefs touchdown scorer, another $50,000 on the Chiefs to win both halves, $30,000 on Chiefs to win each quarter, $25,000 for Travis Kelce to be Super Bowl MVP, and finally $60,000 for the position of the Super Bowl MVP to be a tight end. That’s nearly a million dollars being placed on the game. Last year, Drake also put huge sum of money on the Super Bowl. Unlike this year, he rode the favorite Rams and it paid off, big time. This year, he’s going with the underdogs. Take at your own risk.
