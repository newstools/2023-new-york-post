Will the real Paige Spiranac please stand up? On Friday, the “Playing A Round” podcast host revealed on Twitter that two social media accounts impersonating her were engaging in a back-and-forth with each other. “I can’t make this up. Fake me is calling out other fake me,” Spiranac wrote alongside a screenshot of the exchange. In this tale of two Paiges, the “pqige_renee” account fired a message to the “paigerenee_privatechat” page, writing: “Hey who do you think you are?” Dealing with imposter accounts is nothing new for the 29-year-old golf influencer. Back in November, Spiranac — who boasts more than three million followers on Instagram — broke down what fans need to look out for in case a “fake Paige” reaches out to them. “Is the message coming from my verified account? If so, it is me,” Spiranac said. “Is the message coming from an account under my name that has zero followers, it is not me, that is a fake account,” she added. If an account inquires fans about money, gift cards, or a relationship, Spiranac said those are red flags to watch out for. “If this person calls you dear, honey, handsome, valued friend, valued fan, my fan, it’s not me,” Spiranac said. The golf influencer, who has previously dealt with frustrated fans who claim they were duped by her, recently launched a subscription-based site, “Only Paige,” as a new way to connect with her most loyal supporters. “My followers have been asking me forever to join a subscription site and I really love the idea of a subscription program but I wanted to do it in a way that felt comfortable to me and felt authentic,” Spiranac told Forbes in a recent interview. “OnlyPaige” subscribers will have access to golf instructional videos, photos, Q&As and live streams, among other content.
