An ugly brawl broke out after a heated soccer game between two private high schools — one Jewish and the other Catholic — in Miami this week, with some players saying they were hit with anti-Semitic slurs. Footage of the troubling incident between the Scheck Hillel Community School and Archbishop Coleman Carroll High School in Florida shows players battling soon after Wednesday night’s game ended. The video also includes spectators pouring from the stands to join the fray, where several punches were thrown and shoves were exchanged. Parents of the players from the Jewish school asserted that someone said, “Hitler was right” during the fight, and that other opponents spewed different anti-Jewish slurs. There was reportedly one injury resulting from the confrontation, but details were not made available. The two religious schools issued a joint statement after the video of the fight — and the accusations of anti-Semitism — began circulating online. “The Archdiocese of Miami and Scheck Hillel have zero tolerance for any kind of aggressive language and behavior, antisemitism or hate of any kind,” the schools said. “We are thankful for the faculty of both schools, who immediately managed the situation with care and concern for the students.” The schools said they are investigating the accusations and will take “appropriate action” against those found to have committed misconduct. Archbishop Coleman, located in The Hammocks in Dade County, opened in 1998 and enrolls roughly 330 students. Scheck Hillel was established in Ojus in 1973 and has about 1,250 students.
