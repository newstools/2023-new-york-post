Indiana showed us just how dangerous it can be on Saturday when it blasted top-ranked Purdue at home in a game that wasn’t as close as the final score suggests. What do the Hoosiers have planned as an encore? After Saturday’s 79-74 win, Indiana boasts a stellar 12-1 record at home and a 5-1 home record in Big Ten play, with its only loss coming by one point against Northwestern amid the Hoosiers’ three-game losing streak in early January. Since then, they’ve won six of seven games overall with a perfect 4-0 record at home — outscoring teams by 13 points per game at Assembly Hall. 6:30 p.m.ET., Big Ten Network Rutgers is an elite team in its own right, ranking higher than Indiana in net efficiency thanks to one of the best defenses in the country. Unfortunately for the Scarlet Knights, that defense hasn’t traveled well: Rutgers is just 2-5 in seven games away from home, posting seven of its eight worst showings by defensive efficiency in those contests. Indiana isn’t the same team that lost to the Scarlet Knights by 15 points on Dec. 3; star scorer Trayce Jackson-Davis said as much after the Purdue win. This game on Tuesday is a payback spot for a hungry Hoosiers team that looks virtually unbeatable at home right now; given Rutgers’ road woes, this is an easy play on the favored hosts. A reminder, Rutgers action is not taken at New Jersey sportsbooks, but this game is available to bet in New York, Pennsylvania, and other legal states. THE PLAY: Indiana -4.5 (FanDuel)
