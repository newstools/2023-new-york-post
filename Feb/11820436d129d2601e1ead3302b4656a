Dallas Goedert has been the model of consistency in the Philadelphia offense throughout the playoffs. Through two playoff games, he has totaled 10 receptions for 61 yards and has found the end zone once. In the Super Bowl, he will have one of the best matchups on the field. The Chiefs will be forced to utilize their linebackers to cover Goedert, as their safeties are going to be helping on Brown and Smith on the outside. That plan has not worked well for them this season and could be a grave mistake against Goedert. Kansas City linebackers have allowed a 90% catch rate to tight ends over the past six weeks. Given Goedertâ€™s matchup, target volume, and ability to run after the catch, there is value on him to score.
