A.J. Green, once among the best players in the NFL, has retired from the league after 12 seasons. Green played wide receiver for the Bengals for his first 10 years in the NFL before playing two seasons for the Cardinals. He announced his retirement in a post on Instagram. “I’ve never been a man of many words, so I’ll keep this short,” Green wrote. “Thank you. Thank you to all who have supported, encouraged, and inspired me throughout my career. Special thank you to the University of Georgia, Cincinnati Bengals, and Arizona Cardinals for the opportunity to pursue my dreams. I’ve stayed true to the game and it owes me nothing. Be blessed.. Love y’all! The next chapter begins…” Green was selected fourth overall by the Bengals in the 2011 NFL Draft. He was a seven-time Pro Bowler and twice was a second-team All-Pro. In his career he caught 727 balls for 10,514 and 70 touchdowns. Green was a dominant force in his first seven seasons in the league, all of which were punctuated by Pro Bowl selections, until he got derailed due to injuries. The wideout battled a toe injury in 2018 and missed seven games, and then missed the entire 2019 season after tearing ligaments in his ankle during training camp. While Green could never quite recapture the same production after his injuries, he remained a deep threat until the end of his career. In the Cardinals’ Week 18 game against the Niners, which wound up being Green’s final game, he caught a 77-yard bomb for a touchdown on a trick play on the team’s second play from scrimmage.
