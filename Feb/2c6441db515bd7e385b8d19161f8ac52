Snow way! Old Man Winter finally made his presence felt in the Big Apple Monday night as what’s forecast to be the first significant snowfall of the season began to coat the five boroughs. “Wow! Its actually snowing outside!” an excited Twitter user exclaimed from Washington Heights. “First real snow in NYC this season.” “Always wanted to see snow in NYC and today is finally happened,” another Twitter user celebrated. “Something about snow in New York that is magical,” another city dweller tweeted. And NY1 journalist Victoria Manna might’ve summed it up best, “Nooooowwww it’s winter.” AccuWeather senior meteorologist Matt Rinde estimated about an inch or so had fallen in the five boroughs by late Monday night. Forecasters predicted the city could see 1-3 inches of snow before rain begins mixing in. But “once heavier precipitation gets started it might go back over to snow,” said Rinde. This winter has had a notable lack of snow in the city. The only measurable snowfall before Monday night occurred earlier this month when a mere 0.4 inches was recorded in Central Park. In upper Manhattan by about 11 p.m. the snow had mostly turned to slush with a light coating over parked cars. A wintry mix was coming down with temperatures just around freezing. One Upper West Side resident was digging the weather as he walked his two dogs. “I’m honestly delighted to see some semblance of normal winter weather,” Manhattan resident Jon Brayshaw told The Post “I’ve lived in the Northeast my whole life and I’ve been in New York 33 years and this is honestly the first time I can remember an entire year going by with any kind of snowfall to speak of.” While parts of the city could see up to 3 inches of snow, the suburbs to the north and west could see anywhere from 5 to 8 inches, forecasters said.
