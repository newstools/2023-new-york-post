Here are some nuggets from Mets’ spring training on Tuesday: Carlos Carrasco faced five hitters in live batting practice on Clover Park’s main field and showed good movement on his fastball. The right-hander threw 18 pitches and only Omar Narvaez produced solid contact against him. Pete Alonso was among Carrasco’s casualties, hitting a weak fly ball to right field on a two-seam fastball. Alonso walked from the plate asking Carrasco what pitch had just jammed him. The stadium thermometer on the scoreboard has displayed an “E3” message since the beginning of camp. Showalter said the display was because he didn’t want players complaining about the temperature, but later indicated there is a mechanical glitch that should be fixed soon. Full-squad workouts continue in preparation for Saturday’s split-squad Grapefruit League openers.
