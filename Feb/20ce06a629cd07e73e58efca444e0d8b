A red-headed female arsonist was caught on video setting fire to a pride flag outside a Soho restaurant early Monday, sparking a hate-crime investigation, authorities said. The firebug torched the rainbow flag in front of the Little Prince restaurant on Prince Street near MacDougal Street in Manhattan around 1:30 a.m., cops said. The suspect may have used a lighter to set the fire, cops said. The fire, which also damaged part of the outside of the building, was extinguished by the FDNY, police said. No structural damage was reported. The woman had been driven up to the establishment in a white four-door SUV and hopped out and lit the flag ablaze. She then jumped back in the vehicle and was driven off. The NYPDâ€™s Hate Crime Task Force was notified and is investigating the incident, cops said.
