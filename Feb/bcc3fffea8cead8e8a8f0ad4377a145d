The Pac-12 mens’ basketball conference season is quickly wrapping up and nothing has become more apparent than the first-half strength of the Arizona Wildcats. With two regular-season games remaining, the Wildcats have been around the Top 10 Associated Press rankings — currently they are No. 8 with a 23-4 record — all season. Arizona has compiled a 12-4 conference record with a scoring average of 83.4 points a game. But as good as those numbers look, the Wildcats might be smidge better in first-half scoring, according to Team Rankings. The reasons to bet them against Colorado on Saturday goes even deeper. Arizona (-7.5) has the nation’s No. 2 first-half offense, averaging 41.3 points a game. It was first until Gonzaga dropped 68 first-half points at Loyola Marymount on Thursday night. However, the Wildcats’ numbers are a model of consistency. They have averaged 43.7 first-half points in their last three games and their home average stands at 42.7 ppg. Arizona’s Thursday night win over Utah was no different. The Wildcats’ 43-31 first half easily covered the first-half spread (-6). Until last Sunday’s loss at Stanford, Arizona was trending up in the first half, covering against Oregon and Oregon State at home and at California. Throw in the Colorado’s numbers and the argument becomes more compelling. The Buffaloes (15-12 overall and 7-9 conference) are ranked seventh in the league, they’re averaging 34.1 points a game in the first half. The Buffs are worse on the road, falling to 32.1 points a game. This makes Arizona an even stronger bet. If you’re looking for a solid prime-time pick that won’t keep you up too late, take the Wildcats and make money before the second half begins.
