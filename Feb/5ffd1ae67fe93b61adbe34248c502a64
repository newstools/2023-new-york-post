Two firefighters were hurt after a fire ripped through a Brooklyn e-bike store, damaging dozens of the devices, officials said. The episode unfolded at around 2:15 a.m. Saturday at the 11th Avenue Bike Shop at 6308 11th Avenue, near 63rd Street in Dyker Heights, the FDNY said. Firefighters battled the blaze for nearly two hours before declaring the fire under control, officials said. At least 50 e-bikes were inside the shop and dozens were damaged, one witness reported. Two firefighters were taken to an area hospital with minor injuries. The cause of the blaze is “under investigation,” the FDNY said Saturday morning. E-bike-related fires seem to be occurring fast and furious. Earlier this week, a 67-year-old woman was critically injured in a massive early-morning Brooklyn fire caused by e-bike batteries, officials said Tuesday. That inferno tore through all three floors of the home on Goodwin Place near Greene Avenue in Bushwick around 4:40 a.m. — marking the city’s 24th fire caused by lithium ion batteries since the start of the year, the FDNY said. In less than two years, at least 11 people were killed and 251 were injured in NYC fires sparked by lithium-ion batteries used to power e-bikes and e-scooters, the FDNY said. Lithium ion batteries were the cause of the fourth most fire deaths last year, the FDNY said, behind electrical, portable heaters and smoking.
