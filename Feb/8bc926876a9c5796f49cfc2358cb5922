We still don’t know what’s in the classified documents that’ve popped up in President Joe Biden’s home and old office, but he’s sure sounding like he has something to hide. After weeks of insisting that he doesn’t know what’s in the cache after cache of classified documents squirreled away at his think-tank office and private home, and his lawyers have told him not to ask, he suddenly said to PBS they’re just “stray papers” from 1974. He’s also insisting it must have been staffers that did any wrong. That might explain him recalling nothing — except some of the docs were apparently in a folder with other material for a book he wrote about his time as veep. Actually, his remark was so hedged that it really said nothing: “The best of my knowledge, the kinds of things they picked up are things that are from 1974 and stray papers — there may be something else, I don’t know” (emphasis added). And none of that explains why he sent lawyers (themselves lacking the clearances to handle classified stuff) to sniff around his old files. Or why either the White House or the Justice Department stopped the National Archives from mentioning the first find in November. By the way, if his staffers “didn’t do the kind of job that should have been done” packing up his White House office, as he claims, that’s his fault as their boss. (And who works in the White House and doesn’t know how to handled classified docs, anyway?) All this follows his earlier “no regrets” line, which amounts to “these laws are for the little people.” And ignores the fact that influence-peddling First Son Hunter Biden had access to the Wilmington garage where many docs were tossed. At the very least, Mr. President, stop playing the victim.
