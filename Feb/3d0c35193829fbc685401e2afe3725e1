A mugger beat a straphanger with a cane and kicked him down the stairs at a Manhattan subway station while stealing his cellphone, cops said. The crook had asked the 45-year-old victim if he could use his phone inside the West 110th Street and Central Park West station just before 10 p.m. Jan. 23, police said Monday. The man agreed — which is when the suspect swung a cane at him, hitting him in the right side of the face and causing minor bleeding, police said. The thief tried to get away, and the victim followed him up the stairs leading out of the station. At one point, the assailant turned and kicked him down the stairs, police said. The victim suffered minor injuries. Surveillance footage released by the NYPD shows the suspect wearing a red jacket, red du-rag with a Yankees cap over it, and a gold elephant chain. He is shown walking with a metal crutch and carrying an orange tote bag. Police are asking for the public’s help in tracking him down.
