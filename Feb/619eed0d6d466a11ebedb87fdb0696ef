It’s safe to say this doctor has severed his political ties. Brazilian surgeons redefined “obstruction of justice” after accidentally leaving surgical scissors inside a local politician’s body during a procedure. The fiasco occurred on Jan. 20 after Cleyton Jose Zanatta, a city councilman for Nova Santa Helena municipality in the central-western state of Mato Grosso, reported to a nearby regional hospital in Colíder to have a tumor removed from his intestines, Newsflash reported. While the gut renovation seemingly went off without a hitch, the politician realized something was awry after feeling ill six days after the operation. The Brazilian Social Democracy Party member returned to the same hospital, where a CT scan revealed a large pair of scissors inside his intestines. Bungling surgeons had reportedly left these suture-slicing instruments inside Zanatta while sewing him up post-op. They quickly removed the surgical stowaway from the pol, who recovered from the medical mishap and is now reportedly in stable condition, according to his health-care team. This isn’t the first time absent-minded doctors have accidentally left a patient with a souvenir from surgery. In September, a woman finally had a strip of gauze removed from her body over 20 years after a forgetful physician left it in her intestine during a procedure. In a story closer to home in May, New York medics left a 10-inch breathing tube in a Queens man’s body — and didn’t realize the mistake or retrieve it for over three decades. “I just feel like … a little angry. Just for the simple fact that they left this inside of me,” the former patient, Rene Remache, 39, told The Post. “It could have been worse than what the outcome was. I thank God I am still here. I have a beautiful daughter that I might not have been raising.”
