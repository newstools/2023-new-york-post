Pink’s ninth studio album, released on Friday, is called “Trustfall,” and the singer says that making the LP helped her cope with her own crisis of faith. “In order to be a human being in this world today, it requires a lot of trust, like just to … drop your kids off at school and participate in elections and have an opinion,” Pink said at an album release party held 101 floors up in the sky at the Edge overlooking Manhattan. “ ‘Trustfall’ is sort of [about] two things … I feel like we’re falling backwards, and the ground is uncertain. But it’s also that freedom and letting go, trusting and having faith in the universe that it’s going to take care of you.” And the 43-year-old mother of two — daughter Willow, 11, and son Jameson, 5 — takes comfort in the fact that “I know if my kids had the muscles, they would catch me.” Making “Trustfall” tunes such as first single “Never Gonna Not Dance Again” — which Pink performed on roller skates to open the American Music Awards last November —  helped the artist deal with her issues during the pandemic. “I wrote ‘Never Gonna Not Dance Again’ because I felt like the world was ending,” said Pink, who also performed acoustic renditions of new tunes “When I Get There” and “Trustfall” at the event, where she was interviewed by Peloton star Cody Rigsby. “I’m not wasting any more time. I worry so much. I’m in my head so much. We all have such low-level trauma … we can’t deal with it all the time. Sometimes we just have to dance and stop beating ourselves up.”
