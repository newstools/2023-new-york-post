He’s still winging it. The Eurasian eagle-owl liberated from his Central Park Zoo enclosure by vandals earlier this week was spotted Saturday not far from home. Flaco — whose name means skinny in Spanish — was perched high in a tree above the park’s Hallet Nature Sanctuary, the Manhattan Bird Alert account tweeted Saturday morning. The owl, which has been in captivity for 12 years, has likely “lost the skills needed for catching wild prey, and so will not be able to obtain food on his own in the wild,” the bird lover’s account said. The sanctuary is just south of the zoo, where vandals Thursday night damaged the exhibit where Flaco lives and cut stainless steel mesh to set him free. The owl has since evaded capture, leading to jokes that he’s a real “HOO-Dini.” Zoo staff kept an eye on the owl throughout the night on Thursday as it sat in a tree but it then flew off. The loose owl has sent bird watchers to the park to try to get a glimpse of it. One photographer tweeted a photo of Flaco giving a “mischievous” wink.
