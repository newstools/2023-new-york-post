With Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week having just concluded, you may have been pondering about accessories that were scene-stealers during the shows, and no, we’re not talking about Kylie Jenner’s lion headdress. Celebrity guests and models aside, fashion weeks in Paris always serve as a reminder that there’s no better staple in your closet than a good cashmere scarf or shawl. It’s laced around the necks of nearly every French woman, and it has long been proven to spice up any outfit you wear. The only downside? Cashmere shawls — or cashmere anything, for that matter — are quite expensive, especially if you’re gunning for high-quality ones. But there are non-bank-breaking options, like the Lavisha Cashmere Shawl, which happens to be on sale in time for Valentine’s Day if you order by February 3. Whether you’re giving yourself a treat, buying one for your partner, or gifting your girl buds for Galentine’s Day, it’s too sweet of a deal to miss out on. With winter in full swing, you’re sure to reach out for any article of clothing that would keep you warm and cozy. Why not make it fashionable while at it? Not every piece of winter-wear is designed to make you look like a snowman, and this cashmere accessory is proof. It’s made out of warm and elegant cashmere wool for an ultra-luxe feel and added comfort when draped over your shoulders. While it features a solid, rich color, it has a soft fringe around the edges for a touch of style, enhancing any outfit you wear. If you’re worried about the coziness level, this shawl features six feet of length, which makes it capable of helping you bundle up and stay warm on chillier days. It comes in various fun and classic colors, too, including creamy beige, indigo blue, heather grey, and flamingo pink. Upgrade your winter wardrobe and grab the Lavisha Cashmere Shawl on sale for only $14.99 now through February 6 — but be sure to order by February 3 to get it in time for V-Day. Prices subject to change.
