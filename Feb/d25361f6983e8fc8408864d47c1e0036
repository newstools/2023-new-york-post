Be ready for the worst and look cute, too. This subterranean Texas compound offers not only a prepper-ready shelter — but also a number of homey finishes and natural elements, to boot. Partially submerged beneath the soil of Salado — a town located an hour’s drive north of Austin — this unique abode is ideal for laying low and living through judgment day without fully sacrificing the comforts of modern life. The two-bedroom, 2.5-bath single-family house offers more than 2,400 square feet of residential living space that has one foot where the sun shines and the other within the earth. “Nestled in the beautiful and best part of Salado, this home was thoughtfully and artfully designed by antique dealers who liked to entertain and show off their furnishings,” HomeSmart agent Shirley Kopecky told The Post of how the $425,000 listing came to be. “This house has all the bells and whistles and was outfitted — at great expense — for uncertain weather.” The first owners also custom-built the dwelling with Santa Fe, New Mexico in mind, so that, once one has accepted the concrete structure and its unusual layout, they might pick up on a “southwestern vibe” in the more intentional, less functional part of the aesthetic. There’s a large kitchen, an attached garage, exposed brick walls and — aboveground on the “picturesque” .939-acre lot — views of a pond, a seasonal stream, plenty of trees and two gated entrances. The listing advertises the home as “off-grid capable,” listing a water well, two storage tanks, two rainwater tanks, a tankless water heater, three buried propane tanks, solar panels, a generator and city water among the hook-ups. Should future owners wish to venture beyond their bunker, the Mill Creek Golf Course is a short drive away and, if not in the mood for the formality of a car, golf carts are kosher too. They can legally be driven throughout the town.
