Federal prosecutors on Friday indicted a Russian national for smuggling sensitive US technology to Russia and North Korea. In an indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors alleged Ilya Balakaev’s US company Radiotester LLC had contracts with the FSB — Russia’s intelligence and security agency— to repair spectrum analyzers and signal generators. Balakaev, 47, of Moscow, would repair the devices, which were used as part of counterintelligence operations to sweep for surveillance bugs and transmit covert communications, according to court documents. Prosecutors charged that in 2017, Balakaev started a network of individuals in the US to help him buy equipment to repair the devices — a violation of US sanctions — while working with Kremlin officials responsible for Russia’s communication security and cryptology. Balakaev allegedly had at least 10 contracts with the FSB military unit, bought some 43 devices in the US, and traveled back and from Moscow, where he lives, to the US about 14 times over approximately four years. He also provided US technology to a North Korean government official, violating US sanctions against North Korea, prosecutors charge. “As alleged, the defendant violated U.S. law by procuring, smuggling, and repairing counterintelligence operation devices for the benefit of Russia’s secret police and the North Korean government,” US Attorney for the Eastern District Breon Peace said in a statement. “Today’s indictment demonstrates our Office’s commitment to vigorously prosecute those who evade sanctions for a profit, both for their wallet and for Russia as they continue their aggression against Ukraine.”
