Florida Man has hit a truly pathetic new low. President Donald Trump is effectively disavowing his own vaccine fast-tracking effort Operation Warp Speed — a miraculous success, by any reasonable standard — in order to play to the more deranged segment of his voter base and attack likely 2024 GOP rival Gov. Ron DeSantis. “The real Ron is a RINO GLOBALIST,” he blared on Truth Social Wednesday, one who “Loved the Vaccines.” The same vaccines, in other words, that Team Trump fought to have developed and produced in record time, against jeers from his opponents and general incredulity. The same vaccines that, when Trump delivered on his promise, saved countless lives. That’s what Trump is willing to discard in his pursuit of power. And no method is too tone-deaf or stupid, as usual: His allies are reportedly creating an “oppo file” on DeSantis that includes footage of him praising the vaccines and even — gasp! — helping old people get vaccinated. Yeah, that will sink DeSantis for sure. It’s crucial to remember here that Warp Speed was, quite literally, the only good element of the COVID response Trump presided over. Everything else, from the CDC’s pointless, endless, anti-science rules to the elevation of Dr. Anthony Fauci, ended in complete disaster — largely because the president utterly caved to the deranged authoritarian impulses of his top “science advisers.” The cost these failures inflicted on America is vast and still not fully measured. We and our children will be paying for it for a long time, through a disrupted economy, massive learning loss and huge social damage. But Warp Speed, of which Trump himself once said “They say it’s somewhat of a miracle, and I think that’s true,” is what he wants to throw overboard. It would be funny if it weren’t so sad.
