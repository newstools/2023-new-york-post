Michael Irvin’s attorney is speaking out against Marriott in the wake of his client’s $100 million lawsuit against a female hotel employee who accused the Hall of Famer of misconduct during an interaction at Super Bowl week in Arizona. In a statement Tuesday to The Dallas Morning News, Levi McCathern — who is representing the former Cowboys wide receiver — said he is “mad as hell” as footage of the alleged incident has not yet been released, despite a judge setting a Feb. 20 deadline for the hotel to do so. “I’m mad as hell that they’re hiding this stuff that is so relevant to my client’s livelihood,” said McCathern, a Dallas-based attorney. “I think it is terrible they’re doing that. I don’t know what’s on the video. None of us have gotten to see it. But I sure think that, at a minimum, Michael has got a right to see the video.” Marriott is said to have given “a lengthy explanation as to why it wouldn’t provide each item,” per The Dallas Morning News, while McCathern noted further efforts to obtain the footage Tuesday “were in vain.” A court document secured by the outlet also detailed how Marriott “was asked to produce any written reports and/or witness statements involving Irvin’s stay at the Phoenix hotel.” As for Irvin’s representation, they are said to have wanted the name and contact details of those employed by the hotel “who made a complaint against Irvin, alleged to have been offended by Irvin’s conduct or who contacted the NFL about his conduct.” Irvin was removed from NFL Network’s Super Bowl 2023 coverage this month in the wake of the alleged incident. The 56-year-old previously told The Dallas Morning News that there “absolutely was no sexual wrongdoing,” and that he engaged in a “45-second conversation” with the woman in the lobby of the Arizona hotel. On Monday, The Athletic reported how Marriott is looking to move Irvin’s lawsuit to federal court.
