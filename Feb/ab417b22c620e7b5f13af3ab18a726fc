They’re speaking the love languages. A couple who met on the language-learning app Duolingo has tied the knot. According to a blog post in honor of Valentine’s Day, the lovebirds’ meet-cute occurred in 2021, years after Amanda Lopez downloaded the app in hopes of learning more Mandarin. It wasn’t until Rob Ciesielski, who joined the app in 2020, kept congratulating Lopez on her in-app achievements that the two digitally got acquainted via Facebook. After swapping online messages, video calls and texts between the US and the Philippines due to coronavirus pandemic travel restrictions, they’ve come “quite a way” from their technological talks, eventually uniting in person last summer. The pair just tied the knot last month in Lopez’s home country, the Philippines. The official Duolingo account congratulated the happy couple via Twitter, sharing two photos – one of the couple’s online profiles and another from their wedding day – side by side. “How it started,” the tweet read, “how it’s going.” The tweet prompted hopeless romantics and language lovers to both celebrate the pair’s union and crack a few jokes, shocked that a learning app could cultivate true love. “Meeting through Duolingo is CRAZY,” tweeted one baffled user. “Is this what we call love language,” quipped another. “You can really find love anywhere omfg,” chimed in someone else. “Gonna be very committed to my Duolingo studies now,” tweeted one singleton. “Duolingo is the new Tinder and I’m here for it,” championed another. “Gonna delete Bumble and Tinder rn,” someone else wrote. Lopez seemed just as surprised about the unconventional use of the linguistic app. “I am still floored to this day that I met him on a language learning app. Who would have thought learning a language on a mobile app could bring you true love?” she said in the blog post.
