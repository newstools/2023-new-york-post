One of the victims mowed down in Brooklyn Monday by a crazed man driving a U-Haul truck has died, law enforcement sources said. The victim, a 44-year-old man on an e-bike, succumbed from his injuries hours after the rampage that left at least seven others injured in Bay Ridge, the sources said. The e-bike rider had been struck by the truck on Bay Ridge Parkway and Fifth Avenue and was initially hospitalized in critical condition. The alleged driver of the truck, identified by senior law enforcement sources as 62-year-old homeless man Weng Sor, was taken into custody after leading police on a wild chase where he recklessly drove through streets and sidewalks for about 30 minutes. He dared cops to shoot him and later said he wanted to die once he was captured, sources said. Sor remained at the 68th Precinct late Monday and has yet to be charged. The suspect has a history of mental illness, including in 2019 when cops responded to a mental health call because he was yelling and jumping into moving traffic on a Queens street, sources said.
