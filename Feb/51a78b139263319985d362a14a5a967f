Chaya Raichik, the founder of the anti-woke social media account “Libs of TikTok,” is publishing her first kid’s book next month. Raichik, 28, who has spent the past two years tweeting TikTok videos of liberals spouting off about gender identity and other hot-button culture war issues — amassing over 1.9 million followers in the process — says the book is her “next step.” “I wanted to do the next step, which is to give parents and children a tool that they can use to actually be able to spot predatory behavior,” she told The Post. Raichik’s debut picture book, “No More Secrets: The Candy Cavern,” tells the story of Rose, a second-grade lamb whose new teacher, Mr. Wooly, is more bent on giving his pupils sweets than teaching them about counting and reading.  Mr. Wooly urges the young lambs not to tell their parents about the excessive candy and cakes, for reasons that become clear after they learn their teacher is actually a wolf. “This book basically teaches children that if there is a trusted adult or an authority who’s telling you to keep secrets from your parents…then that is a big red flag,” the former Brooklyn real estate agent said. The book’s subtext is based on longstanding criticisms by parents that schools are encouraging gender transition in young students without informing parents. Its conservative publisher, Brave Books, has tackled trans issues in the past, most recently with their children’s book “Elephants Are Not Birds.” Critics claim Raichik’s Twitter posts have led to threats of violence and harassment against their subjects. The social media firebrand said she’s undeterred, claiming the real danger is that grownups are “sterilizing” children and providing them adult-themed entertainment at school. “They can call me whatever they want, they can blame whatever they want on me, but I’m not going to stop doing this work,” Raichik said.
