Jennifer Coolidge got into the spirit of the scene. David Harbour claimed Monday that the “White Lotus” star asked him to choke her while filming a scene in the new horror film “We Have a Ghost.” “We have this amazing moment where there’s a CGI thing that shoots out of my face, and it’s a hand and it strangles her,” Harbour, 47, said of the spooky revelation during an appearance on “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” “So I did it with my hand [during filming] and she was, like, really pissed,” the “Stranger Things” star recalled. “She stopped the take and was like, ‘David! You’ve gotta really strangle me! You gotta strangle me!'” Harbour said he simply could not do it. “I was, like, ‘I’m not gonna murder America’s sweetheart!'” he explained. “She was, like, ‘Come on!'” “We Have a Ghost,” out Feb. 24 on Netflix, tells the story of a family — led by Coolidge and Marvel star Anthony Mackie — who moves into a new home, only to find that it is already occupied by a ghost name Ernest, played by Harbour. The family then uses the paranormal spirit as a chance to become an internet sensation. The “Brokeback Mountain” actor said that he learned a lot from the “American Pie” actor. “There is a scene in the film where I frighten her, and she runs screaming and jumps out a window,” said Harbour. “I swear, we did about 15 takes and every take she was, like, ‘Let’s try it again. Maybe I could go like this [makes spooky, scary noises].’ I’ve never seen every animal, every sound — it was a lesson. It was an acting class.” Harbour apparently has a deep respect for 61-year-old Coolidge, whose most recent work involved channeling a dolphin in a Super Bowl 2023 ad for e.l.f. Cosmetics. “She is as amazing as you think she would be,” gushed Harbour. “It’s just what you see on a talk show or at an awards show — it just is that, and it’s not that way with some of us.” “We Have a Ghost” is set to haunt its way onto Netflix on Feb. 24.
