How do you say I love you to your lover on Valentine’s Day? Is it in the form of a giant stuffed animal? Or how about a box of fancy chocolates? There’s no one way to make your loved one feel appreciated on the Day of Love, but if you want to go against the norm, consider gifting them something they’ll find useful, and not have to throw away the next day. For the tech lover, perhaps they’ll be delighted with receiving a refurbished iPad Mini. A like-new iPad mini 4 is on sale for under $180 just in time for Valentine’s Day. It may seem odd to gift your lover a refurbished item on Valentine’s Day, but refurbished gadgets are technically vetted to look and function like new, so you’re still giving them something almost fresh off the box. Plus, you won’t contribute to e-waste. This iPad Mini 4 boasts a 7.9-inch Retina display for crystal-clear browsing, streaming, and gaming, and a powerful A8 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture for a seamless, non-laggy performance. It also comes equipped with an 8-megapixel camera, FaceTime HD camera, Touch ID, Apple Pay, Wi-Fi, and up to 10 hours of battery life. A generous 16GB of internal storage is built-in for storing essential files and media, and it comes pre-installed with productivity and creativity apps for easy multitasking. Clocking in at only 6.5mm and 0.65 lbs, you won’t have a problem transporting it from one place to another. Simply slip it in your purse and you’re good to go. If you opt to buy a brand-new iPad mini 4, you’re looking at a $599 wallet damage, but if you take advantage of this refurb deal, you can snag one for only $179.99. Prices subject to change.
