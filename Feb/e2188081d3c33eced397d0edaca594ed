David Bowie and Iman were beloved residents of 285 Lafayette St. from around 1999 until Bowie’s 2016 passing, when New Yorkers erected a cordoned-off shrine outside the downtown Manhattan building. Now, a penthouse there is on the market for a hefty $18.5 million — down from its $19.99 million ask last fall. The seller — whose identity is hidden behind an LLC — is prepared to take a slight hit on the property, which was purchased for $20.86 million in 2017, according to property records. The 5,350-square-foot, six-bedroom home comes with two private terraces, including one separated from Bowie and Iman’s former home by a row of planted bamboo. The residence comes with 20 oversize windows, with 120 feet facing Lafayette Street, and 12 sets of French doors that lead to the terraces. Design details include 11-foot ceilings and a private elevator landing that opens to a foyer, which leads to a living/dining room anchored by a gas-burning fireplace. Next is a chef’s kitchen with a 146-bottle Sub-Zero wine fridge and access to one of the terraces. The main bedroom features two walk-in closets, one with a custom-built dressing room, along with a windowed bath. There’s also a family room with a second fireplace that leads to a wrap terrace and more bedrooms. The late 19th-century building was once the Hawley & Hoops chocolate factory. Other celebrity residents in the building have included hotelier Ian Schrager, who added on penthouse floors when he did the condo conversion in 1999, said listing broker Brett Mitchell, of Compass. Mitchell is co-listing the property with Leonard Steinberg, also of Compass. Fellow residents include Paul Tudor Jones. Past residents have included Hugh Jackman, Jude Law, Sienna Miller, Alex Rodriguez and Courtney Love. The unit was staged by IMG’s Cheryl Eisen in cool and textured neutrals and natural materials.
