King Charles offered a hilarious response when asked whether his estranged son Prince Harry would be welcomed back into the royal fold. The monarch, 74, was meeting with students at the University of East London Wednesday when one fan brazenly asked the burning question: “Can you bring back Harry?” “Who?” Charles bluntly responded. According to the Mirror, it appeared the king actually didn’t hear the complete question — and his reply was not intended to sass his son, 38. Once he realized what the fan had actually said, Charles gave a short laugh before quickly moving on. Relations between Charles and Harry have been strained since the latter left the United Kingdom with his wife, Meghan Markle, in 2020, citing media harassment. Harry was angered after Charles and the rest of the royals refused to agree to his “half in, half out” proposal, in which he wanted to represent the monarchy from Canada while also earning an independent income. The relationship between father and son has not recovered and is now at rock bottom following the publication of Harry’s bombshell memoir “Spare.” In the tome, Harry takes a savage spray at his dad’s wife, Queen Consort Camilla, accusing her of leaking negative stories about him. Despite the deterioration of their relationship, Charles reportedly wants Harry to attend his coronation in May. The king allegedly believes the prince’s absence will only cause more drama than his attendance. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Charles will address his relationship with Harry in a highly anticipated BBC profile ahead of his official ascent to the throne. Insiders have been speculating that Charles could use the interview as an opportunity to discuss recent claims made by Harry in his book. “Plans are already up and running for coronation coverage at the BBC, including the profile on the monarch,” an insider told the Mirror recently. “It is not the done thing to avoid subjects in interviews, so it makes matters tricky.”
