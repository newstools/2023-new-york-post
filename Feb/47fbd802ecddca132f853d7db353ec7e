Tiger Woods is back in his element. The 15-time major champion brought his A-game and trash talk to the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club. On Thursday, Woods, who opened the event with a 2-under 69, gifted his playing partner Justin Thomas with a Tampon after outdriving him on the ninth hole. The pair were seen smiling as Thomas took the feminine product from Woods, who leaned on Thomas’ shoulder doubled over in laughter. “If anyone tries to cancel Tiger over this we riot. It’s funny,” golf influencer Paige Spiranac wrote on Twitter. Woods ended his opening round with a flourish, making birdies on the final three holes. He was laughing with Thomas and Rory McIlroy throughout the round. The PGA Tour shared a video on Twitter that showed Woods smirking at Thomas, which had golf fans in their feels. “Golf is just better when Tiger is playing,” Spiranac wrote, including the video in her tweet. The crowd at Riviera supported Woods throughout the round, chanting “Ti-ger, Ti-ger” throughout the 18 holes. At one point, Woods also outdrove McIlroy — known as one of the longer hitters on the PGA Tour. “I’m going to go work on the range. I put my driver up a click in loft at the start of the week, I might have to turn it back down again,” McIlroy said. “I don’t like him hitting it by me.” The Genesis Invitational, which was hosted by Woods, marked the 47-year-old pro’s first event since last year’s British Open. “I didn’t want to be the idiot host that missed it,” Woods, who is tied for 27th, said Thursday. Woods appeared to be walking well on the hills at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles as he is still recovering from severe lower left leg injuries he sustained in a single-car crash in February 2021. Woods’ health will be tested on Friday morning, as he does a quick turnaround for the second round of the event. “I’ve had so many surgeries that the ankle keeps changing, the leg keeps changing, the shoes keep changing, the socks keep changing,” Woods said.
