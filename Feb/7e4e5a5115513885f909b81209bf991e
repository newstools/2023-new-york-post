Mariah Carey likes it hot. “Some Like it Hot” composers Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman thrilled the crowd at their Broadway musical after Friday night’s performance by welcoming to the stage one of the show’s producers — Carey. In his intro, Shaiman declared that “some like it hot — but she likes it cold because that means Christmas, and she’s the Queen of Christmas!” Unsurprisingly, the crowd and cast went bananas as the “Emotions” singer bounded on stage. Carey, 53, solidified her diva status by noting that, “I did have a special favorite place where the lighting was gorgeous, and I was like, ‘When I get up there I don’t want the side lighting, I want the frontal lighting!'” She also revealed the show, which is based on the 1959 Billy Wilder movie of the same name, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, has a special place in her heart. “‘Some Like it Hot’ has a very special significance for me because I grew up loving Marilyn Monroe,” Carey shared, “because my mom was a big fan of hers, and then I found out about her and learned about her and read books by Norman Mailer [about her], which were too much for any girl!” The five-time Grammy winner thanked the cast before admitting she hadn’t really rehearsed her speech. “I didn’t rehearse, I tend to not rehearse enough — that’s one of my faults,” she said with a laugh. “Some Like it Hot” stars two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, J. Harrison Ghee and Adrianna Hicks.
