She didn’t flip for his Valentine’s Day pancakes. One TikTok user thought her husband was buttering her up for the holiday by making her breakfast — but instead of a heart, he appeared to fashion the batter into a starchy schlong. Madison Sandoval shared the NSFW video to the platform on Sunday, and it has already served over 1.9 million views and over 104,000 likes. “When you think your husband is being sweet making you heart-shaped pancakes for Valentine’s Day,” she wrote in white text over a clip of the pancake, which appeared to be shaped like a heart and adorned with red fruit bits. The camera then cuts to a long, unmistakably shaped hotcake preening among circular duds. “But then you remember he’s a guy,” she penned over the pic of the phallic pancake. In the comments section, users roasted the Vee-Dee pee-pee. “Did not see this coming,” one commenter joked. “No pun intended.” Another giggled, “This is priceless .” “Well I think he made the perfect love statement here forget about the heart …. ” someone else proclaimed. “Reason #12750 of why I’m a lesbian ,” a viewer declared. Some people even revealed their significant others had baked similar things for them. “My husband has been making these for years,” one woman confessed. Another claimed, “Something my boyfriend would do hands down .” This isn’t the first time someone has gotten dirty in the kitchen. In December, a TikTok baking influencer came under fire for making a cake for her daughter’s birthday of her favorite toy — but it turned out looking like a “dil-dough.” And, in 2020, an Ohio woman even called the police after she received a cut of turkey from the supermarket that looked exactly like male genitalia.
