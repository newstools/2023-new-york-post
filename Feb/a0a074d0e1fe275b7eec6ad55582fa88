He took a heel turn. A Florida politician was found with 10 grams of cocaine stuffed in his shoe after speeding away from a chaotic traffic stop Saturday night, officials said. Police pulled over Palm Bay City Councilman Pete Filiberto at 11:50 p.m. after he was spotted speeding on a motorcycle, according to cops. The local official ran several stop signs and whizzed through a residential neighborhood at well over the speed limit, according to FOX 35. Filiberto — who has two prior DWI busts — suddenly attempted to flee the traffic stop after the officer turned his back, but soon lost control of his bike during a bungled U-turn and toppled over. The officer caught up with Filiberto and smelled booze on his breath. The councilman declined to speak to the cop and refused to take a breath test before being taken into custody. While in a holding cell, cops asked Filiberto, 34, to take off his shoes and found 10.6 grams of cocaine secreted inside one of his socks. The Surfside resident, who was elected just last year, was charged with cocaine possession, reckless driving, DUI, refusing a breath test and other raps. A notice of bond correction obtained by the Space Coast Rocket showed he had previously been busted for DUI in 2008 and 2019. A contractor with the Department of Veteran Affairs, Filiberto is the vice chairman of the Brevard County Planning and Zoning Board. He is also the son of a doctor and former mayor of Palm Bay, Frank Filiberto. Filiberto bonded out of jail and will return to court at a later date.
