Chris Drury took a shot and scored on Thursday, just like he did 255 times in his NHL playing career. However, this time, he did it as the Rangers GM, making a blockbuster trade that greatly improved the team’s chances at a Stanley Cup championship. Drury traded Sammy Blais, Hunter Skinner and draft picks to the St. Louis Blues for Vladimir Tarasenko and Niko Mikkola. Rangers beat writer Mollie Walker and Hall of Famer Larry Brooks break down the trade and discuss if the move could help the Rangers eventually raise the Cup at the end of the season. Later, Mollie answers some questions from her subtext mailbag.
