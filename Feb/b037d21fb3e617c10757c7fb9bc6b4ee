It’s time for Mommy Gras. A couple has gone viral after having a gender reveal during a Mardi Gras celebration Thursday in Alabama. Justin and Bianca Robinson, who were visiting Mobile, said that they wanted to have some fun when they told family members, reports WALA. According to Justin, it was “go big or go home!” “What better way to figure out the gender — and share this with our family during Mardi Gras,” said Robinson. According to the father-to-be, the only person who knew the gender of the child was Justin’s Aunt Jada who helped the couple break the news. “As we’re waiting there’s other floats riding by and people were still trying to catch stuff… My nerves were so bad,” recalled Bianca Robinson. “It was just like waiting and waiting and waiting for our float to come by.” Thankfully, the expecting mother was left in doubt for not much longer. It was then pink smoke bombs went off revealing the couple would have a baby girl. “The beads starting throwing… I’m just excited – I’m jumping up and trying to catch the beads so I can have a keepsake memory,” the expecting father said. “For a lot of first-time fathers — they know exactly when that feeling kicks in. Because that was the moment that it kicked in — I’m about to be a dad — and it just made cherish and love her that much more” “Like you’re my wife — you’re the mother of my child — we’re going to raise a little girl together,” continued Robinson. The Mardi Gras reveal is on the tamer end of a string of gender reveals. One deadly reveal caused the death of New York’s mysterious pink bird — aptly named “flamingo.” The bird was picked up in Madison Square Park by the Wild Bird Fund and instantly mystified authorities. “Despite our best efforts to reduce the fumes coming off the dye, while keeping him calm and stable, he died in the night,” said the WBF. “We believe his death was caused by inhaling the toxins.” Another gender reveal sent sparks online when the family’s reveal almost burned down their house.
