Once again displaying her total obliviousness, Republican National Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced Sunday that 2024 presidential candidates will likely have to pledge to support the winner in the general election, or they’ll be kept out of the primary debates. Who cares? This is nothing but a lame attempt to paper over the party’s stark divisions over ex-President Donald Trump, one of three declared candidates so far. The simple fact is that many GOP voters won’t support him if he’s the nominee, and some of his voters likely won’t show for any other Republican. And all GOP politicians will jump whichever way they think serves their interests best. That includes the candidates themselves: Coming up with excuses to break your most solemn pledge is Politics 101, all across the spectrum. The real questions turn on what, if any, third-party challenge the loser(s) mount, and who’s peeved enough to spend the general election dumping on the winner. The main thing that will change all the calculations is how quickly the voters break either for Trump or some other rival, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the early leader to play that role. And the debates (whoever shows) will be key. Stop pretending you can actually chart Republicans’ course, Ronna. It’s not remotely up to you.
